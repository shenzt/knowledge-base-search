This massive growth also means these companies now have an outsized impact on the performance of the market itself. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, these 5 tech stocks were responsible for more than 20% of the S&P 500’s 31% return in 2019. When you see a handful of stocks dominate in such a way it can make some investors nervous. What happens to the stock market if these companies begin to sell off? Is the rest of the market participating in this rally or is it all being driven by just a small number of stocks? One of the things that jumps out from this list is how high the turnover at the top can be. Every decade there were at least five to six new names at the top of the list. While technology firms dominate the top slots today, in the early-1980s it was energy companies. The behemoth tech stocks have taken advantage of these trends but it was not preordained that these companies would be where they are today. Apple was rescued by Microsoft with a $150 million loan in 1997 which was one year before Google was founded. Jeff Bezos started Amazon in a garage in 1994.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.0681,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76e9578a\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the day.This can be contrasted with today\\'s low, which is the trading day\\'s intraday low price. Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade. Based upon this analysis, they implement trading strategies and capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.5479,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a54493c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a54493c-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/0a54493c.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc - ADR Shares Close the Day 11.0% Higher - Daily Wrap ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc - ADR Shares Close the Day 11.0% Higher - Daily Wrap ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc - ADR (XPEV) shares closed today 11.0% higher than it did at the end of yesterday.

The economy can be broken down into sectors, which group stocks with similar business characteristics together. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) divides the market into 11 sectors, composed of 25 industry groups and 74 industries, as of March 2023. The commonly-used system helps shape how ETFs and mutual funds are constructed. One alternative to the GICS schema is the Industry Classification Benchmark, or ICB. The ICB was developed in 2005 by Dow Jones and FTSE, and divides the market into 11 industries, 20 supersectors and then further into sectors and subsectors. It’s now used by the NASDAQ, NYSE and other international markets. The information technology sector includes companies that produce software and other IT products and services. It also contains companies that manufacture hardware such as communications equipment, mobile phones, computers and semiconductor equipment. This sector has been a fast grower and contains some of the market’s largest companies.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.0158,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"513facad\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"513facad-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 7,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/archive/CURRENT_STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"CURRENT_STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"项目当前状态总结 > 📊 系统指标 > 待验证指标\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"unknown\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"| 指标 | 值 | 状态 |\\\\\\\\n|------|-----|------|\\\\\\\\n| 混合检索准确性 | 0.94 | ✅ 优秀 |\\\\\\\\n| 响应时间 | 0.26s | ✅ 快速 |\\\\\\\\n| 索引成功率 | 100% | ✅ 完美 |\\\\\\\\n| 成本降低 | 70-80% | ✅ 显著 |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| 指标 | 目标 | 状态 |\\\\\\\\n|------|------|------|\\\\\\\\n| E2E 测试通过率 | > 80% | 🔄 测试中 |\\\\\\\\n| 关键词覆盖率 | > 60% | 🔄 测试中 |\\\\\\\\n| 跨语言准确性 | > 70% | 🔄 测试中 |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"agent_hint\\\\\": \\\\\"[overview | gaps:incomplete_steps,missing_example]\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"evidence_flags\\\\\": {\\\\n      \\\\\"has_command\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_config\\\\\": true,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_code_block\\\\\": true,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_steps\\\\\": true\\\\n    }\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.0412,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6d4f6960\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6d4f6960-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/6d4f6960.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"What the S&P 500 Tells You About Americas Health\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"What the S&P 500 Tells You About America\\'s Health\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"S&amp;P stands for <strong>Standard and Poor</strong>, the names of the two founding financial companies.

The S&P Dow Jones Indices owns it as of 2022 and that\\'s a joint venture between S&P Global (formerly) McGraw Hill Financial, CME Group, and News Corp, the owner of Dow Jones. It tracks 500 publicly traded, large-cap U.S. companies. These businesses must meet specific criteria to be a part of the S&P 500. The mix of industries that make up the S&P 500 list often reflects the economic makeup of the United States. The S&P 500 tracks the market capitalization of the companies in its index. Market cap is the total value of all shares of stock that a company has issued. It\\'s calculated by multiplying the number of shares issued by the stock price. A company that has a market cap of $100 billion receives 10 times the representation as a company whose market cap is $10 billion. It represents the stock market\\'s performance by reporting the risks and returns of the biggest companies. Investors use it as the benchmark of the overall market, to which all other investments are compared.

But the limited history of Apple stock splits says there is no reason to rush in to buy the lower-priced shares. Two weeks after the previous stock splits, shares of Apple have lost an average of 5.6%, trading negatively in all four instances, according to data from hedge fund trading information platform Kensho. That underperforms the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tends to be a coin flip in these post-Apple stock split weeks. The company\\'s fifth stock split could encourage new investors to buy, but Apple\\'s trading history offers a warning. ... Apple is having a great year, and its 4-for-1 stock split on Monday is expected to make the market\\'s most-valuable company even more attractive to a wider universe of retail investors. But the limited history of Apple stock splits says there is no reason to rush in to buy the lower-priced shares. The technology giant has been on fire. Apple became the first company to reach a $2 trillion market cap earlier in August, and it eclipsed a $500 price per share.

On Feb. 28, 2005, Apple split its stock again when it hit $88.99. These last two were also two-for-one splits. The company split its stock again on a seven-to-one basis on June 9, 2014, when share prices reached $645.57. In general, the accepted purpose for a stock split is that it could result in, for example, Apple stock being a more accessible and attractive purchase for individual investors who may not have as much to spend as other investors. A sixth Apple stock split could motivate individual investors and traders to put more money into Apple stock. Apple\\'s stock has split five times since its initial public offering.

[Active fixed income team](#active-fixed-income-team)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVanguard Active Fixed Income perspectives is our quarterly in-depth commentary. It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance:**\\xa0In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe descent from Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index (core PCE), to fall steadily and end the year just above the Fe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...(truncated)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.2702,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"aee80084\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"aee80084-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/aee80084.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc.

It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance:**\\xa0In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe descent from Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index (core PCE), to fall steadily and end the year just above the Fe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...(truncated)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -4.037,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"01525ba7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"01525ba7-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/01525ba7.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Q1 2024 Corporate Bond Market Outlook | Breckinridge Capital Advisors\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Q1 2024 Corporate Bond Market Outlook | Breckinridge Capital Advisors\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nwindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\\\\\\\\nfunction gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\\\\\\\\ngtag(\\'js\\', new Date());\\\\\\\\ngtag(\\'config\\', \\'G-JY32R54HK2\\');\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(function() {\\\\\\\\nvar didInit = false;\\\\\\\\nfunction initMunchkin() {\\\\\\\\nif(didInit === false) {\\\\\\\\ndidInit = true;\\\\\\\\nMunchkin.init(\\'200-OYK-473\\');\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\nvar s = document.createElement(\\'script\\');\\\\\\\\ns.type = \\'text/javascript\\';\\\\\\\\ns.async = true;\\\\\\\\ns.src = \\'//munchkin.marketo.net/munchkin.js\\';\\\\\\\\ns.onreadystatechange = function() {\\\\\\\\nif (this.readyState == \\'complete\\' || this.readyState == \\'loaded\\') {\\\\\\\\ninitMunchkin();\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n};\\\\\\\\ns.onload = initMunchkin;\\\\\\\\ndocument.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\')[0].appendChild(s);\\\\\\\\n})();\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe content on this website is intended for investment professionals and institutional asset owners.

Value stocks are classified as companies that are currently trading below what they are really worth and will thus provide a superior return. Value stocks are classified as companies that are currently trading below what they are really worth and will thus provide a superior return. Which category is better? The comparative historical performance of these two sub-sectors yields some surprising results. Value stocks are usually larger, more well-established companies that trade below the price that analysts feel the stock is worth, depending upon the financial ratio or benchmark used as a comparison. For example, the book value of a company’s stock may be $25 a share based on the number of shares outstanding divided by the company’s capitalization. For example, the book value of a company’s stock may be $25 a share based on the number of shares outstanding divided by the company’s capitalization. Therefore, if it trades for $20 a share at the moment, then many analysts would consider this to be a good value play.\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Companies within the sector provide a variety of clean energy including solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. The largest renewable energy companies are headquartered in Spain and Denmark, but other big players are based in China, the U.S., and Canada. These are the 10 biggest renewable energy companies by 12-month trailing (TTM) revenue. Some companies outside the U.S. report profits semi-annually, so the 12-month trailing data may be older than it is for companies that report quarterly. This list is limited to companies that are publicly traded in the U.S. or Canada, either directly or through ADRs. GE operates in multiple industries, including health care and aviation.

According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, these 5 tech stocks were responsible for more than 20% of the S&P 500’s 31% return in 2019. When you see a handful of stocks dominate in such a way it can make some investors nervous. What happens to the stock market if these companies begin to sell off? Is the rest of the market participating in this rally or is it all being driven by just a small number of stocks? One of the things that jumps out from this list is how high the turnover at the top can be. Every decade there were at least five to six new names at the top of the list. While technology firms dominate the top slots today, in the early-1980s it was energy companies. The behemoth tech stocks have taken advantage of these trends but it was not preordained that these companies would be where they are today. Apple was rescued by Microsoft with a $150 million loan in 1997 which was one year before Google was founded.

The mix of industries that make up the S&P 500 list often reflects the economic makeup of the United States. The S&P 500 tracks the market capitalization of the companies in its index. Market cap is the total value of all shares of stock that a company has issued. It\\'s calculated by multiplying the number of shares issued by the stock price. A company that has a market cap of $100 billion receives 10 times the representation as a company whose market cap is $10 billion. It represents the stock market\\'s performance by reporting the risks and returns of the biggest companies. Investors use it as the benchmark of the overall market, to which all other investments are compared.

Some companies outside the U.S. report profits semi-annually, so the 12-month trailing data may be older than it is for companies that report quarterly.

This massive growth also means these companies now have an outsized impact on the performance of the market itself. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, these 5 tech stocks were responsible for more than 20% of the S&P 500’s 31% return in 2019. When you see a handful of stocks dominate in such a way it can make some investors nervous. What happens to the stock market if these companies begin to sell off? Is the rest of the market participating in this rally or is it all being driven by just a small number of stocks? One of the things that jumps out from this list is how high the turnover at the top can be. Every decade there were at least five to six new names at the top of the list. While technology firms dominate the top slots today, in the early-1980s it was energy companies. The behemoth tech stocks have taken advantage of these trends but it was not preordained that these companies would be where they are today. Apple was rescued by Microsoft with a $150 million loan in 1997 which was one year before Google was founded. Jeff Bezos started Amazon in a garage in 1994.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.4823,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5d81e62b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

That’s according to Wall Street analysts including Kaumil Gajrawala at Jefferies, who has initiated coverage of PepsiCo with a buy rating, calling it the sector’s “most durable business.” He projects the shares will rise more than 20% over the next year to $203, for a market value of about $279 billion. That would top the roughly $277 billion market capitalization implied by his $64 target for Coca-Cola, which he rates a hold. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is exclusively a beverage company. For PepsiCo, “hefty investments over the last half decade are yielding results, and we expect returns to accelerate,” Gajrawala wrote in a note to clients, highlighting that the company has invested about $60 billion over the past five years to make operations more efficient, increase capacity and build its brand. The call, echoed by analysts from Cowen and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., would mark a telling reversal for the soda giants: Aside from a single day in 2020, PepsiCo’s value hasn’t eclipsed Coca-Cola’s since 2006. At roughly $246 billion on Monday, Coca-Cola’s market cap is nearly $15 billion above PepsiCo’s. Coca-Cola has long held down the top spot in part due to its strong brand portfolio and record of sales growth. But PepsiCo’s food business, including Lay’s potato chips, Doritos and Quaker oatmeal, has become a key differentiator. Gajrawala expects PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay North America business will continue to outperform its other products.

The adjusted closing price accounts for any distribution that affects the price.For example, let\\'s assume that the closing price for one share of XYZ Corp. is $20 on Thursday. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). These distributions may include cash dividends, stock dividends, or stock splits. The adjusted closing price is often used when examining historical returns or performing a detailed analysis of historical returns. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). If XYZ Corp. announces a 2:1 stock dividend instead of a cash dividend, the adjusted closing price calculation will change. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. For cash dividends, the value of the dividend is deducted from the last closing sale price of the stock.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.8927,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

[Active fixed income team](#active-fixed-income-team)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVanguard Active Fixed Income perspectives is our quarterly in-depth commentary. It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance:**\\xa0In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe descent from Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index (core PCE), to fall steadily and end the year just above the Fe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...(truncated)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.5686,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"01525ba7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"01525ba7-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 1,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/01525ba7.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Q1 2024 Corporate Bond Market Outlook | Breckinridge Capital Advisors\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"[Breckinridge Capital Advisors](https://www.breckinridge.com/) > Additional Navigation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"[Company](https://www.breckinridge.com/company/)\\\\\\\\nExpand Navigation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[About Us](https://www.breckinridge.com/company/about-us/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Company News](https://www.breckinridge.com/company/company-news/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Press Coverage](https://www.breckinridge.com/company/press/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Sustainability Initiatives](https://www.breckinridge.com/company/sustainability-initiatives/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Our Clients](https://www.breckinridge.com/company/clients/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Contact Us](https://www.breckinridge.com/company/contact-us/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Investments](https://www.breckinridge.com/investments/)\\\\\\\\nExpand Navigation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Approach](https://www.breckinridge.com/investments/approach/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Strategies](https://www.breckinridge.com/investments/strategies/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[People](https://www.breckinridge.com/people/)\\\\\\\\nExpand Navigation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Directory](https://www.breckinridge.com/people/directory/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Culture & Careers](https://www.breckinridge.com/people/culture-careers/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Insights](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/)\\\\\\\\nExpand Navigation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Commentaries](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/?type=commentary)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Perspectives](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/?type=perspective)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[ESG Newsletter](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/?type=esg-newsletter)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Subscribe](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/subscribe/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Disclosures](https://www.breckinridge.com/terms-amp-conditions/)\\\\\\\\nExpand Navigation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Form ADV](https://www.breckinridge.com/uploads/2023-breckinridge-form-adv-part-2a.pdf)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Form CRS](https://www.breckinridge.com/uploads/2023-breckinridge-form-crs.pdf)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Advisor Login](https://portal.breckinridge.com/Advisor/)\\\\\\\\n[Search](https://www.breckinridge.com/search/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMenu\\\\\\\\nSearch\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Commentaries](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/?type=commentary)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Perspectives](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/?type=perspective)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[ESG Newsletter](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/?type=esg-newsletter)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Subscribe](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/subscribe/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[Back to Insights](https://www.breckinridge.com/insights/)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.8766,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ea79f896\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ea79f896-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/ea79f896.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Active Fixed Income Perspectives Q1 2024: Yield Mountain\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Active Fixed Income Perspectives Q1 2024: Yield Mountain\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Active Fixed Income Perspectives Q1 2024: Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nvar host = document.location.hostname,\\\\\\\\nscriptSource = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"advisors.vanguard.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\" === host ||\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"fasi.vanguard.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\" === host ||\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"www.vanguardadvisorsolutions.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\" === host\\\\\\\\n?

Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\n    68→\\n    69→**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\n    70→\\n    71→**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\n    72→\\n    73→The descent from Yield Mountain\\n    74→\\n    75→## **The descent from Yield Mountain**\\n    76→\\n    77→Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world.

[Active fixed income team](#active-fixed-income-team)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVanguard Active Fixed Income perspectives is our quarterly in-depth commentary. It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance:**\\xa0In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe descent from Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Inflation, as

It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance:**\\xa0In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe descent from Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index (core PCE), to fall steadily and end the year just above the Fe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...(truncated)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.1419,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ea79f896\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ea79f896-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/ea79f896.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Active Fixed Income Perspectives Q1 2024: Yield Mountain\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Active Fixed Income Perspectives Q1 2024: Yield Mountain\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Active Fixed Income Perspectives Q1 2024: Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nvar host = document.location.hostname,\\\\\\\\nscriptSource = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"advisors.vanguard.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\" === host ||\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"fasi.vanguard.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\" === host ||\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"www.vanguardadvisorsolutions.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\" === host\\\\\\\\n?

This comparison helps you understand whether markets are overvaluing or undervaluing a stock. The P/E ratio is a key tool to help you compare the valuations of individual stocks or entire stock indexes, such as the S&P 500. The P/E ratio is derived by dividing the price of a stock by the stock’s earnings. Think of it this way: The market price of a stock tells you how much people are willing to pay to own the shares, but the P/E ratio tells you whether the price accurately reflects the company’s earnings potential, or it’s value over time. In addition to stocks, the P/E ratio is calculated for entire stock indexes. For example, the P/E ratio of the NIFTY 50 currently stands at 22.20 . Since prices fluctuate constantly, the P/E ratio of stocks and stock indexes never stand still. The P/E ratio also changes as companies report earnings, typically on a quarterly basis. The price-to-earnings ratio is most commonly calculated using the current price of a stock, although one can use an average price over a set period of time. When it comes to the earnings part of the calculation, however, there are three varying approaches to the P/E ratio, each of which tell you different things about a stock.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -4.5287,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8a79fadb\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8a79fadb-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/8a79fadb.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio Formula and How to Interpret It\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio Formula and How to Interpret It\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio indicates how much debt a company is using to finance its assets relative to the value of shareholders’ equity.The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate a company’s financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. The D/E ratio is an important metric in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. These balance sheet categories may include items that would not normally be considered debt or equity in the traditional sense of a loan or an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by retained earnings or losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand to what extent a company relies on debt. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of gearing ratio. The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio compares a company’s total liabilities with its shareholder equity and can be used to assess the extent of its reliance on debt. Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as the D/E ratio and the debt ratio. Or you could enter the values for total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in adjacent spreadsheet cells, say B2 and B3, then add the formula “=B2/B3” in cell B4 to obtain the D/E ratio.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.51,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d4494e4f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d4494e4f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/d4494e4f.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? - Forage\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? - Forage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@context\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://schema.org\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@graph\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@type\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#article\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"isPartOf\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"author\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"McKayla Girardin\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/#/schema/person/c3cfebc1817968bc8248e9b1138fb08e\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio?\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"datePublished\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-10-20T14:00:00-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"dateModified\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2023-03-17T14:20:31-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mainEntityOfPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"wordCount\\\\\\\\\\\\\":1316,\\\\\\\\\\\\\"publisher\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/#organization\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#primaryimage\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thumbnailUrl\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pe-ratio.png\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"articleSection\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Skills\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\\\\\\"inLanguage\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"en-US\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@type\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"WebPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? - Forage\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"isPartOf\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/#website\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"primaryImageOfPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#primaryimage\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#primaryimage\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thumbnailUrl\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pe-ratio.png\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"datePublished\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-10-20T14:00:00-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"dateModified\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2023-03-17T14:20:31-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The P/E ratio is a comparison of a company\\'s share price to its annual earnings.

See why I would currently choose MA stock over V stock.While Mastercard has shown a Revenue Growth 5 Year [CAGR] of 12.22%, Visa’s is 9.98%. The same is shown when taking a closer look at the EBIT Growth 3 Year [CAGR]: while Mastercard’s is 9.30%, Visa’s is 8.81%. Particularly due to Mastercard’s slightly higher Growth Rates in combination with the results of my DCF Model (which indicates an Internal Rate of Return of 12% for Mastercard and 10% for Visa), I currently rate Mastercard as a strong buy while Visa receives my buy rating. Let’s now take a look at the companies’ P/E [FWD] Ratio in order to see which is the more attractive in terms of Valuation: Visa’s P/E [FWD] Ratio of 27.33 is slightly below that of Mastercard (P/E [FWD] Ratio of 29.73). In my opinion, the slightly higher P/E [FWD] Ratio of Mastercard in comparison to Visa can be justified with Mastercard’s Growth Rates being above its competitor. When having a closer look at the companies’ Dividend, we find that Visa currently pays the slightly higher Dividend Yield [FWD] when compared to Mastercard: at this moment in time, Visa’s Dividend Yield [FWD] is 0.80% while Mastercard’s is 0.63%. While Visa’s Total Return has been 92.34% over the last 5 years, Mastercard’s has been 110.38% (the S&P 500 has shown a Total Return of 48.40%). In this comparative analysis, I will show you which of the companies is the lower-risk investment and which offers the higher reward. ...

Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comprised 95%, or 295,324, of deliveries in the period ending March 31, 2022. In its energy segment, Tesla\\'s solar deployments dropped by nearly half to 48 MW in the first quarter of 2022 versus the same time last year. The company deployed 846 MWh of lithium ion based battery energy storage systems, up 90% from the same time last year, but down from the previous quarter. The company said declines in solar deployments were caused by import delays on certain components that were beyond Tesla\\'s control. Amid inflationary pressures, parts and semiconductor chip shortages exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic and Russia\\'s brutal invasion of Ukraine, Tesla global vehicle inventory dwindled to a three-day supply in the first quarter of 2022. That\\'s down from a four-day supply of global vehicle inventory in the previous quarter, and eight-day supply during the first quarter of 2021. \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Tesla said in its shareholder deck. Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. ... Tesla just reported first-quarter earnings for 2022 and beat analysts\\' expectations on the top and bottom lines.

In a shareholder deck, the company acknowledged that average sales prices have \"generally been on a downward trajectory for many years,\" and said \"affordability\" would be necessary for Tesla to grow into a company that sells multiple millions of cars annually. In late 2022 and this year, Tesla cut prices on its cars around the world, upsetting customers in the U.S. and China who recently bought new Teslas at higher prices, and triggering an instant decline in used Tesla prices in the U.S. as well. Shareholders asked a question about how Musk plans to safeguard Tesla\\'s brand and reputation from any backlash resulting from his political statements, and new job as the CEO of Twitter, the social media company he acquired in October 2022. Musk replied by promoting Twitter as a great way to connect with customers: Automotive revenue amounted to $21.3 billion in the three months ending 2022, and included $324 million of deferred revenue related to the company\\'s driver assistance systems. Automotive gross margins came in at 25.9%, the lowest figure in the last five quarters. ...

That’s according to Wall Street analysts including Kaumil Gajrawala at Jefferies, who has initiated coverage of PepsiCo with a buy rating, calling it the sector’s “most durable business.” He projects the shares will rise more than 20% over the next year to $203, for a market value of about $279 billion. That would top the roughly $277 billion market capitalization implied by his $64 target for Coca-Cola, which he rates a hold. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is exclusively a beverage company. For PepsiCo, “hefty investments over the last half decade are yielding results, and we expect returns to accelerate,” Gajrawala wrote in a note to clients, highlighting that the company has invested about $60 billion over the past five years to make operations more efficient, increase capacity and build its brand. The call, echoed by analysts from Cowen and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., would mark a telling reversal for the soda giants: Aside from a single day in 2020, PepsiCo’s value hasn’t eclipsed Coca-Cola’s since 2006. At roughly $246 billion on Monday, Coca-Cola’s market cap is nearly $15 billion above PepsiCo’s. Coca-Cola has long held down the top spot in part due to its strong brand portfolio and record of sales growth. But PepsiCo’s food business, including Lay’s potato chips, Doritos and Quaker oatmeal, has become a key differentiator. Gajrawala expects PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay North America business will continue to outperform its other products. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is exclusively a beverage company.\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

This average is useful for determining which stocks are suitable for certain investors.Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume equates to how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors. Average daily trading volume is a commonly used metric and is useful for determining if a stock meets an investor\\'s or trader\\'s trade parameters. ADTV is an average, though. On any given day an asset can deviate from the average, producing much higher or lower volume. Then divide the total by X. For example, add the last 20 days of trading volume and divide by 20 to get the 20-day ADTV. Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This sentiment could be bearish or bullish, depending on the price direction. Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well. Traders and investors alike pay close attention to ADTV because it provides valuable information about the liquidity and market interest in a particular security. Risk was also managed by using the trading limit along with the ADTV crossover, allowing the stock trader to easily exit the position. This example was for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell GE stock. Also, the criteria for trading limits as well as ADTV are purely for illustration. Volume is sometimes confused with open interest. Average daily trading volume is the average of how many shares (stock market) or contracts (futures and options market) change hands in a day.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -4.3994,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4a1c8e19\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4a1c8e19-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/4a1c8e19.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Volume is a simple yet powerful way for traders and investors to increase profits and minimize risks.At a market bottom, falling prices eventually force out large numbers of traders, resulting in volatility and increased volume. We will see a decrease in volume after the spike in these situations, but how volume continues to play out over the next days, weeks, and months can be analyzed by using the other volume guidelines. Daily volume is the most common time frame used when discussing stock volume. Average daily trading volume is the daily volume of shares traded, averaged over a number of days; this smooths out days when trading volume is unusually low or high.

Trading volume is a technical indicator because it represents the overall activity of a security or a market. Investors often use trading volume to confirm the existence or continuation of a trend, or a trend reversal. Trading volume is defined as the number of shares traded in a particular period of time. So, low trading volume can indicate a lack of interest in either buying or selling. That means it could be bullish if low volume occurs in a downtrend. It could be bearish if it\\'s noted in an uptrend. Trading volume is one of the metrics that traders watch to predict the momentum of a stock or other security.

Average daily trading volume is a commonly used metric and is useful for determining if a stock meets an investor\\'s or trader\\'s trade parameters. ADTV is an average, though. On any given day an asset can deviate from the average, producing much higher or lower volume. Then divide the total by X. For example, add the last 20 days of trading volume and divide by 20 to get the 20-day ADTV. Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This sentiment could be bearish or bullish, depending on the price direction. Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well. Traders and investors alike pay close attention to ADTV because it provides valuable information about the liquidity and market interest in a particular security. Risk was also managed by using the trading limit along with the ADTV crossover, allowing the stock trader to easily exit the position. This example was for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell GE stock. Also, the criteria for trading limits as well as ADTV are purely for illustration. Volume is sometimes confused with open interest. Average daily trading volume is the average of how many shares (stock market) or contracts (futures and options market) change hands in a day.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.0876,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4a1c8e19\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4a1c8e19-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/4a1c8e19.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Volume is a simple yet powerful way for traders and investors to increase profits and minimize risks.At a market bottom, falling prices eventually force out large numbers of traders, resulting in volatility and increased volume. We will see a decrease in volume after the spike in these situations, but how volume continues to play out over the next days, weeks, and months can be analyzed by using the other volume guidelines. Daily volume is the most common time frame used when discussing stock volume. Average daily trading volume is the daily volume of shares traded, averaged over a number of days; this smooths out days when trading volume is unusually low or high.

In the 21st century the manufacturing sector in Central and Eastern Europe picked up because of the accession of ten formerly Communist European states to the EU and their resulting accession to the European Common Market. In the 21st century the manufacturing sector in Central and Eastern Europe picked up because of the accession of ten formerly Communist European states to the EU and their resulting accession to the European Common Market. This caused firms within the European Union to move jobs from their manufacturing sector to Central European countries such as Poland (see above), which sparked both Central and Eastern European industrial growth and employment. 63% of large firms, 61% of infrastructure firms and 58% of firms in the service sector are the largest share expecting long term effects of COVID-19. Across the European Union, the most commonly mentioned investment barrier is the lack of trained labor. 75% of businesses in transitional regions found this to be problematic. In less developed and non-cohesion regions, it is 79%. Demographics and rising demand for skills that are less common on the market, such as those needed to support digitalization activities, might contribute to the lack of competent workers. European businesses have been in decline against worldwide ones since the crisis. Of the 50 most valuable global firms, only seven were European as of 2015, compared to 17 in 2006. Out of 24 economic sectors, Europe only leads in one - food, which is led by Nestlé from Switzerland. Europe\\'s agricultural sector is in general highly developed and also has the lowest percentage of the population working in agriculture of any continent. The process of improving Central Europe\\'s agriculture is ongoing and is helped by the accession of Central European states to the EU.\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Companies within the sector provide a variety of clean energy including solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. The largest renewable energy companies are headquartered in Spain and Denmark, but other big players are based in China, the U.S., and Canada.

Some companies outside the U.S. report profits semi-annually, so the 12-month trailing data may be older than it is for companies that report quarterly. This list is limited to companies that are publicly traded in the U.S. or Canada, either directly or through ADRs. GE operates in multiple industries, including health care and aviation.

[Active fixed income team](#active-fixed-income-team)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVanguard Active Fixed Income perspectives is our quarterly in-depth commentary. It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance:**\\xa0In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe descent from Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index (core PCE), to fall steadily and end the year just above the Fe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...(truncated)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n

Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade.

This average is useful for determining which stocks are suitable for certain investors.Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume equates to how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors. Average daily trading volume is a commonly used metric and is useful for determining if a stock meets an investor\\'s or trader\\'s trade parameters. ADTV is an average, though. On any given day an asset can deviate from the average, producing much higher or lower volume. Then divide the total by X. For example, add the last 20 days of trading volume and divide by 20 to get the 20-day ADTV. Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This sentiment could be bearish or bullish, depending on the price direction. Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well. Traders and investors alike pay close attention to ADTV because it provides valuable information about the liquidity and market interest in a particular security. Risk was also managed by using the trading limit along with the ADTV crossover, allowing the stock trader to easily exit the position. This example was for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell GE stock. Also, the criteria for trading limits as well as ADTV are purely for illustration. Volume is sometimes confused with open interest. Average daily trading volume is the average of how many shares (stock market) or contracts (futures and options market) change hands in a day.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.9884,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a54493c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a54493c-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/0a54493c.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc - ADR Shares Close the Day 11.0% Higher - Daily Wrap ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc - ADR Shares Close the Day 11.0% Higher - Daily Wrap ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc - ADR (XPEV) shares closed today 11.0% higher than it did at the end of yesterday.

Sure, Coca-Cola’s net income margin has increased consistently over recent years, but the one key element is the revenue. PepsiCo’s revenue base has been almost double that of Coca-Cola. Additionally, while PepsiCo’s revenues have steadily increased during the 2016-2019 period, Coca-Cola’s revenues have declined during this period due to refranchising of its bottling operations (franchise owners record revenues from bottling plants they own, while Coca-Cola earns fees from franchisees), with some revenue growth coming only in FY2019 with most refranchising already done.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.8881,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5be88f73\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5be88f73-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/5be88f73.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Eli Lilly and Stock Price | LLY Stock Quote, News, and History ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Eli Lilly and Stock Price | LLY Stock Quote, News, and History ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The latest Eli Lilly and stock prices, stock quotes, news, and LLY history to help you invest and trade smarter.Eli Lilly and stock has received a consensus rating of buy.

Additionally, while PepsiCo’s revenues have steadily increased during the 2016-2019 period, Coca-Cola’s revenues have declined during this period due to refranchising of its bottling operations (franchise owners record revenues from bottling plants they own, while Coca-Cola earns fees from franchisees), with some revenue growth coming only in FY2019 with most refranchising already done.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.7727,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3037a091\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3037a091-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/3037a091.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Arrow Financial Corporation (AROW) Stock Price, Quote & News -

Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade. Based upon this analysis, they implement trading strategies and capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n[SEARCH NOTE] 以上为文档片段（chunks），可能不完整。如果 chunk 内容不足以完整回答问题（缺少具体步骤、命令、配置、代码），请用 Read(path) 读取对应文件获取完整上下文，严禁用通用知识补充。\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='call_4559f9e7a6ed428fa2806e4e', content='{\"result\":\"[]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ThinkingBlock(thinking='根据检索结果，我找到了关于 CURO Group Holdings (NYSE: CURO) 的股票价格信息。让我分析这些文档：\\n\\n1. 第一个结果 (docs/crag-finance/42480b7e.md) 显示：\\n   - CURO 股票价格为 **$4.23** 每股\\n   - 市值约 $171.25M\\n   - 流通股 40,485,381 股\\n\\n2. 第二个结果 (docs/crag-finance/8c9cde5e.md) 显示：\\n   - 最后价格为 **$1.24**\\n   - 52周低点: $1.00\\n   - 52周高点: $6.10\\n   - 根据\"当前价格\"，距离52周低点上涨了124%\\n\\n这里存在数据不一致的问题 - 两个文档显示的价格不同（$4.23 vs $1.24）。这可能是因为数据来源不同或时间点不同。\\n\\n关键问题是：用户问的是 \"today\\'s\"（今天）的股票价格。知识库中的数据是历史快照，不是实时数据。我无法提供\"今天\"的实时股价。\\n\\n我应该：\\n1. 明确告知用户知识库中的数据是历史数据，不是实时数据\\n2. 提供知识库中记录的股价信息，并注明来源\\n3. 建议用户查看实时金融数据源获取最新价格\\n\\n让我基于文档内容回答，严格遵守 Hard Grounding 规则。', signature='1771512437935')]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='## CURO Group Holdings (NYSE: CURO) 股价信息\\n\\n⚠️ **重要说明**：知识库中的数据是历史快照，**不是实时股价**。我无法提供\"今天\"的最新股价。\\n\\n---\\n\\n根据知识库文档记录的股价信息：\\n\\n| 来源 | 记录价格 | 相关信息 |\\n|------|----------|----------|\\n| [来源: docs/crag-finance/42480b7e.md] | **$4.23** | 市值 $171.25M，流通股 40,485,381 股 |\\n| [来源: docs/crag-finance/8c9cde5e.md] | **$1.24** | 52周区间: $1.00 - $6.10 |\\n\\n### 文档中的其他信息：\\n- 原始上市价格: $14.20 (2017年12月7日) [来源: docs/crag-finance/42480b7e.md]\\n- 5年总回报率: -70.21% (年化回报 -21.51%) [来源: docs/crag-finance/42480b7e.md]\\n- 分析师预测中位目标价: $13.13 (9位分析师) [来源: docs/crag-finance/8c9cde5e.md]\\n\\n---\\n\\n**获取今日实时股价，请访问**：\\n- [Nasdaq CURO Quote](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/curo)\\n- 或其他实时金融数据平台')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "## CURO Group Holdings (NYSE: CURO) 股价信息\n\n⚠️ **重要说明**：知识库中的数据是历史快照，**不是实时股价**。我无法提供\"今天\"的最新股价。\n\n---\n\n根据知识库文档记录的股价信息：\n\n| 来源 | 记录价格 | 相关信息 |\n|------|----------|----------|\n| [来源: docs/crag-finance/42480b7e.md] | **$4.23** | 市值 $171.25M，流通股 40,485,381 股 |\n| [来源: docs/crag-finance/8c9cde5e.md] | **$1.24** | 52周区间: $1.00 - $6.10 |\n\n### 文档中的其他信息：\n- 原始上市价格: $14.20 (2017年12月7日) [来源: docs/crag-finance/42480b7e.md]\n- 5年总回报率: -70.21% (年化回报 -21.51%) [来源: docs/crag-finance/42480b7e.md]\n- 分析师预测中位目标价: $13.13 (9位分析师) [来源: docs/crag-finance/8c9cde5e.md]\n\n---\n\n**获取今日实时股价，请访问**：\n- [Nasdaq CURO Quote](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/curo)\n- 或其他实时金融数据平台", "session_id": "758db794-3608-4a0f-b681-8a46c3c5dd03", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 378089, "total_cost_usd": 0.110301, "usage": {"input_tokens": 16945, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 9152, "output_tokens": 840, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

There is a maximum amount of credit that a card can provide, called a credit limit, which should not be surpassed. Exceeding the limit may require the credit card holder to pay a credit limit fee. At the end of the month, the credit card holder can choose to repay the entire amount or leave an unpaid balance that is subject to interest until it is paid off. Note that credit card interest rates tend to be relatively high compared to other common loans such as mortgages, car loans, or student loans, and as such, the balance should ideally be paid off monthly to avoid paying large amounts of interest. Examples of credit card issuers include banks, credit unions, or retailers, and examples of credit card networks include Visa or MasterCard. American Express and Discover are both issuers and networks. Networks charge a small fee (<3%) for handling the processing of the transactions. Issuers profit from interest payments on revolving balances, late fees, annual membership fees, fees for cash withdrawals, interchange fees, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**APR**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDifferent cards offer varying rates of interest, often referred to as the annual percentage rate, or APR. Some cards have variable APRs, based on specific indexes, and others have fixed APRs. There are some credit cards that are specifically advertised as having a zero, introductory, annual percentage rate (APR).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Cash Advances**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to withdraw credit from a credit card for physical cash. This is called a cash advance, and they usually have very high APRs. There is no grace period as interest accumulates immediately, cash advances don\\'t count towards rewards, and there is usually a cash advance fee. On top of that, the ATM used will probably also charge a fee. Normally, credit card cash advances are not very advantageous, and should generally be reserved for emergencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Balance Transfers**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to transfer the balance from one credit card to another. People who carry revolving credit month-to-month can probably consider applying for a favorable balance-transfer credit card, usually in the form of one with a low or zero introductory rate.

Calculate a Stock\\'s Adjusted Closing Price\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When the day&#x27;s trading is done, all stocks are priced at close. The adjusted closing price accounts for any distribution that affects the price.For example, let\\'s assume that the closing price for one share of XYZ Corp. is $20 on Thursday. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). These distributions may include cash dividends, stock dividends, or stock splits. The adjusted closing price is often used when examining historical returns or performing a detailed analysis of historical returns. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). If XYZ Corp. announces a 2:1 stock dividend instead of a cash dividend, the adjusted closing price calculation will change. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. For cash dividends, the value of the dividend is deducted from the last closing sale price of the stock.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.417,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5cf16a1b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5cf16a1b-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/5cf16a1b.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Top 30 Companies of Dow Jones Index by Weight in 2023\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"var \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_ez\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_ab\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_test = \\'mod1\\'\\\\\\\\nvar \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_ezHttpConsent={setByCat:function(src,tagType,attributes,category,force){var setScript=function(){if(force||window.ezTcfConsent[category]){var scriptElement=document.createElement(tagType);scriptElement.src=src;attributes.forEach(function(attr){for(var key in attr){if(attr.hasOwnProperty(key)){scriptElement.setAttribute(key,attr[key]);}}});var firstScript=document.getElementsByTagName(tagType)[0];firstScript.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement,firstScript);}};if(force||(window.ezTcfConsent&&window.ezTcfConsent.loaded)){setScript();}else if(typeof getEzConsentData===\\\\\\\\\\\\\"function\\\\\\\\\\\\\"){getEzConsentData().then(function(ezTcfConsent){if(ezTcfConsent&&ezTcfConsent.loaded){setScript();}else{console.error(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"cannot get ez consent data\\\\\\\\\\\\\");force=true;setScript();}});}else{force=true;setScript();console.error(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"getEzConsentData is not a function\\\\\\\\\\\\\");}},};\\\\\\\\nvar ezTcfConsent=window.ezTcfConsent?window.ezTcfConsent:{loaded:false,store\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_info:false,develop\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_and\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_improve\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_services:false,measure\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_ad\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_performance:false,measure\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_performance:false,select\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_basic\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_ads:false,create\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_ad\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_profile:false,select\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_personalized\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_ads:false,create\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_content\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_profile:false,select\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_personalized\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_content:false,understand\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_audiences:false,use\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_limited\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_data\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_to\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_select\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_content:false,};function getEzConsentData(){return new Promise(function(resolve){document.addEventListener(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ezConsentEvent\\\\\\\\\\\\\",function(event){var ezTcfConsent=event.detail.ezTcfConsent;resolve(ezTcfConsent);});});}\\\\\\\\nfunction \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_setEzCookies(ezConsentData){var cookies=[{name:\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ezoadgid\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_206329\\\\\\\\\\\\\",value:\\\\\\\\\\\\\"-1;

The adjusted closing price accounts for any distribution that affects the price.For example, let\\'s assume that the closing price for one share of XYZ Corp. is $20 on Thursday. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). These distributions may include cash dividends, stock dividends, or stock splits. The adjusted closing price is often used when examining historical returns or performing a detailed analysis of historical returns. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). If XYZ Corp. announces a 2:1 stock dividend instead of a cash dividend, the adjusted closing price calculation will change. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. For cash dividends, the value of the dividend is deducted from the last closing sale price of the stock.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.6635,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"45fb8198\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"45fb8198-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/45fb8198.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Crawford & Company B (CRD.B) Stock Dividend Date & History -

See why I would currently choose MA stock over V stock.While Mastercard has shown a Revenue Growth 5 Year [CAGR] of 12.22%, Visa’s is 9.98%. The same is shown when taking a closer look at the EBIT Growth 3 Year [CAGR]: while Mastercard’s is 9.30%, Visa’s is 8.81%. Particularly due to Mastercard’s slightly higher Growth Rates in combination with the results of my DCF Model (which indicates an Internal Rate of Return of 12% for Mastercard and 10% for Visa), I currently rate Mastercard as a strong buy while Visa receives my buy rating. Let’s now take a look at the companies’ P/E [FWD] Ratio in order to see which is the more attractive in terms of Valuation: Visa’s P/E [FWD] Ratio of 27.33 is slightly below that of Mastercard (P/E [FWD] Ratio of 29.73). In my opinion, the slightly higher P/E [FWD] Ratio of Mastercard in comparison to Visa can be justified with Mastercard’s Growth Rates being above its competitor. When having a closer look at the companies’ Dividend, we find that Visa currently pays the slightly higher Dividend Yield [FWD] when compared to Mastercard: at this moment in time, Visa’s Dividend Yield [FWD] is 0.80% while Mastercard’s is 0.63%. While Visa’s Total Return has been 92.34% over the last 5 years, Mastercard’s has been 110.38% (the S&P 500 has shown a Total Return of 48.40%). In this comparative analysis, I will show you which of the companies is the lower-risk investment and which offers the higher reward. ... In my opinion, both Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) provide (dividend growth) investors with excellent chances when it comes to risk and reward.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -8.3888,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"af7a2d0c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"af7a2d0c-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/af7a2d0c.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Royalty Management Holding (Nasdaq:RMCO) - Stock Price, News & ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Royalty Management Holding (Nasdaq:RMCO) - Stock Price, News & ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Research Royalty Management Holding&#x27;s (Nasdaq:RMCO) stock price, latest news &amp; stock analysis.

There is a maximum amount of credit that a card can provide, called a credit limit, which should not be surpassed. Exceeding the limit may require the credit card holder to pay a credit limit fee. At the end of the month, the credit card holder can choose to repay the entire amount or leave an unpaid balance that is subject to interest until it is paid off. Note that credit card interest rates tend to be relatively high compared to other common loans such as mortgages, car loans, or student loans, and as such, the balance should ideally be paid off monthly to avoid paying large amounts of interest. Examples of credit card issuers include banks, credit unions, or retailers, and examples of credit card networks include Visa or MasterCard. American Express and Discover are both issuers and networks. Networks charge a small fee (<3%) for handling the processing of the transactions. Issuers profit from interest payments on revolving balances, late fees, annual membership fees, fees for cash withdrawals, interchange fees, etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**APR**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDifferent cards offer varying rates of interest, often referred to as the annual percentage rate, or APR. Some cards have variable APRs, based on specific indexes, and others have fixed APRs. There are some credit cards that are specifically advertised as having a zero, introductory, annual percentage rate (APR).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Cash Advances**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to withdraw credit from a credit card for physical cash. This is called a cash advance, and they usually have very high APRs. There is no grace period as interest accumulates immediately, cash advances don\\'t count towards rewards, and there is usually a cash advance fee. On top of that, the ATM used will probably also charge a fee. Normally, credit card cash advances are not very advantageous, and should generally be reserved for emergencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Balance Transfers**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to transfer the balance from one credit card to another. People who carry revolving credit month-to-month can probably consider applying for a favorable balance-transfer credit card, usually in the form of one with a low or zero introductory rate.

Mastercard: Which Is The Better Choice For Investors? ...\\n    11→\\n    12→I consider both Visa and Mastercard to be excellent investment choices when it comes to risk and reward. See why I would currently choose MA stock over V stock.While Mastercard has shown a Revenue Growth 5 Year [CAGR] of 12.22%, Visa’s is 9.98%. The same is shown when taking a closer look at the EBIT Growth 3 Year [CAGR]: while Mastercard’s is 9.30%, Visa’s is 8.81%. Particularly due to Mastercard’s slightly higher Growth Rates in combination with the results of my DCF Model (which indicates an Internal Rate of Return of 12% for Mastercard and 10% for Visa), I currently rate Mastercard as a strong buy while Visa receives my buy rating. Let’s now take a look at the companies’ P/E [FWD] Ratio in order to see which is the more attractive in terms of Valuation: Visa’s P/E [FWD] Ratio of 27.33 is slightly below that of Mastercard (P/E [FWD] Ratio of 29.73). In my opinion, the slightly higher P/E [FWD] Ratio of Mastercard in comparison to Visa can be justified with Mastercard’s Growth Rates being above its competitor. When having a closer look at the companies’ Dividend, we find that Visa currently pays the slightly higher Dividend Yield [FWD] when compared to Mastercard: at this moment in time, Visa’s Dividend Yield [FWD] is 0.80% while Mastercard’s is 0.63%. While Visa’s Total Return has been 92.34% over the last 5 years, Mastercard’s has been 110.38% (the S&P 500 has shown a Total Return of 48.40%). In this comparative analysis, I will show you which of the companies is the lower-risk investment and which offers the higher reward. ... In my opinion, both Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) provide (dividend growth) investors with excellent chances when it comes to risk and reward.\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

This comparison helps you understand whether markets are overvaluing or undervaluing a stock. The P/E ratio is a key tool to help you compare the valuations of indiviThe price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, helps you compare the price of a company’s stock to the earnings the company generates. This comparison helps you understand whether markets are overvaluing or undervaluing a stock. The P/E ratio is a key tool to help you compare the valuations of individual stocks or entire stock indexes, such as the S&P 500. The P/E ratio is derived by dividing the price of a stock by the stock’s earnings. Think of it this way: The market price of a stock tells you how much people are willing to pay to own the shares, but the P/E ratio tells you whether the price accurately reflects the company’s earnings potential, or it’s value over time. In addition to stocks, the P/E ratio is calculated for entire stock indexes. For example, the P/E ratio of the NIFTY 50 currently stands at 22.20 . Since prices fluctuate constantly, the P/E ratio of stocks and stock indexes never stand still. The P/E ratio also changes as companies report earnings, typically on a quarterly basis. The price-to-earnings ratio is most commonly calculated using the current price of a stock, although one can use an average price over a set period of time. When it comes to the earnings part of the calculation, however, there are three varying approaches to the P/E ratio, each of which tell you different things about a stock.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.6858,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d4494e4f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d4494e4f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/d4494e4f.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? - Forage\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? - Forage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@context\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://schema.org\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@graph\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@type\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#article\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"isPartOf\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"author\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"McKayla Girardin\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/#/schema/person/c3cfebc1817968bc8248e9b1138fb08e\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio?\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"datePublished\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-10-20T14:00:00-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"dateModified\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2023-03-17T14:20:31-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mainEntityOfPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"wordCount\\\\\\\\\\\\\":1316,\\\\\\\\\\\\\"publisher\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/#organization\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#primaryimage\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thumbnailUrl\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pe-ratio.png\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"articleSection\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Skills\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\\\\\\"inLanguage\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"en-US\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@type\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"WebPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? - Forage\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"isPartOf\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/#website\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"primaryImageOfPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#primaryimage\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#primaryimage\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thumbnailUrl\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pe-ratio.png\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"datePublished\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-10-20T14:00:00-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"dateModified\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2023-03-17T14:20:31-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The P/E ratio is a comparison of a company\\'s share price to its annual earnings.

The D/E ratio is an important metric in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. These balance sheet categories may include items that would not normally be considered debt or equity in the traditional sense of a loan or an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by retained earnings or losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand to what extent a company relies on debt. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of gearing ratio. The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio compares a company’s total liabilities with its shareholder equity and can be used to assess the extent of its reliance on debt. Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as the D/E ratio and the debt ratio. Or you could enter the values for total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in adjacent spreadsheet cells, say B2 and B3, then add the formula “=B2/B3” in cell B4 to obtain the D/E ratio.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.0172,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"225a5f78\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"225a5f78-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/225a5f78.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"OVBC -- Is Its Stock Price A Worthy Investment?

The higher the demand for treasury bonds, the lower the yield, and vice versa. Yields drop when demand is high and rise when demand is low.\n\n**How It Works:**\n- Bonds can be sold on the **secondary market**, where investors can purchase previously issued bonds\n- If prices on the secondary market differ from the primary market, yields automatically adjust accordingly\n- For example, if you purchase a bond on the secondary market at a lower price than it originally sold for, its yield would rise because the Treasury still has to issue a payment equal to what the original yield would have produced\n\n**What High/Low Yields Indicate:**\n- **High Treasury yields** → bond prices are low, investor demand is low due to higher confidence in other investments\n- **Low Treasury yields** → bond prices are high, investor demand is high\n\n**Economic Significance:**\n- Treasury yields are a useful **indicator of the market's economic outlook**\n- It is a **crucial economic benchmark** because it affects other interest rates\n- Mortgage rates and other borrowing costs tend to increase when the yield on the 10-year note goes up\n\n**Investment Context:**\nTreasury bonds are relatively safe investments that don't tend to pay out as much as other investments, such as stocks or real estate. Investors typically want to earn as much as possible on their investments.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Treasury Yield Definition | Investing Dictionary | U.S. News](docs/crag-finance/da7e5e26.md)",

In other words, the higher the demand for treasury bonds, the lower the yield and vice versa. Yields drop when demand is high and rise when demand is low.That\\'s because bonds can be sold on the secondary market, where investors can purchase previously issued financial instruments like bonds. If prices on the secondary market differ from the primary market, yields automatically adjust accordingly. For example, if you purchase a bond on the secondary market at a lower price than it originally sold for, its yield would rise because the Treasury still has to issue a payment equal to what the original yield would have produced. Investors typically want to earn as much as possible on their investments, and Treasury bonds are relatively safe investments that don\\'t tend to pay out as much as other investments, such as stocks or real estate. The Treasury sells bonds at auction, and prices and yields change along with demand. If Treasury yields are high, it means that bond prices are low and investor demand is low due to higher confidence in other investments. The reverse also holds true. Treasury yields are a useful indicator of the market\\'s economic outlook. If Treasury yields show that a period of economic growth is likely, investors may want to rebalance their portfolios to include more aggressive, riskier investments to take advantage of shifting macroeconomic conditions. This is a crucial economic benchmark because it affects other interest rates. Mortgage rates and other borrowing costs also tend to increase when the yield on the 10-year note goes up. Investors typically want to earn as much as possible on their investments, and Treasury bonds are relatively safe investments that don\\'t tend to pay out as much as other investments, such as stocks or real estate.\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Dividends typically are credited to a brokerage account or paid in the form of a dividend check. The dividend check is mailed to stockholders but can be direct-deposited to a shareholder\\'s account of choice, if preferred. Dividends are a way for companies to distribute profits to their shareholders, but not all companies pay dividends. Some companies may decide to retain their earnings to re-invest for growth opportunities instead. The ex-date, or ex-dividend date, is the date on or after which a security is traded without a previously declared dividend or distribution. more · What Does Ex-Dividend Mean, and What Are the Key Dates?

Does the stock price movement then make sense? We believe it does and our dashboard Coca-Cola vs. PepsiCo: Does The Stock Price Movement Make Sense? has the underlying numbers. Sure, Coca-Cola’s net income margin has increased consistently over recent years, but the one key element is the revenue. PepsiCo’s revenue base has been almost double that of Coca-Cola. Additionally, while PepsiCo’s revenues have steadily increased during the 2016-2019 period, Coca-Cola’s revenues have declined during this period due to refranchising of its bottling operations (franchise owners record revenues from bottling plants they own, while Coca-Cola earns fees from franchisees), with some revenue growth coming only in FY2019 with most refranchising already done.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.1845,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"91fa191f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"91fa191f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/91fa191f.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"HOFT | Hooker Furnishings Corp.

Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices.

Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices.

The P/E ratio is a key tool to help you compare the valuations of indiviThe price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, helps you compare the price of a company’s stock to the earnings the company generates. This comparison helps you understand whether markets are overvaluing or undervaluing a stock. The P/E ratio is a key tool to help you compare the valuations of individual stocks or entire stock indexes, such as the S&P 500. The P/E ratio is derived by dividing the price of a stock by the stock’s earnings. Think of it this way: The market price of a stock tells you how much people are willing to pay to own the shares, but the P/E ratio tells you whether the price accurately reflects the company’s earnings potential, or it’s value over time. In addition to stocks, the P/E ratio is calculated for entire stock indexes. For example, the P/E ratio of the NIFTY 50 currently stands at 22.20 . Since prices fluctuate constantly, the P/E ratio of stocks and stock indexes never stand still. The P/E ratio also changes as companies report earnings, typically on a quarterly basis. The price-to-earnings ratio is most commonly calculated using the current price of a stock, although one can use an average price over a set period of time. When it comes to the earnings part of the calculation, however, there are three varying approaches to the P/E ratio, each of which tell you different things about a stock.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.1007,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d4494e4f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d4494e4f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/d4494e4f.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? - Forage\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? - Forage\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@context\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://schema.org\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@graph\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@type\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Article\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#article\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"isPartOf\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"author\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"McKayla Girardin\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/#/schema/person/c3cfebc1817968bc8248e9b1138fb08e\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"headline\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio?\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"datePublished\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-10-20T14:00:00-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"dateModified\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2023-03-17T14:20:31-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mainEntityOfPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"wordCount\\\\\\\\\\\\\":1316,\\\\\\\\\\\\\"publisher\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/#organization\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#primaryimage\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thumbnailUrl\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pe-ratio.png\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"articleSection\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Skills\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\\\\\\"inLanguage\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"en-US\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@type\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"WebPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio? - Forage\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"isPartOf\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/#website\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"primaryImageOfPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#primaryimage\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/skills/pe-ratio#primaryimage\\\\\\\\\\\\\"},\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thumbnailUrl\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.theforage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pe-ratio.png\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"datePublished\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2022-10-20T14:00:00-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"dateModified\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2023-03-17T14:20:31-04:00\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The P/E ratio is a comparison of a company\\'s share price to its annual earnings.

The D/E ratio is an important metric in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. These balance sheet categories may include items that would not normally be considered debt or equity in the traditional sense of a loan or an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by retained earnings or losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand to what extent a company relies on debt. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of gearing ratio. The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio compares a company’s total liabilities with its shareholder equity and can be used to assess the extent of its reliance on debt. Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as the D/E ratio and the debt ratio. Or you could enter the values for total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in adjacent spreadsheet cells, say B2 and B3, then add the formula “=B2/B3” in cell B4 to obtain the D/E ratio.\\\\\"\\\\n

This comparison helps you understand whether markets are overvaluing or undervaluing a stock. The P/E ratio is a key tool to help you compare the valuations of individual stocks or entire stock indexes, such as the S&P 500. The P/E ratio is derived by dividing the price of a stock by the stock’s earnings. Think of it this way: The market price of a stock tells you how much people are willing to pay to own the shares, but the P/E ratio tells you whether the price accurately reflects the company’s earnings potential, or it’s value over time. In addition to stocks, the P/E ratio is calculated for entire stock indexes. For example, the P/E ratio of the NIFTY 50 currently stands at 22.20 . Since prices fluctuate constantly, the P/E ratio of stocks and stock indexes never stand still. The P/E ratio also changes as companies report earnings, typically on a quarterly basis. The price-to-earnings ratio is most commonly calculated using the current price of a stock, although one can use an average price over a set period of time. When it comes to the earnings part of the calculation, however, there are three varying approaches to the P/E ratio, each of which tell you different things about a stock.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.3251,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"750fb046\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"750fb046-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/750fb046.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Tesla reports record revenue and beats on earnings\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Tesla reports record revenue and beats on earnings\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Electric vehicle maker Tesla reported earnings after the bell.

Shareholders asked a question about how Musk plans to safeguard Tesla\\'s brand and reputation from any backlash resulting from his political statements, and new job as the CEO of Twitter, the social media company he acquired in October 2022. Musk replied by promoting Twitter as a great way to connect with customers: Automotive revenue amounted to $21.3 billion in the three months ending 2022, and included $324 million of deferred revenue related to the company\\'s driver assistance systems.

The company split its stock again on a seven-to-one basis on June 9, 2014, when share prices reached $645.57. In general, the accepted purpose for a stock split is that it could result in, for example, Apple stock being a more accessible and attractive purchase for individual investors who may not have as much to spend as other investors. A sixth Apple stock split could motivate individual investors and traders to put more money into Apple stock. Apple\\'s stock has split five times since its initial public offering. It\\'s important to note some key points about Apple\\'s stock history. The company\\'s stock trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol AAPL. As of Jan. 31, 2022, Apple had a market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion, closing the trading day at $174.78. Apple\\'s stock has split several times since it first went public in December 1980.

Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade. Based upon this analysis, they implement trading strategies and capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.1827,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

\\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares that change hands for a stock. This average is useful for determining which stocks are suitable for certain investors.Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume equates to how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors. Average daily trading volume is a commonly used metric and is useful for determining if a stock meets an investor\\'s or trader\\'s trade parameters. ADTV is an average, though. On any given day an asset can deviate from the average, producing much higher or lower volume. Then divide the total by X. For example, add the last 20 days of trading volume and divide by 20 to get the 20-day ADTV. Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This sentiment could be bearish or bullish, depending on the price direction. Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well. Traders and investors alike pay close attention to ADTV because it provides valuable information about the liquidity and market interest in a particular security. Risk was also managed by using the trading limit along with the ADTV crossover, allowing the stock trader to easily exit the position. This example was for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell GE stock. Also, the criteria for trading limits as well as ADTV are purely for illustration. Volume is sometimes confused with open interest. Average daily trading volume is the average of how many shares (stock market) or contracts (futures and options market) change hands in a day.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.6866,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9c7775b3\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9c7775b3-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 1,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/9c7775b3.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Autodesk Inc.

High: What It Is, How It Works, Example\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Today&#x27;s high refers to a security&#x27;s intraday high trading price or the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the day.This can be contrasted with today\\'s low, which is the trading day\\'s intraday low price. Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade. Based upon this analysis, they implement trading strategies and capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n[SEARCH NOTE] 以上为文档片段（chunks），可能不完整。如果 chunk 内容不足以完整回答问题（缺少具体步骤、命令、配置、代码），请用 Read(path) 读取对应文件获取完整上下文，严禁用通用知识补充。\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='call_e4fc02c7713641f3b5231773', content='{\"result\":\"[]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ThinkingBlock(thinking='The user is asking for the closing stock price of Hooker Furnishings Corporation on the last trading day.

Since it represents the “market” value of a company, it is computed based on the current market price (CMP) of its shares and the total number of outstanding shares. Since capitalization represents a dollar value that can vary widely, different buckets and associated nomenclatures exist for categorizing the different market cap ranges. Below are the commonly used standards for each capitalization. Companies that are considered micro-cap consist mostly of penny stocks—this category denotes companies with market capitalizations between $50 million to $300 million. For instance, a lesser-known pharma company with no marketable product and working on developing a drug for an incurable disease, or a five-person company working on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered robotics technology may be listed with a small valuation and limited trading activity. Companies may be categorized as large-, mid-, or small-cap depending on their market capitalization. Blue-chip companies are often large- or mega-cap stocks, while the very smallest are referred to as micro-caps. Market cap is calculated by multiplying a company\\'s outstanding shares by the current market price of one share.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.2515,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"db5d34b4\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"db5d34b4-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/db5d34b4.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"HOW TO CALCULATE NEPSE AND OTHER INDEX ? | by Ramesh KC | Reanda ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"HOW TO CALCULATE NEPSE AND OTHER INDEX ? | by Ramesh KC | Reanda ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"NEPSE represents the short form of Nepal Stock Exchange and NEPSE index indicates the increase or decrease of total market capitalization of companies’ transactions that are listed in Nepal Stock Exchange.

The history of securities market began with the floatation of shares by Biratnagar Jute Mills Ltd. and Nepal Bank Ltd. in 1937. Introduction of the Company Act in 1964, the first issuance of Government Bond in 1964 and the establishment of Securities Exchange Center Ltd. in 1976 were other significant development relating to capital markets. Before conversion into stock exchange it was the only capital markets institution undertaking the job of brokering, underwriting, managing public issue, market making for government bonds and other financial services. Nepal Government, under a program initiated to reform capital markets converted Securities Exchange Center into Nepal Stock Exchange in 1993.

The S&P Dow Jones Indices owns it as of 2022 and that\\'s a joint venture between S&P Global (formerly) McGraw Hill Financial, CME Group, and News Corp, the owner of Dow Jones. It tracks 500 publicly traded, large-cap U.S. companies. These businesses must meet specific criteria to be a part of the S&P 500. The mix of industries that make up the S&P 500 list often reflects the economic makeup of the United States. The S&P 500 tracks the market capitalization of the companies in its index. Market cap is the total value of all shares of stock that a company has issued. It\\'s calculated by multiplying the number of shares issued by the stock price. A company that has a market cap of $100 billion receives 10 times the representation as a company whose market cap is $10 billion. It represents the stock market\\'s performance by reporting the risks and returns of the biggest companies. Investors use it as the benchmark of the overall market, to which all other investments are compared.

over as the biggest U.S. beverage company by market value, analyst says.PepsiCo is on course to take over as the biggest US beverage company by market value, supplanting rival Coca-Cola, which has held the spot largely uninterrupted for the better part of two decades. That’s according to Wall Street analysts including Kaumil Gajrawala at Jefferies, who has initiated coverage of PepsiCo with a buy rating, calling it the sector’s “most durable business.” He projects the shares will rise more than 20% over the next year to $203, for a market value of about $279 billion. That would top the roughly $277 billion market capitalization implied by his $64 target for Coca-Cola, which he rates a hold. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is exclusively a beverage company. For PepsiCo, “hefty investments over the last half decade are yielding results, and we expect returns to accelerate,” Gajrawala wrote in a note to clients, highlighting that the company has invested about $60 billion over the past five years to make operations more efficient, increase capacity and build its brand. The call, echoed by analysts from Cowen and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., would mark a telling reversal for the soda giants: Aside from a single day in 2020, PepsiCo’s value hasn’t eclipsed Coca-Cola’s since 2006. At roughly $246 billion on Monday, Coca-Cola’s market cap is nearly $15 billion above PepsiCo’s. Coca-Cola has long held down the top spot in part due to its strong brand portfolio and record of sales growth. But PepsiCo’s food business, including Lay’s potato chips, Doritos and Quaker oatmeal, has become a key differentiator. Gajrawala expects PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay North America business will continue to outperform its other products. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is exclusively a beverage company.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -4.4894,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b8df2490\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

This indicates the increase or decrease of overall market; therefore it has significant importance to investors. The history of securities market began with the floatation of shares by Biratnagar Jute Mills Ltd. and Nepal Bank Ltd. in 1937. Introduction of the Company Act in 1964, the first issuance of Government Bond in 1964 and the establishment of Securities Exchange Center Ltd. in 1976 were other significant development relating to capital markets. Before conversion into stock exchange it was the only capital markets institution undertaking the job of brokering, underwriting, managing public issue, market making for government bonds and other financial services.

Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade. Based upon this analysis, they implement trading strategies and capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.4566,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4ba9dbdb\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4ba9dbdb-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 2,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/4ba9dbdb.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Open high low - The intraday trading strategy\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Open High Low Strategy > [What is the Open High Low Strategy?](#collapse1)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In simple words, open high low strategy is a strategy in which the buying signal\\\\\\\\nis generated when a stock has the same value for both, open and low.

This clearly shows that the money flows towards the shares that are going\\\\\\\\nto rise, and by the time the market closes, the shares are withdrawn.

The economy can be broken down into sectors, which group stocks with similar business characteristics together. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) divides the market into 11 sectors, composed of 25 industry groups and 74 industries, as of March 2023. The commonly-used system helps shape how ETFs and mutual funds are constructed. One alternative to the GICS schema is the Industry Classification Benchmark, or ICB. The ICB was developed in 2005 by Dow Jones and FTSE, and divides the market into 11 industries, 20 supersectors and then further into sectors and subsectors. It’s now used by the NASDAQ, NYSE and other international markets. The information technology sector includes companies that produce software and other IT products and services. It also contains companies that manufacture hardware such as communications equipment, mobile phones, computers and semiconductor equipment. This sector has been a fast grower and contains some of the market’s largest companies.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.9024,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6d4f6960\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6d4f6960-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/6d4f6960.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"What the S&P 500 Tells You About Americas Health\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"What the S&P 500 Tells You About America\\'s Health\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"S&amp;P stands for <strong>Standard and Poor</strong>, the names of the two founding financial companies.

The S&P Dow Jones Indices owns it as of 2022 and that\\'s a joint venture between S&P Global (formerly) McGraw Hill Financial, CME Group, and News Corp, the owner of Dow Jones. It tracks 500 publicly traded, large-cap U.S. companies. These businesses must meet specific criteria to be a part of the S&P 500. The mix of industries that make up the S&P 500 list often reflects the economic makeup of the United States. The S&P 500 tracks the market capitalization of the companies in its index. Market cap is the total value of all shares of stock that a company has issued. It\\'s calculated by multiplying the number of shares issued by the stock price. A company that has a market cap of $100 billion receives 10 times the representation as a company whose market cap is $10 billion. It represents the stock market\\'s performance by reporting the risks and returns of the biggest companies. Investors use it as the benchmark of the overall market, to which all other investments are compared.

It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance:**\\xa0In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe descent from Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index (core PCE), to fall steadily and end the year just above the Fe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...(truncated)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.2129,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 1,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"../my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Use cases\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Financial fraud detection (finance)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers the question, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Has the user paid from this location before?\\\\\\\\\\\\\", thus checking for suspicious activity in their users\\' shopping habits.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nUse one Bloom filter per user, checked for every transaction.

Since it represents the “market” value of a company, it is computed based on the current market price (CMP) of its shares and the total number of outstanding shares. Since capitalization represents a dollar value that can vary widely, different buckets and associated nomenclatures exist for categorizing the different market cap ranges. Below are the commonly used standards for each capitalization. Companies that are considered micro-cap consist mostly of penny stocks—this category denotes companies with market capitalizations between $50 million to $300 million. For instance, a lesser-known pharma company with no marketable product and working on developing a drug for an incurable disease, or a five-person company working on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered robotics technology may be listed with a small valuation and limited trading activity. Companies may be categorized as large-, mid-, or small-cap depending on their market capitalization. Blue-chip companies are often large- or mega-cap stocks, while the very smallest are referred to as micro-caps. Market cap is calculated by multiplying a company\\'s outstanding shares by the current market price of one share.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.6395,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20c10ddc\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20c10ddc-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 1,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/20c10ddc.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"BFIIW Stock Quote | Price Chart | Volume Chart (Burgerfi...)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Features\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"[Premarket Trading](/Reports/PremarketTrading)\\\\\\\\n[After Hours Trading](/Reports/AfterHoursTrading)\\\\\\\\n[Market Movers](/Reports/MarketMovers)\\\\\\\\n[S&P 500 Volume Burst Trades](/Reports/SP-500-Volume-Burst-Trades)\\\\\\\\n[52-Week Highs & Lows](/Reports/Equity52WeekHighsAndLows)\\\\\\\\n[Stock Order Imbalance](/Reports/StockOrderImbalanceReport)\\\\\\\\n[Unusual Stock Volume](/Reports/UnusualStockVolumeR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...(truncated)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.702,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9a6fa550\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9a6fa550-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 2,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"../my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/ai_agent_framework_crash_course/google_adk_crash_course/9_multi_agent_patterns/9_3_parallel_agent/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"⚡ Tutorial 9.3: Parallel Agents -

Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade. Based upon this analysis, they implement trading strategies and capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.4303,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"de782b83\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"de782b83-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/de782b83.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"CGI Inc Share Price Today | TSX GIBa Stock - Investing.com India\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"CGI Inc Share Price Today | TSX GIBa Stock - Investing.com India\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"View the real-time CGI Inc (TSX GIBa) share price and assess historical data, charts, technical analysis and the share chat forum.CGI Inc share price live 137.56, this page displays TSX GIBa stock exchange data.

This average is useful for determining which stocks are suitable for certain investors.Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume equates to how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors. Average daily trading volume is a commonly used metric and is useful for determining if a stock meets an investor\\'s or trader\\'s trade parameters. ADTV is an average, though. On any given day an asset can deviate from the average, producing much higher or lower volume. Then divide the total by X. For example, add the last 20 days of trading volume and divide by 20 to get the 20-day ADTV. Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This sentiment could be bearish or bullish, depending on the price direction. Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well. Traders and investors alike pay close attention to ADTV because it provides valuable information about the liquidity and market interest in a particular security. Risk was also managed by using the trading limit along with the ADTV crossover, allowing the stock trader to easily exit the position. This example was for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell GE stock. Also, the criteria for trading limits as well as ADTV are purely for illustration. Volume is sometimes confused with open interest. Average daily trading volume is the average of how many shares (stock market) or contracts (futures and options market) change hands in a day.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.6776,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4a1c8e19\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4a1c8e19-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/4a1c8e19.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Volume is a simple yet powerful way for traders and investors to increase profits and minimize risks.At a market bottom, falling prices eventually force out large numbers of traders, resulting in volatility and increased volume. We will see a decrease in volume after the spike in these situations, but how volume continues to play out over the next days, weeks, and months can be analyzed by using the other volume guidelines. Daily volume is the most common time frame used when discussing stock volume. Average daily trading volume is the daily volume of shares traded, averaged over a number of days; this smooths out days when trading volume is unusually low or high.

shares or contracts traded for a specified security during a set period of time.Volume of trade measures the total number of shares or contracts transacted for a specified security during a specified time period. It includes the total number of shares transacted between a buyer and seller during a transaction. When securities are more actively traded, their trade volume is high, and when securities are less actively traded, their trade volume is low. Each market exchange tracks its trading volume and provides volume data. The volumes of trade numbers are reported as often as once an hour throughout the current trading day. These hourly reported trade volumes are estimates. A trade volume reported at the end of the day is also an estimate. Volume of trade is the total quantity of shares or contracts traded for a specified security. It can be measured on any type of security traded during a trading day.

The incident could be a CICS region crash or a batch program abend.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\\\\\\\nIn my experience, the problem with the log volume becoming full\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nand causing the (SFS and RQS) server to crash always has the root cause\\\\\\\\nof the presence of a transaction being in the commitcomplete state.\\\\\\\\nA transaction is in the commitcomplete state when all participants\\\\\\\\nhave agreed to commit, and then one of the participants has failed to\\\\\\\\nactually perform its commit. I will now explain why even one such\\\\\\\\ntransaction can cause the log to fill up.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs log records are written to the log, the log will continue to become\\\\\\\\nmore full. The log regularly checks itself to see how much free space it has.\\\\\\\\nWhen the percent of free space is sufficiently small, say 25%, it will check\\\\\\\\nto see if it can throw away old records. When you see the log go from 75% full\\\\\\\\nto 1% full, that\\'s because the oldest record for any transaction that is still alive\\\\\\\\nis quite recent, and virtually all of the records in the log can be thrown away and their\\\\\\\\nspace reclaimed. When a transaction is in the commitcomplete state, as far as the\\\\\\\\nlog is concerned, that transaction is still alive. Therefore none of the log records\\\\\\\\nput in the log since that transaction can be thrown away, and the log will fill up\\\\\\\\nuntil the server crashes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn other words, the log filling up is not really caused by too much work being\\\\\\\\ndone now, but rather because there is an old unfinished transaction clogging up the log.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe normal method of handling the log filling up to a dangerous level is 2 steps:\\\\\\\\n1) tkadmin list transaction\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen examine the output and see if there are any transactions in the commitcomplete state.\\\\\\\\nIf there are any, then for all of them, perform step 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2) tkadmin force transaction <tid> -finish\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf this command succeeds, then the transaction which was stuck is now dead.\\\\\\\\nThe next time the log tries to throw away old records and reclaim space,\\\\\\\\nit will detect that this oldest record for the stuck transaction is dead, and reclaim\\\\\\\\nall the space for all records until a live transaction record is reached, Usually the log\\\\\\\\nwill now have most of its space free.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, the force tran -finish does not explicitly reclaim space, so the log may\\\\\\\\nstill appear to be full.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn some cases bringing down the CICS region may help to determine which transactions to perform the force on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3) tkadmin force checkpoint\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow the log checks its oldest record, sees that the tran for that record is dead, and\\\\\\\\nreclaims space as discussed above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOther DCF documents to review -\\\\\\\\nResolving a Stuck Transaction:\\\\\\\\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21045910 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21045910]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpanding CICS volumes on UNIX systems\\\\\\\\nhttp://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21616731 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21616731]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpanding CICS volumes - Windows Edition\\\\\\\\nhttps://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/165307/how-can-i-expand-the-txseries-sfs-volumes-on-windo.html [https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/165307/how-can-i-expand-the-txseries-sfs-volumes-on-windo.html]\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n[SEARCH NOTE] 以上为文档片段（chunks），可能不完整。如果 chunk 内容不足以完整回答问题（缺少具体步骤、命令、配置、代码），请用 Read(path) 读取对应文件获取完整上下文，严禁用通用知识补充。\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='call_026bb3ddd9e84dadaf616934', content='{\"result\":\"[]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ThinkingBlock(thinking='The user is asking about the trading volume of MGRM on the last trading day.

The D/E ratio is an important metric in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. These balance sheet categories may include items that would not normally be considered debt or equity in the traditional sense of a loan or an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by retained earnings or losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand to what extent a company relies on debt. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of gearing ratio. The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio compares a company’s total liabilities with its shareholder equity and can be used to assess the extent of its reliance on debt. Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as the D/E ratio and the debt ratio. Or you could enter the values for total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in adjacent spreadsheet cells, say B2 and B3, then add the formula “=B2/B3” in cell B4 to obtain the D/E ratio.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.9715,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"695151c2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"695151c2-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/695151c2.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"MSFT (Microsoft) Debt-to-Equity\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"MSFT (Microsoft) Debt-to-Equity\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"MSFT (Microsoft) Debt-to-Equity as of today (February 09, 2024) is 0.37.

The D/E ratio is an important metric in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. These balance sheet categories may include items that would not normally be considered debt or equity in the traditional sense of a loan or an asset. Because the ratio can be distorted by retained earnings or losses, intangible assets, and pension plan adjustments, further research is usually needed to understand to what extent a company relies on debt. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. The debt-to-equity ratio is a particular type of gearing ratio. The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio compares a company’s total liabilities with its shareholder equity and can be used to assess the extent of its reliance on debt. Microsoft Excel provides a balance sheet template that automatically calculates financial ratios such as the D/E ratio and the debt ratio. Or you could enter the values for total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in adjacent spreadsheet cells, say B2 and B3, then add the formula “=B2/B3” in cell B4 to obtain the D/E ratio.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.6535,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"695151c2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"695151c2-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/695151c2.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"MSFT (Microsoft) Debt-to-Equity\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"MSFT (Microsoft) Debt-to-Equity\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"MSFT (Microsoft) Debt-to-Equity as of today (February 09, 2024) is 0.37.

Seasonally, you can measure average rainfall depth, average daily temperature, and the maximum number of sunny hours per day, for example. Watch the increase of the maximum daily temperature over the years. Predict the expected temperature and rainfall depth in a specific location for a particular week of the year.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultiple time series can be collected, each for a different location. By utilizing secondary indexes, measurements can be aggregated over given geographical regions (e.g., minimal and maximal daily temperature in Europe) or over locations with specific attributes (e.g., average rainfall depth in mountainous regions).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample metrics include: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Rain (cm)\\\\\\\\n- Temperature (C)\\\\\\\\n- Sunny periods (h)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Analysis of the atmosphere (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe atmospheric concentration of CO2 is more important than ever before. Use TimeSeries to track average, maximum and minimum CO2 level per season and average yearly CO2 over the last decades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Concentration of CO2 (ppm)\\\\\\\\n- Location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Flight data recording (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlanes have a multitude of sensors. This sensor data is stored in a black box and also shared with external systems. TimeSeries can help you reconstruct the sequence of events over time, optimize operations and maintenance intervals, improve safety, and provide feedback to the equipment manufacturers about the part quality. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Altitude\\\\\\\\n- Flight path\\\\\\\\n- Engine temperature\\\\\\\\n- Level of vibrations\\\\\\\\n- Pressure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ship logbooks (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s very common to keep track of ship voyages via (digital) logbooks. Use TimeSeries to calculate optimal routes using these metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Wind (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Ocean conditions (classes)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (knots)\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Connected car (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern cars are exposing several metrics via a standard interface. Use TimeSeries to correlate average fuel consumption with the tire pressure, figure out how long to keep a car in the fleet, determine optimal maintenance intervals, and calculate tax savings by type of the road (taxable vs. nontaxable roads). Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Acceleration\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n- Fuel level (liter)\\\\\\\\n- Distances (km)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Tire pressure\\\\\\\\n- Distance until next maintenance check\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Smart metering (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern houses and facilities gather details about energy consumption/production. Use Redis Time Series to aggregate billing based on monthly consumption. Optimize the network by redirecting the energy delivery relative to the fluctuations in need. Provide recommendations on how to improve the energy consumption behavior. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Consumption per location\\\\\\\\n- Produced amount of electrical energy per location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Quality of service (telecom)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMobile phone usage is increasing, producing a natural growth that just correlates to the increasing number of cellphones. However, there might also be spikes that correlate with specific events (for example, more messages around world championships). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTelecom providers need to ensure that they are providing the necessary infrastructure to deliver the right quality of service. This includes using mini towers for short-term peaks. Use TimeSeries to correlate traffic peaks to specific events, load balance traffic over several towers or mini towers, and predictively plan the infrastructure. Metrics include the amount of traffic per tower.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Stock trading (finance)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStock trading is highly automated today. Algorithms, and not just human beings, are trading, from the amount of bids and asks for the trading of a stock to the extreme volumes of trades per second (millions of ops per second). Computer-driven trading requires millisecond response times. It\\'s necessary to keep a lot of data points within a very short period of time (for example, price fluctuations per second within a minute). In addition, the long-term history needs to be kept to make statements about trends or for regulatory purposes.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse Redis Time Series to identify correlations between the trading behavior and other events (for example, social network posts). Discover a developing market. Detect anomalies to discover insider trades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Exact time and order of a trade by itself\\\\\\\\n- Type of the event (trade/bid)\\\\\\\\n- The stock price\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"agent_hint\\\\\": \\\\\"[overview | gaps:incomplete_steps,missing_command,missing_config,missing_example]\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"evidence_flags\\\\\": {\\\\n      \\\\\"has_command\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_config\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_code_block\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_steps\\\\\": false\\\\n    }\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.5008,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"70677d2a\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"70677d2a-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 2,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/archive/TEST_REPORT.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TEST_REPORT.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"知识库搜索系统 - 测试报告 > 3. 测试知识库 > 3.2 Redis 中文文档\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"unknown\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- **来源**: https://github.com/kubernetes/website\\\\\\\\n- **格式**: Markdown (原生)\\\\\\\\n- **语言**: 英文\\\\\\\\n- **已索引**: 部分文档（Pod, Deployment, Service 等）\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **来源**: https://github.com/CnDoc/redis-doc-cn\\\\\\\\n- **格式**: HTML → Markdown (pandoc 转换)\\\\\\\\n- **语言**: 中文\\\\\\\\n- **已索引**: 10 个文档\\\\\\\\n- **分层索引**: ✅ 已生成 (index.json + INDEX.md)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"agent_hint\\\\\": \\\\\"[overview | gaps:incomplete_steps,missing_example]\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"evidence_flags\\\\\": {\\\\n      \\\\\"has_command\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_config\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_code_block\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_steps\\\\\": true\\\\n    }\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.8671,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d308e8ff\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d308e8ff-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/d308e8ff.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"secure socket layer IR440015 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"secure socket layer IR440015 TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\\\\\\\\n In a multi-tier environment with SSL enabled on the webserver, images are not being displayed when report run as PDF.

Trading volume is a technical indicator because it represents the overall activity of a security or a market. Investors often use trading volume to confirm the existence or continuation of a trend, or a trend reversal. Trading volume is defined as the number of shares traded in a particular period of time. So, low trading volume can indicate a lack of interest in either buying or selling. That means it could be bullish if low volume occurs in a downtrend. It could be bearish if it\\'s noted in an uptrend. Trading volume is one of the metrics that traders watch to predict the momentum of a stock or other security.

This average is useful for determining which stocks are suitable for certain investors.Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume equates to how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors. Average daily trading volume is a commonly used metric and is useful for determining if a stock meets an investor\\'s or trader\\'s trade parameters. ADTV is an average, though. On any given day an asset can deviate from the average, producing much higher or lower volume. Then divide the total by X. For example, add the last 20 days of trading volume and divide by 20 to get the 20-day ADTV. Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This sentiment could be bearish or bullish, depending on the price direction. Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well. Traders and investors alike pay close attention to ADTV because it provides valuable information about the liquidity and market interest in a particular security. Risk was also managed by using the trading limit along with the ADTV crossover, allowing the stock trader to easily exit the position. This example was for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell GE stock. Also, the criteria for trading limits as well as ADTV are purely for illustration. Volume is sometimes confused with open interest. Average daily trading volume is the average of how many shares (stock market) or contracts (futures and options market) change hands in a day.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.7589,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"aee80084\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"aee80084-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/aee80084.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc.

According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, these 5 tech stocks were responsible for more than 20% of the S&P 500’s 31% return in 2019. When you see a handful of stocks dominate in such a way it can make some investors nervous. What happens to the stock market if these companies begin to sell off? Is the rest of the market participating in this rally or is it all being driven by just a small number of stocks? One of the things that jumps out from this list is how high the turnover at the top can be. Every decade there were at least five to six new names at the top of the list. While technology firms dominate the top slots today, in the early-1980s it was energy companies. The behemoth tech stocks have taken advantage of these trends but it was not preordained that these companies would be where they are today. Apple was rescued by Microsoft with a $150 million loan in 1997 which was one year before Google was founded.

[Active fixed income team](#active-fixed-income-team)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVanguard Active Fixed Income perspectives is our quarterly in-depth commentary. It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance:**\\xa0In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe descent from Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index (core PCE), to fall steadily and end the year just above the Fe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...(truncated)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n

[Active fixed income team](#active-fixed-income-team)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVanguard Active Fixed Income perspectives is our quarterly in-depth commentary. It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance:**\\xa0In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Looking ahead:**\\xa0Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Approach:**\\xa0Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe descent from Yield Mountain\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index (core PCE), to fall steadily and end the year just above the Fe\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n...(truncated)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.5075,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"001b3b84\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"001b3b84-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/001b3b84.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Single-Payer Health Care: A Tale of 3 States – Third Way\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"svg:not(:root).svg-inline--fa {\\\\\\\\noverflow: visible;

Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade. Based upon this analysis, they implement trading strategies and capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.151,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4ba9dbdb\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4ba9dbdb-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/4ba9dbdb.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Open high low - The intraday trading strategy\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Open high low - The intraday trading strategy\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#HTMLloading { background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1) url(https://www.nirmalbang.com/app\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_themes/images/logo.png)no-repeat center center; position: fixed; left: 0; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; z-index: 99999; }\\\\\\\\n@media screen and (max-width: 479px) {\\\\\\\\n#HTMLloading { background-size: 65%; }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n!function (e, a, t, n, g, c, o) { e.GoogleAnalyticsObject = g, e.ga = e.ga || function () { (e.ga.q = e.ga.q || []).push(arguments) }, e.ga.l = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* new Date, c = a.createElement(t), o = a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0], c.async = 1, c.src = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js\\\\\\\\\\\\\", o.parentNode.insertBefore(c, o) } (window, document, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"script\\\\\\\\\\\\\", 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"ga\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), ga(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"create\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"UA-66148552-1\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"auto\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), ga(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"send\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"pageview\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nwindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\\\\\\\\nfunction gtag() { dataLayer.push(arguments); }\\\\\\\\ngtag(\\'js\\', new Date());\\\\\\\\ngtag(\\'config\\', \\'AW-962092335\\');\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndataLayer = []\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n!function (e, t, a, n, g) { e[n] = e[n] || [], e[n].push({ \\\\\\\\\\\\\"gtm.start\\\\\\\\\\\\\": (new Date).getTime(), event: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"gtm.js\\\\\\\\\\\\\" }); var m = t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0], r = t.createElement(a); r.async = !0, r.src = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-N7M54Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\", m.parentNode.insertBefore(r, m) } (window, document, \\\\\\\\\\\\\"script\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"dataLayer\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@context\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://schema.org\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@type\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"FAQPage\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mainEntity\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [{\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@type\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Question\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"How to Open Demat Account Online?\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"acceptedAnswer\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@type\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Answer\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Step 1: choose a Depository Participant (DP) to open the account with.

This average is useful for determining which stocks are suitable for certain investors.Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume equates to how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors. Average daily trading volume is a commonly used metric and is useful for determining if a stock meets an investor\\'s or trader\\'s trade parameters. ADTV is an average, though. On any given day an asset can deviate from the average, producing much higher or lower volume. Then divide the total by X. For example, add the last 20 days of trading volume and divide by 20 to get the 20-day ADTV. Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This sentiment could be bearish or bullish, depending on the price direction. Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well. Traders and investors alike pay close attention to ADTV because it provides valuable information about the liquidity and market interest in a particular security. Risk was also managed by using the trading limit along with the ADTV crossover, allowing the stock trader to easily exit the position. This example was for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell GE stock. Also, the criteria for trading limits as well as ADTV are purely for illustration. Volume is sometimes confused with open interest. Average daily trading volume is the average of how many shares (stock market) or contracts (futures and options market) change hands in a day.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.8662,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4a1c8e19\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4a1c8e19-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/4a1c8e19.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Volume is a simple yet powerful way for traders and investors to increase profits and minimize risks.At a market bottom, falling prices eventually force out large numbers of traders, resulting in volatility and increased volume. We will see a decrease in volume after the spike in these situations, but how volume continues to play out over the next days, weeks, and months can be analyzed by using the other volume guidelines. Daily volume is the most common time frame used when discussing stock volume. Average daily trading volume is the daily volume of shares traded, averaged over a number of days; this smooths out days when trading volume is unusually low or high.

Trading volume is a technical indicator because it represents the overall activity of a security or a market. Investors often use trading volume to confirm the existence or continuation of a trend, or a trend reversal. Trading volume is defined as the number of shares traded in a particular period of time. So, low trading volume can indicate a lack of interest in either buying or selling. That means it could be bullish if low volume occurs in a downtrend. It could be bearish if it\\'s noted in an uptrend. Trading volume is one of the metrics that traders watch to predict the momentum of a stock or other security.

This average is useful for determining which stocks are suitable for certain investors.Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume equates to how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors. Average daily trading volume is a commonly used metric and is useful for determining if a stock meets an investor\\'s or trader\\'s trade parameters. ADTV is an average, though. On any given day an asset can deviate from the average, producing much higher or lower volume. Then divide the total by X. For example, add the last 20 days of trading volume and divide by 20 to get the 20-day ADTV. Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This sentiment could be bearish or bullish, depending on the price direction. Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well. Traders and investors alike pay close attention to ADTV because it provides valuable information about the liquidity and market interest in a particular security. Risk was also managed by using the trading limit along with the ADTV crossover, allowing the stock trader to easily exit the position. This example was for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell GE stock. Also, the criteria for trading limits as well as ADTV are purely for illustration. Volume is sometimes confused with open interest. Average daily trading volume is the average of how many shares (stock market) or contracts (futures and options market) change hands in a day.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.9586,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"61e7db98\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"61e7db98-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/61e7db98.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Todays High: What It Is, How It Works, Example\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Today\\'s High: What It Is, How It Works, Example\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Today&#x27;s high refers to a security&#x27;s intraday high trading price or the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the day.This can be contrasted with today\\'s low, which is the trading day\\'s intraday low price.

Based upon this analysis, they implement trading strategies and capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -4.402,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

close. The adjusted closing price accounts for any distribution that affects the price.For example, let\\'s assume that the closing price for one share of XYZ Corp. is $20 on Thursday. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). These distributions may include cash dividends, stock dividends, or stock splits. The adjusted closing price is often used when examining historical returns or performing a detailed analysis of historical returns. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). If XYZ Corp. announces a 2:1 stock dividend instead of a cash dividend, the adjusted closing price calculation will change. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. For cash dividends, the value of the dividend is deducted from the last closing sale price of the stock.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.5343,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8e7bb686\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8e7bb686-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/8e7bb686.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"How Product Releases Affect Apples Stock Price\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"How Product Releases Affect Apple\\'s Stock Price\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Apple&#x27;s stock has split five times ...

On Feb. 28, 2005, Apple split its stock again when it hit $88.99. These last two were also two-for-one splits. The company split its stock again on a seven-to-one basis on June 9, 2014, when share prices reached $645.57. In general, the accepted purpose for a stock split is that it could result in, for example, Apple stock being a more accessible and attractive purchase for individual investors who may not have as much to spend as other investors. A sixth Apple stock split could motivate individual investors and traders to put more money into Apple stock. Apple\\'s stock has split five times since its initial public offering. It\\'s important to note some key points about Apple\\'s stock history. The company\\'s stock trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol AAPL. As of Jan. 31, 2022, Apple had a market capitalization of nearly $3 trillion, closing the trading day at $174.78. Apple\\'s stock has split several times since it first went public in December 1980.

The economy can be broken down into sectors, which group stocks with similar business characteristics together. The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) divides the market into 11 sectors, composed of 25 industry groups and 74 industries, as of March 2023. The commonly-used system helps shape how ETFs and mutual funds are constructed. One alternative to the GICS schema is the Industry Classification Benchmark, or ICB. The ICB was developed in 2005 by Dow Jones and FTSE, and divides the market into 11 industries, 20 supersectors and then further into sectors and subsectors. It’s now used by the NASDAQ, NYSE and other international markets. The information technology sector includes companies that produce software and other IT products and services. It also contains companies that manufacture hardware such as communications equipment, mobile phones, computers and semiconductor equipment. This sector has been a fast grower and contains some of the market’s largest companies.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n[SEARCH NOTE] 以上为文档片段（chunks），可能不完整。如果 chunk 内容不足以完整回答问题（缺少具体步骤、命令、配置、代码），请用 Read(path) 读取对应文件获取完整上下文，严禁用通用知识补充。\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ThinkingBlock(thinking=\"The initial search didn't return specific information about healthcare sector M&A value in 2018.

The S&P Dow Jones Indices owns it as of 2022 and that\\'s a joint venture between S&P Global (formerly) McGraw Hill Financial, CME Group, and News Corp, the owner of Dow Jones. It tracks 500 publicly traded, large-cap U.S. companies. These businesses must meet specific criteria to be a part of the S&P 500. The mix of industries that make up the S&P 500 list often reflects the economic makeup of the United States. The S&P 500 tracks the market capitalization of the companies in its index. Market cap is the total value of all shares of stock that a company has issued. It\\'s calculated by multiplying the number of shares issued by the stock price. A company that has a market cap of $100 billion receives 10 times the representation as a company whose market cap is $10 billion. It represents the stock market\\'s performance by reporting the risks and returns of the biggest companies. Investors use it as the benchmark of the overall market, to which all other investments are compared.

After increasing the statement cache size in the data source, an Oracle ORA-01000 error happens.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSYMPTOM\\\\\\\\nYou might see the following exception in SystemOut.log:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\njava.sql.SQLException: ORA-01000: maximum open cursors exceeded\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processError(T4CTTIoer.java:439)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIoer.processError(T4CTTIoer.java:395)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4C8Oall.processError(T4C8Oall.java:802)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIfun.receive(T4CTTIfun.java:436)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CTTIfun.doRPC(T4CTTIfun.java:186)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4C8Oall.doOALL(T4C8Oall.java:521)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CPreparedStatement.doOall8(T4CPreparedStatement.java:205)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CPreparedStatement.executeForRows(T4CPreparedStatement.java:1008)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleStatement.doExecuteWithTimeout(OracleStatement.java:1307)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.executeInternal(OraclePreparedStatement.java:3449)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatement.execute(OraclePreparedStatement.java:3550)\\\\\\\\nat oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatementWrapper.execute(OraclePreparedStatementWrapper.java:1374)\\\\\\\\nat com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.WSJdbcPreparedStatement.pmiExecute(WSJdbcPreparedStatement.java:958)\\\\\\\\nat com.ibm.ws.rsadapter.jdbc.WSJdbcPreparedStatement.execute(WSJdbcPreparedStatement.java:625)\\\\\\\\nat teamworks.sql.SQLClient.executePreparedStatement(SQLClient.java:443)\\\\\\\\nat teamworks.sql.SQLClient.execute(SQLClient.java:216)\\\\\\\\nat teamworks.SQLConnector$5.execute(SQLConnector.java:232)\\\\\\\\nat teamworks.SQLConnector$5.execute(SQLConnector.java:228)\\\\\\\\nat teamworks.sql.SQLExecutor.doExecute(SQLExecutor.java:134)\\\\\\\\nat teamworks.sql.SQLExecutor.execute(SQLExecutor.java:79)\\\\\\\\nat teamworks.SQLConnector.execute(SQLConnector.java:227)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCAUSE\\\\\\\\nThe Oracle ORA-01000 error occurs because the statement cache size property for the data source is set to a value higher than the maximum number of open cursors in the Oracle database. But, in this case, it is not good to simply increase the maximum number of open cursors in the Oracle database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe root cause is that bind variable is not used in your SQL integration service. The SQL string that is passed to the SQL integration service contains literal values. Because most of the SQL statements for one SQL integration service have different literal values, a matching statement cannot be found in statement cache (shared pool). The cache hit ratio is very low and the execution plan is generated for each SQL statement every time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\\\\\\\nTo resolve this issue, use a bind variable in your SQL integration service.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor information on how to use the bind variable in the IBM Business Process Manager SQL integration service, see the following developerWorks article: Using the SQL integration service with WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2 and WebSphere Application Server V7 [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/tutorials/1110_phi/].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about the Oracle ORA-01000 error and its corresponding solution, see the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"ORA-01000: maximum open cursors exceeded\\\\\\\\\\\\\" connecting to an Oracle database from WebSphere Application Server [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21218727] document.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Standard Databases AIX, Linux, Linux zSeries, Solaris, Windows 8.5, 8.0.1, 8.0, 7.5.1, 7.5 Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Express Databases Linux, Windows 8.5, 8.0.1, 8.0, 7.5.1, 7.5\\\\\\\\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\\\\\\\\n BPM\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.4072,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"07c75e3a\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"07c75e3a-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/07c75e3a.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\\\\\\\\n I am trying to start SPSS for Windows and I receive the following errors:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe current license does not permit this job to continue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nfollowed by...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nError # 7003\\\\\\\\nThe license for SPSS for Windows has expired.\\\\\\\\nThis command not executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecific symptom number: 213\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat is the problem?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\\\\\\\nIF the product presenting the error 7003/symptom 213 is licensed via the Sentinel RMS License Manager, THEN refer to KnowledgeBase resolution 91720.\\\\\\\\nIF the product presenting error 7003/symptom 213 is licensed with a Single-User or Site license authorization code, THEN go to (A).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(A)\\\\\\\\nIF your was working normally for more than 14 days prior to presenting error 7003/symptom 213, THEN go to (B)\\\\\\\\nIF your product has been working for no more than 14 days prior to presenting error 7003/symptom 213, THEN go to (E)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(B)\\\\\\\\nConfirm the date and time on the computer are correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIF date/time is NOT correct, THEN got to (C)\\\\\\\\nIF date/time is correct, THEN go to (D).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(C)\\\\\\\\n1) Reset the date/time on the computer.\\\\\\\\n2) Start the IBM SPSS product.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIF the error message persists, THEN go to (D)\\\\\\\\nIF the error not longer presents, then the problem has been resolved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(D)\\\\\\\\n1) Delete (or rename) the file named \\'lservrc\\' found in program installation directory of the IBM SPSS product.\\\\\\\\n2) License the IBM SPSS product using the License Authorization Wizard and your product authorization code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(E)\\\\\\\\n1) Please contact IBM SPSS Customer Service via email at spsscs@us.ibm.com or via phone at 800-521-1337.\\\\\\\\n2) Provide IBM SPSS Customer Service with the license authorization code used to license your IBM SPSS product.\\\\\\\\n3) Request confirmation that the license authorization code is for the correct product.\\\\\\\\n4) Request confirmation that the license authorization code includes the \\'base\\' module (if applicable).\\\\\\\\n5) Request confirmation that the license authorization code is not expired\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Need more help?

See the V.R.M.F Maintenance Stream Delivery Vehicle terminology explanation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] for more details.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModification and fix pack numbers are the third and fourth digits in the IBM product version number, for example: 8.5.M.F.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModification and fix packs include only bug fixes, so they do not affect the product functionality or your data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the following technotes to find out which update your installation need:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Finding the version of ODM product and fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21627850] to determine the exact product versions that are installed on your machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Find the version of ODM components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738] to determine the exact module or library versions that are deployed on your servers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] to learn about the latest modification or fix pack that is available for your product version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * IBM Operational Decision Manager detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023067] to verify that your configuration is supported with your current product version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] to verify that your current version does not reach end of support in the near future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReferring to the last two documents above, you may find out that you need to migrate to the latest product version to ensure continued support of your applications. In that case, refer to technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat being said, make sure to consider migrating to the latest version or release ( V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from the latest added features and improvements.\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nAs with any software product, even if you do not have any issues with running your current configuration, you should apply the latest modification or fix pack to take advantage of these benefits:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Anticipate and avoid the risk of encountering defects already fixed.\\\\\\\\n * Apply the latest product improvements that are available (performance, for example).\\\\\\\\n * Maintain a serviceable system and be able to install an interim fix when required.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWHEN TO UPDATE\\\\\\\\nThe latest modification or fix pack should be installed as soon as it is available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can subscribe to the IBM Support My Notifications [https://www.ibm.com/support/mynotifications] to be notified of any fix pack releases, and you can also bookmark the Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] page, which lists the latest modifications or fix packs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the technote Fix pack release notification for Operational Decision Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593] to find out when a modification or fix pack will be available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBEFORE UPDATING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe databases used in the sample server are deleted and recreated during the update. If you are using those databases and want to save the existing content, perform the following steps before updating:\\\\\\\\n *  Stop the sample server. In the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby, create an archive file containing the resdb and rtsdb folders. Save the archive file, such as zip file, in the data folder. After installation, unzip the archive file in the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby to restore your databases before restarting the sample server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA new profile is also created for the sample server, at the first server start following the installation of a modification or fix pack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to continue using the same ports, you must delete the existing profile prior. In the <ODM_HOME>/shared/bin folder, from the command line, run the command ../tools/ant/bin/ant forcedestroyprofile.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: The sample server is not designed to be used in a production system. For a production system, you must create a dedicated profile and database that you update using the following steps.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach modification or fix pack page provides instructions on how to download and run the installer, in addition to providing a list of corrections that are included in the update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fix pack installation updates the following files and folders:  * JAR libraries in the installation directories, including <ODMInstallDir>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<Module>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lib.\\\\\\\\n * EAR and WAR applications in the <ODMInstallDir>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<Module>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\applicationservers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<App Server> folders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce this is done, you perform these tasks:  * Repackage your client applications with the up-to-date libraries.\\\\\\\\n * Reapply product customizations to the up-to-date Java EE modules (EARs and WARs).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that all customizations you developed before the update, for example modifications of the descriptors, must be reapplied to the new, up-to-date EARs and WARs. It is a good idea to document and automate those customizations using scripts to make the process easier and error-proof.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, you must update the client applications and ODM modules on your server or servers with the same settings as you deployed previously. If you redeploy the application, follow again the documentation instructions to deploy all ODM modules to your servers [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.distrib.config/topics/odm_distrib_config.html].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKeep in mind that applying a modification or a fix pack does not require any data migration, so your projects and database remain the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATING RULE EXECUTION SERVER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdate the following applications in the application server:  *  jrules-res-xu-<server>.rar jrules-res-management-<server>.ear jrules-ssp-<server>.ear jrules-res-htds-<server>ear\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: Updating the eXecution Unit RAR file requires a restart of the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATE DECISION CENTER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdate the following application in your application server:\\\\\\\\n * jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATE THE EVENTS RUNTIME\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 1. Stop the event runtime application, wberuntimeear.\\\\\\\\n 2. Uninstall the following applications, if they exist:  * wbefileconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbehttpconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbejdbcconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbejmsconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbesoapconnector\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 3. Update the application wberuntimeear.\\\\\\\\n 4. Start the application wberuntimeear.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\\\\\\\\n * Again, in addition to applying the latest modification or fix pack, consider migrating to the latest version or release (V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from recently added features and improvements. See our technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725] for more information.\\\\\\\\n * For JRules 7.1, you can refer to the JRules 7.1 list of fix packs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019787] and also Upgrading JRules to the latest V7.1 fix pack [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21474292] to learn how to apply the fix packs. But note that JRules 7.1 reaches end of support in September 2015 (see the IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] page). To ensure continued product support, plan an upgrade to the latest product version before that date.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Fix pack release notification for ODM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593 ]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Maintenance Platform Independent 7.1, 7.0\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.7839,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"11991e77\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"11991e77-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/11991e77.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"NEWS\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"NEWS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nABSTRACT\\\\\\\\n The WebSphere MQ (WMQ) Support Portal page has been replaced by the IBM MQ Support Portal page.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCONTENT\\\\\\\\nThe WebSphere MQ product name was changed to IBM MQ starting with v8.
