For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted.

For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside?

They are optimized for:\n- Appending new entries\n- Reading entries in order\n- Log data and time series\n- Built-in support for consumer groups with at-least-once delivery\n\n### Basic Commands\n\n**Adding Messages (Producer)**:\n```\nXADD mystream * field1 value1 field2 value2\n```\n- `*` auto-generates a unique ID based on timestamp\n- Returns the generated ID (e.g., `1657030402506-0`)\n\n**With Idempotency (Redis 8.6+)**:\n```\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value\n```\n- `IDMP`: Manual producer ID and message ID for deduplication\n- `IDMPAUTO`: Automatic deduplication based on message content\n- Prevents duplicate messages when producers retry after network issues or crashes\n\n### Consumer Groups\n\nStreams have built-in support for consumer groups to:\n- Manage multiple readers\n- Ensure at-least-once delivery\n- Distribute messages across consumers\n- Track which messages have been processed\n\n### Operations\n\nThe main operations available are:\n- **Add**: Append new entries to the stream\n- **Read**: Read entries in order\n- **Trim**: Remove old entries (capped streams)\n\n### Use Cases\n\nRedis Streams are suitable for:\n- Message queuing systems\n- Log data collection\n- Time series data\n- Event sourcing\n- Real-time analytics\n- Any append-only data

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.501,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"It\\'s not just a matter of RTT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Request/Response server can be implemented so that it is able to process new requests even if the client hasn\\'t already read the old responses.\\\\\\\\nThis way it is possible to send *multiple commands* to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use for many decades.\\\\\\\\nFor instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has supported pipelining since its early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.\\\\\\\\nThis is an example using the raw netcat utility:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash \\\\\\\\n$ (printf \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; sleep 1) | nc localhost 6379\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time we don\\'t pay the cost of RTT for every call, but just once for the three commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be explicit, with pipelining the order of operations of our very first example will be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the client sends commands using pipelining, the server will be forced to queue the replies, using memory. So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.0149,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/streams/idempotency.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotent message processing\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotency modes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when using at-least-once delivery patterns. This feature enables reliable message submission with automatic deduplication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdempotent message processing ensures that handling the same message multiple times produces the same system state as handling it once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeginning with Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when producers resend messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProducers may need to resend messages under two scenarios:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producer-Redis network issues (disconnection and reconnection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If a disconnection occurs after the producer executes `XADD`, but before it receives the reply, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The producer crashes and restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If the producer crashes after calling `XADD` but before receiving the reply and marking a message as delivered, after a restart, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases, to guarantee that the message is added to the stream, the producer must call `XADD` again with the same message. Without idempotent message processing, a retry may result in a message being delivered twice. With idempotent message processing, producers can guarantee at-most-once production even under such scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA unique ID, called an idempotent ID or *iid*, is associated with each message that is added to a stream. \\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to assign iids:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producers provide a unique iid for each message. An iid can be some identifier already associated with this message: a transaction ID, a counter, or a UUID.\\\\\\\\n1. Redis generates an iid based on each message’s content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the same message is added to the stream more than once, the same iid would need to be provided by the producer.\\\\\\\\nFor (1), this is the producer’s responsibility, and for (2), Redis will calculate the same iid, as long as the message content hasn’t changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the [`XADD`]() command with idempotency parameters, `IDMP` or `IDMPAUTO`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # producer-1 (pid) and iid-1 (iid) are provided manually\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value        # producer-2 (pid) is provided manually, Redis provides the iid\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_mOwtuqjrwIWQzoLCZsOpBK', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Based on the search results, I found information about Redis Streams, but the results focus more on idempotency and pipelining rather than the core message queuing functionality.

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream.

Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2

This feature enables reliable message submission with automatic deduplication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdempotent message processing ensures that handling the same message multiple times produces the same system state as handling it once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeginning with Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when producers resend messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProducers may need to resend messages under two scenarios:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producer-Redis network issues (disconnection and reconnection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If a disconnection occurs after the producer executes `XADD`, but before it receives the reply, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The producer crashes and restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If the producer crashes after calling `XADD` but before receiving the reply and marking a message as delivered, after a restart, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases, to guarantee that the message is added to the stream, the producer must call `XADD` again with the same message. Without idempotent message processing, a retry may result in a message being delivered twice. With idempotent message processing, producers can guarantee at-most-once production even under such scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA unique ID, called an idempotent ID or *iid*, is associated with each message that is added to a stream. \\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to assign iids:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producers provide a unique iid for each message. An iid can be some identifier already associated with this message: a transaction ID, a counter, or a UUID.\\\\\\\\n1. Redis generates an iid based on each message’s content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the same message is added to the stream more than once, the same iid would need to be provided by the producer.\\\\\\\\nFor (1), this is the producer’s responsibility, and for (2), Redis will calculate the same iid, as long as the message content hasn’t changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the [`XADD`]() command with idempotency parameters, `IDMP` or `IDMPAUTO`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # producer-1 (pid) and iid-1 (iid) are provided manually\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value        # producer-2 (pid) is provided manually, Redis provides the iid\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.3764,\\\\n

protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Let me search more specifically for Redis Streams introduction and basic usage documentation.')]"}, {"content":

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS` `ArrayBuffer`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can observe the streams which are tracked by our registered consumer using `TFUNCTION LIST` command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFUNCTION LIST

access to the Redis log files, `redis.log` is a good method to use when debugging. However, there is a drawback. Redis Cloud users do not have access to the Redis log files, and it\\'s pretty common that only system administrators have access to them on self-hosted installations. Fortunately, you can also use Redis pub/sub, which will be discussed in the next section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou don\\'t have to do anything special to use `redis.log`, as it\\'s always available. Here is an example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```javascript\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=lib\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerFunction(\\'hello\\', ()=> {\\\\\\\\n  redis.log(\\'Hello log\\')\\\\\\\\n  return \\'Hello from an external file\\'\\\\\\\\n})\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter loading the library and executing the function with `TFCALL`, you\\'ll see something like the following in your Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n45718:M 01 Nov 2023 07:02:40.593 * <redisgears_2> Hello log\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you don\\'t have access to your Redis database log files, you can use pub/sub. The following example demonstrates how to use the [client.call]() API to publish to a pub/sub channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```javascript\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=lib\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nconst logChannel = \\'tfLogChannel\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nfunction publog(client, message) {\\\\\\\\n  client.call(\\'publish\\', logChannel, message)\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerFunction(\\'tflog\\', (client) => {\\\\\\\\n  publog(client, \\'sample pub/sub log message\\')\\\\\\\\n  return \\'sample\\'\\\\\\\\n})\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nIn a CLI session, subscribe to the `tfLogChannel` channel and watch for messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```redis\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> subscribe tfLogChannel\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"subscribe\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"tfLogChannel\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\nReading messages... (press Ctrl-C to quit or any key to type command)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn another CLI session, load the library, replacing what was already there, and then call the new function:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```redis\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFCALL lib.tflog 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sample\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll see the following in the previous CLI session:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```redis\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"tfLogChannel\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sample pub/sub log message\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a downside to using pub/sub. Redis pub/sub provides at-most-once message delivery semantics, which means that once a message is sent, it won\\'t be sent again. So, if a message isn\\'t consumed, it\\'s gone forever. This is likely okay for debugging, but for the longer term, `redis.log` is the better solution for log persistence.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.9296,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"39de5f37\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"39de5f37-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.2-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisos 8.2 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Open Source 8.2 (August 2025) > Modules API\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 8.2 introduces major performance and memory footprint improvements, new commands, and command extensions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Streams - new commands: `XDELEX` and `XACKDEL`; extension to `XADD` and `XTRIM`.\\\\\\\\n- Bitmap - `BITOP`: new operators: `DIFF`, `DIFF1`, `ANDOR`, and `ONE`.\\\\\\\\n- Query Engine - new SVS-VAMANA vector index type which supports vector compression.\\\\\\\\n- More than 15 performance and resource utilization improvements.\\\\\\\\n- New metrics: per-slot usage metrics, key size distributions for basic data types, and more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Alpine and Debian Docker images - https://hub.docker.com/_/redis\\\\\\\\n- Install using snap - see https://github.com/redis/redis-snap\\\\\\\\n- Install using brew - see https://github.com/redis/homebrew-redis\\\\\\\\n- Install using RPM - see https://github.com/redis/redis-rpm\\\\\\\\n- Install using Debian APT - see https://github.com/redis/redis-debian\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish), 24.04 (Noble Numbat)\\\\\\\\n- Rocky Linux 8.10, 9.5\\\\\\\\n- AlmaLinux 8.10, 9.5\\\\\\\\n- Debian 12 (Bookworm)\\\\\\\\n- macOS 13 (Ventura), 14 (Sonoma), 15 (Sequoia)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- (CVE-2025-32023) Fix out-of-bounds write in `HyperLogLog` commands.\\\\\\\\n- (CVE-2025-48367) Retry accepting other connections even if the accepted connection reports an error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- [#14141](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14141) Keyspace notifications - new event types:\\\\\\\\n  - `OVERWRITTEN` - the value of a key is completely overwritten\\\\\\\\n  - `TYPE_CHANGED` - key type change\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- [#14162](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14162) Crash when using evport with I/O threads.\\\\\\\\n- [#14163](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14163) `EVAL` crash when error table is empty.\\\\\\\\n- [#14144](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14144) Vector sets - RDB format is not compatible with big endian machines.\\\\\\\\n- [#14165](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14165) Endless client blocking for blocking commands.\\\\\\\\n- [#14164](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14164) Prevent `CLIENT UNBLOCK` from unblocking `CLIENT PAUSE`.\\\\\\\\n- [#14216](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14216) TTL was not removed by the `SET` command.\\\\\\\\n- [#14224](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14224) `HINCRBYFLOAT` removes field expiration on replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- [#Q6430](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/6430) More compression variants for the SVS-VAMANA vector index.\\\\\\\\n- [#Q6535](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/6535) `SHARD_K_RATIO` parameter - favor network latency over accuracy for KNN vector query in a Redis cluster (unstable feature) (MOD-10359).\\\\\\\\n- [#14144](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14144) Vector set - improve RDB loading / RESTORE speed by storing the worst link info .\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- [#14051](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14051) `RedisModule_Get*`, `RedisModule_Set*` - allow modules to access Redis configurations.\\\\\\\\n- [#14114](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14114) `RM_UnsubscribeFromKeyspaceEvents` - unregister a module from specific keyspace notifications.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.299,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redistimeseries 1.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.0.0 (June 2019) > Features\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In RedisTimeSeries, we are introducing a new data type that uses chunks of memory of fixed size for time series samples, indexed by the same [Radix Tree implementation](https://github.com/antirez/rax) as Redis Streams.

For example, for a desired false positive rate of 0.1% (1 in 1000), error_rate should be set to 0.001.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the number of items you expect having in your filter in total and is trivial when you have a static set but it becomes more challenging when your set grows over time. It\\'s important to get the number right because if you **oversize** - you\\'ll end up wasting memory. If you **undersize**, the filter will fill up and a new one will have to be stacked on top of it (sub-filter stacking). In the cases when a filter consists of multiple sub-filters stacked on top of each other latency for adds stays the same, but the latency for presence checks increases. The reason for this is the way the checks work: a regular check would first be performed on the top (latest) filter and if a negative answer is returned the next one is checked and so on. That\\'s where the added latency comes from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding an item to a Bloom filter never fails due to the data structure \\\\\\\\\\\\\"filling up\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Instead, the error rate starts to grow. To keep the error close to the one set on filter initialization, the Bloom filter will auto-scale, meaning, when capacity is reached, an additional sub-filter will be created.  \\\\\\\\n The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by `EXPANSION`. If the number of items to be stored in the filter is unknown, we recommend that you use an expansion of 2 or more to reduce the number of sub-filters. Otherwise, we recommend that you use an expansion of 1 to reduce memory consumption. The default expansion value is 2. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n The filter will keep adding more hash functions for every new sub-filter in order to keep your desired error rate. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMaybe you\\'re wondering \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why would I create a smaller filter with a high expansion rate if I know I\\'m going to scale anyway?\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; the answer is: for cases where you need to keep many filters (let\\'s say a filter per user, or per product) and most of them will stay small, but some with more activity will have to scale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you know you\\'re not going to scale use the `NONSCALING` flag because that way the filter will use one hash function less. Just remember that if you ever do reach the initially assigned capacity - your error rate will start to grow.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.4508,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Open Source that enables you to check if an element is present in a set using a very small memory space of a fixed size.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInstead of storing all the items in a set, a Bloom Filter stores only the items\\' hashed representations, thus sacrificing some precision. The trade-off is that Bloom Filters are very space-efficient and fast.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Bloom filter can guarantee the absence of an item from a set, but it can only give an estimation about its presence. So when it responds that an item is not present in a set (a negative answer), you can be sure that indeed is the case. But one out of every N positive answers will be wrong. Even though it looks unusual at first glance, this kind of uncertainty still has its place in computer science. There are many cases out there where a negative answer will prevent more costly operations, for example checking if a username has been taken, if a credit card has been reported as stolen, if a user has already seen an ad and much more.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.6566,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Reserving Bloom filters > Total size of a Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The actual memory used by a Bloom filter is a function of the chosen error rate:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe optimal number of hash functions is `ceil(-ln(error_rate) / ln(2))`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe required number of bits per item, given the desired `error_rate` and the optimal number of hash functions, is `-ln(error_rate) / ln(2)^2`.

Hashes offer a middle ground with indexing support but simpler structure.\n\n**Atomic Operations:** JSON allows atomic operations on nested elements without retrieving/reserializing the entire object, which is more efficient than serializing JSON as a string.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md > Choose a data type > Documents]\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/use_cases.md]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/ram.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/document-database.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisjson/redisjson-2.0-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/use_cases.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["hash", "field", "integer", "geo"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/ram.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/document-database.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisjson/redisjson-2.0-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/use_cases.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "614d1391-be5c-4bdd-a79f-5cdb00dd448d", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "eb84c6fa-dcfa-4b94-92a8-2b1653720417", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information comparing Redis Hashes and JSON data types.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_0NolE5OEAilGSt0ikh8UCE', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Hashes vs JSON comparison when to use', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_DRqJQUkVga0dJdyLTyjs0l', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'Hash.*JSON|JSON.*Hash'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_0NolE5OEAilGSt0ikh8UCE', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.7747,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Compare data types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Choose a data type > Documents\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"You would normally store document data using the string, hash, or JSON\\\\\\\\ntypes.

For example, you can serialize JSON and save it in a Redis String.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, Redis JSON provides several benefits over this approach.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Access and retrieval of subvalues**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith JSON, you can get nested values without having to transmit the entire object over the network. Being able to access sub-objects can lead to greater efficiencies when you\\'re storing large JSON objects in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Atomic partial updates**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJSON allows you to atomically run operations like incrementing a value, adding, or removing elements from an array, append strings, and so on. To do the same with a serialized object, you have to retrieve and then reserialize the entire object, which can be expensive and also lack atomicity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Indexing and querying**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you store JSON objects as Redis strings, there\\'s no good way to query those objects. On the other hand, storing these objects as JSON using Redis Open Source lets you index and query them.

Instead of storing actual elements (which would require memory proportional to the number of items), it maintains a compact state that allows it to estimate unique counts.\n\n**Key characteristics**:\n- Uses up to 12 KB of memory maximum (or much less for smaller sets)\n- Provides a standard error rate of 0.81% (less than 1%)\n- Can estimate cardinality of sets with up to 2^64 members\n- Encoded as a Redis string internally\n\n## Basic operations\n\nThe API is conceptually similar to Redis Sets:\n\n- **PFADD**: Adds an item to the HyperLogLog (constant time/space)\n- **PFCOUNT**: Returns the estimated count of unique items (constant time/space)\n- **PFMERGE**: Combines multiple HyperLogLogs into one (O(n) where n = number of sketches)\n\n## Example\n\n```redis\n> PFADD bikes Hyperion Deimos Phobes Quaoar\n(integer) 1\n> PFCOUNT bikes\n(integer) 4\n> PFADD commuter_bikes Salacia Mimas Quaoar\n(integer) 1\n> PFMERGE all_bikes bikes commuter_bikes\nOK\n> PFCOUNT all_bikes\n(integer) 6\n```\n\n## Common use cases\n\n- Counting unique visitors to a web page (especially useful when storing IP addresses is restricted by privacy laws)\n- Tracking unique queries in a search form per day\n- Counting unique plays of songs/videos\n- Any scenario requiring unique counts at scale where approximate results are acceptable\n\n[来源:

The Redis implementation uses up to 12 KB of memory and provides a standard error rate of 0.81%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCounting unique items usually requires an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items you want to count, because you need\\\\\\\\nto remember the elements you have already seen in the past in order to avoid\\\\\\\\ncounting them multiple times. However, a set of algorithms exist that trade \\\\\\\\nmemory for precision: they return an estimated measure with a standard error, \\\\\\\\nwhich, in the case of the Redis implementation for HyperLogLog, is less than 1%.\\\\\\\\nThe magic of this algorithm is that you no longer need to use an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items counted, and instead can use a\\\\\\\\nconstant amount of memory; 12k bytes in the worst case, or a lot less if your\\\\\\\\nHyperLogLog (We\\'ll just call them HLL from now) has seen very few elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHLLs in Redis, while technically a different data structure, are encoded\\\\\\\\nas a Redis string, so you can call [`GET`]() to serialize a HLL, and [`SET`]()\\\\\\\\nto deserialize it back to the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConceptually the HLL API is like using Sets to do the same task.

From the `redis-cli`, run the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> RG.PYEXECUTE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GearsBuilder().run()\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis command doesn\\'t do much; it simply iterates over the keyspace. Let\\'s add a key and run it again:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> SET message \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello world\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> RG.PYEXECUTE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GearsBuilder().run()\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'event\\': None, \\'key\\': \\'message\\', \\'type\\': \\'string\\', \\'value\\': \\'hello world\\'}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ve added a single string, and you can see that this gears function processes it, even though it does nothing with the data. Let\\'s actually do something with the data. So first, we\\'ll add a few more strings:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud::6379> SET message:2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello galaxy\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> SET message:3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello universe\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe now have three strings in our database. Suppose we want to perform a unique word count on these strings. We can write a RedisGears function to do this just that. So open a file called `wordcount.py`, and add the following code:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```py\\\\\\\\ngb = GearsBuilder()\\\\\\\\ngb.map(lambda x: x[\\'value\\'])     # map each key object to its string value\\\\\\\\ngb.flatmap(lambda x: x.split())  # split each string into a list of words\\\\\\\\ngb.countby()                     # run a count-unique on these words\\\\\\\\ngb.run()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to load files into RedisGears. For production deployments, we recommend using the special [`gears-cli`](https://github.com/gears-project/gears-cli). However, for the purpose of this demonstration, the easiest way is to pass the filename through the `redis-cli` command, like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli rg.pyexecute \\\\\\\\\\\\\"`cat wordcount.py`\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'world\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'galaxy\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'hello\\', \\'value\\': 3}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'universe\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe results here show the number of occurrences of each word in all of our strings. So, we\\'ve effectively processed the data in our Redis database all at once, in a batch.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='HyperLogLog in Redis is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the cardinality (count of unique elements) of a set with remarkable space efficiency.\\n\\n## How it works\\n\\n**Core principle**: HyperLogLog trades perfect accuracy for efficient space utilization.

Lists）实现，元素按插入顺序排列\n- **Streams**: 使用固定大小的内存块（chunks）+ Radix Tree 索引，专为流式数据设计\n\n### 2. **消息队列能力**\n**Lists 的局限**：\n- 适合简单的栈和队列场景\n- 使用 `LPUSH`/`RPUSH` 添加，`LPOP`/`RPOP` 消费\n- 缺乏消费者组（Consumer Group）机制\n- 无法追踪消息处理状态\n\n**Streams 的优势**：\n- 提供完整的消息队列功能\n- 支持消费者组（Consumer Groups）\n- 可追踪消息处理状态（pending/acknowledged）\n- 支持消息去重（Idempotency）\n- 实时流式处理（real streaming API）\n\n### 3. **数据保留策略**\n- **Lists**: 按消息数量限制（capped stream）\n- **Streams**: 按时间窗口保留（retention policy in milliseconds），更适合时序数据\n\n### 4. **性能特点**\n- **Lists**: 头尾操作 O(1)，但按索引访问较慢\n- **Streams**: 使用 Radix Tree 索引，支持高效的范围查询和消费者组管理\n\n### 5. **使用场景**\n- **Lists**: 简单的后台任务队列、栈/队列操作\n- **Streams**: 复杂的消息队列、事件溯源、实时数据处理、需要消费者组协作的场景\n\n## 总结\n如果只需要简单的 FIFO 队列，Lists 足够；但如果需要消费者组、消息确认、去重、时间窗口保留等企业级消息队列特性，应该使用 Streams。\n\n---\n\n**来源**:\n- [redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md > Basic commands]\n-

Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2> {\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1657030402506\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"record\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo1\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]]}\\\\\\\\n2630021:M

`data` argument which pass to the stream consumer callback are in the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"<ms>\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<seq>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<stream name>\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream_name_raw\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<stream name as ArrayBuffer>\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"record\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\\n

],\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why the record is a list of touples and not an object is because the Redis Stream specifications allows duplicate keys.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotice that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS` `ArrayBuffer`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can observe the streams which are tracked by our registered consumer using `TFUNCTION LIST` command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFUNCTION LIST

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To communicate with the Redis server, Redis clients use a protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.5467,\\\\n

This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='根据检索结果，我来回答 Redis Lists 和 Streams 作为消息队列的区别：\\n\\n## 核心区别\\n\\n### 1. **数据结构实现**\\n- **Lists**: 基于链表（Linked Lists）实现，元素按插入顺序排列\\n- **Streams**: 使用固定大小的内存块（chunks）+ Radix Tree 索引，专为流式数据设计\\n\\n### 2. **消息队列能力**\\n**Lists 的局限**：\\n- 适合简单的栈和队列场景\\n- 使用 `LPUSH`/`RPUSH` 添加，`LPOP`/`RPOP` 消费\\n- 缺乏消费者组（Consumer Group）机制\\n- 无法追踪消息处理状态\\n\\n**Streams 的优势**：\\n- 提供完整的消息队列功能\\n- 支持消费者组（Consumer Groups）\\n- 可追踪消息处理状态（pending/acknowledged）\\n- 支持消息去重（Idempotency）\\n- 实时流式处理（real streaming API）\\n\\n### 3. **数据保留策略**\\n- **Lists**: 按消息数量限制（capped stream）\\n- **Streams**: 按时间窗口保留（retention policy in milliseconds），更适合时序数据\\n\\n### 4. **性能特点**\\n- **Lists**: 头尾操作 O(1)，但按索引访问较慢\\n- **Streams**: 使用 Radix Tree 索引，支持高效的范围查询和消费者组管理\\n\\n### 5. **使用场景**\\n- **Lists**: 简单的后台任务队列、栈/队列操作\\n- **Streams**: 复杂的消息队列、事件溯源、实时数据处理、需要消费者组协作的场景\\n\\n## 总结\\n如果只需要简单的 FIFO 队列，Lists 足够；但如果需要消费者组、消息确认、去重、时间窗口保留等企业级消息队列特性，应该使用 Streams。\\n\\n---\\n\\n**来源**:\\n- [redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md > Basic commands]\\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md > v1.0.0 Features]\\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/triggers/Stream_Triggers.md]')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "根据检索结果，我来回答 Redis Lists 和 Streams 作为消息队列的区别：\n\n## 核心区别\n\n### 1. **数据结构实现**\n- **Lists**: 基于链表（Linked Lists）实现，元素按插入顺序排列\n- **Streams**: 使用固定大小的内存块（chunks）+ Radix Tree 索引，专为流式数据设计\n\n### 2. **消息队列能力**\n**Lists 的局限**：\n- 适合简单的栈和队列场景\n- 使用 `LPUSH`/`RPUSH` 添加，`LPOP`/`RPOP` 消费\n- 缺乏消费者组（Consumer Group）机制\n- 无法追踪消息处理状态\n\n**Streams 的优势**：\n- 提供完整的消息队列功能\n- 支持消费者组（Consumer Groups）\n- 可追踪消息处理状态（pending/acknowledged）\n- 支持消息去重（Idempotency）\n- 实时流式处理（real streaming API）\n\n### 3. **数据保留策略**\n- **Lists**: 按消息数量限制（capped stream）\n- **Streams**: 按时间窗口保留（retention policy in milliseconds），更适合时序数据\n\n### 4. **性能特点**\n- **Lists**: 头尾操作 O(1)，但按索引访问较慢\n- **Streams**: 使用 Radix Tree 索引，支持高效的范围查询和消费者组管理\n\n### 5. **使用场景**\n- **Lists**: 简单的后台任务队列、栈/队列操作\n- **Streams**: 复杂的消息队列、事件溯源、实时数据处理、需要消费者组协作的场景\n\n## 总结\n如果只需要简单的 FIFO 队列，Lists 足够；但如果需要消费者组、消息确认、去重、时间窗口保留等企业级消息队列特性，应该使用 Streams。\n\n---\n\n**来源**:\n- [redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md > Basic commands]\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md > v1.0.0 Features]\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/triggers/Stream_Triggers.md]", "session_id": "27c8c391-8cd2-4cc3-abb6-c60af5b15336", "num_turns": 2, "duration_ms": 139528, "total_cost_usd": 0.05991025, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1413, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2827, "cache_read_input_tokens": 35353, "output_tokens": 700, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

You can operate on anything from unsigned 1-bit integers to signed 63-bit integers. These values are stored using binary-encoded Redis strings.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Atomic operations**: Bitfields support atomic read, write, and increment operations\n- **Flexible bit widths**: Work with integers of any bit length (1-63 bits)\n- **Multiple operations**: Can perform multiple operations in a single command\n- **Commands**: `BITFIELD` (read/write) and `BITFIELD_RO` (read-only variant)\n\n## When to Use Them\n\nBitfields are ideal for **managing counters and similar numerical values**, especially when you need to:\n\n1. **Store multiple related counters efficiently** in a single key\n2. **Perform atomic updates** on multiple counters simultaneously\n3. **Save memory** by using exact bit widths instead of full integers\n\n## Practical Example\n\nThe documentation provides a bicycle tracking example where each bike has two 32-bit counters: current price and number of owners.\n\n```\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats SET u32 #0 1000\n1) (integer) 0\n\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 -50 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 950\n2) (integer) 1\n\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 500 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats GET u32 #0 GET u32 #1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n```\n\nThis shows atomically updating price (offset #0) and owner count (offset #1) in a single operation.\n\n## Performance\n\n`BITFIELD` is O(n), where n is the number of counters accessed.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitfields.md > Performance]", "tools_used":

Redis data types are closely related to fundamental data structures and are exposed to the programmer as such, without additional abstraction layers.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can\\'t be larger than memory. Another advantage of\\\\\\\\nin-memory databases is that the memory representation of complex data structures\\\\\\\\nis much simpler to manipulate compared to the same data structures on disk, so\\\\\\\\nRedis can do a lot with little internal complexity. At the same time the\\\\\\\\ntwo on-disk storage formats (RDB and AOF) don\\'t need to be suitable for random\\\\\\\\naccess, so they are compact and always generated in an append-only fashion\\\\\\\\n(Even the AOF log rotation is an append-only operation, since the new version\\\\\\\\nis generated from the copy of data in memory). However this design also involves\\\\\\\\ndifferent challenges compared to traditional on-disk stores. Being the main data\\\\\\\\nrepresentation on memory, Redis operations must be carefully handled to make sure\\\\\\\\nthere is always an updated version of the data set on disk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An empty instance uses ~ 3MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 85MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 160 MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting your use case is trivial. Use the `redis-benchmark` utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the `INFO memory` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n64-bit systems will use considerably more memory than 32-bit systems to store the same keys, especially if the keys and values are small. This is because pointers take 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. But of course the advantage is that you can\\\\\\\\nhave a lot of memory in 64-bit systems, so in order to run large Redis servers a 64-bit system is more or less required. The alternative is sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past the Redis developers experimented with Virtual Memory and other systems in order to allow larger than RAM datasets, but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well: data served from memory, disk used for storage. So for now there are no plans to create an on disk backend for Redis. Most of what\\\\\\\\nRedis is, after all, a direct result of its current design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf your real problem is not the total RAM needed, but the fact that you need\\\\\\\\nto split your data set into multiple Redis instances, please read the\\\\\\\\n[partitioning page]() in this documentation for more info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Ltd., the company sponsoring Redis development, has developed a\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis on Flash\\\\\\\\\\\\\" solution that uses a mixed RAM/flash approach for\\\\\\\\nlarger data sets with a biased access pattern.

Here's how to work with geospatial data:\n\n## Storing Geospatial Data\n\nUse `GEOADD` to add locations with longitude and latitude coordinates:\n\n```redis\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.27652 37.805186 station:1\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2674626 37.8062344 station:2\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2469854 37.8104049 station:3\n```\n\n**Note:** Longitude comes before latitude in the command.\n\n## Querying Geospatial Data\n\nUse `GEOSEARCH` to find locations within a radius or bounding box:\n\n```redis\nGEOSEARCH bikes:rentable FROMLONLAT -122.2612767 37.7936847 BYRADIUS 5 km WITHDIST\n```\n\nThis returns locations within 5 km of the given coordinates, along with their distances:\n\n```\n1) 1) \"station:1\"\n   2) \"1.8523\"\n2) 1) \"station:2\"\n   2) \"1.4979\"\n3) 1) \"station:3\"\n   2) \"2.2441\"\n```\n\n## Use Cases\n\nGeospatial indexes are ideal for:\n- Finding nearby points within a given radius\n- Searching within bounding boxes\n- Building location-based features like \"find nearest bike rental stations\"\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Redis Geospatial Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qftiVQraxmI) video tutorial\n- [Redis University

This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process.

center)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern data centers have a lot of moving pieces, such as infrastructure (servers and networks) and software systems (applications and services) that need to be monitored around the clock.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Time Series allows you to plan for new resources upfront, optimize the utilization of existing resources, reconstruct the circumstances that led to outages, and identify application performance issues by analyzing and reporting on the following metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Maximum CPU utilization per server\\\\\\\\n- Maximum network latency between two services\\\\\\\\n- Average IO bandwidth utilization of a storage system\\\\\\\\n- 99th percentile of the response time of a specific application outages\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Weather analysis (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Time Series can be used to track environmental measurements such as the number of daily sunshine hours and hourly rainfall depth, over a period of many years. Seasonally, you can measure average rainfall depth, average daily temperature, and the maximum number of sunny hours per day, for example. Watch the increase of the maximum daily temperature over the years. Predict the expected temperature and rainfall depth in a specific location for a particular week of the year.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultiple time series can be collected, each for a different location. By utilizing secondary indexes, measurements can be aggregated over given geographical regions (e.g., minimal and maximal daily temperature in Europe) or over locations with specific attributes (e.g., average rainfall depth in mountainous regions).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample metrics include: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Rain (cm)\\\\\\\\n- Temperature (C)\\\\\\\\n- Sunny periods (h)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Analysis of the atmosphere (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe atmospheric concentration of CO2 is more important than ever before. Use TimeSeries to track average, maximum and minimum CO2 level per season and average yearly CO2 over the last decades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Concentration of CO2 (ppm)\\\\\\\\n- Location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Flight data recording (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlanes have a multitude of sensors. This sensor data is stored in a black box and also shared with external systems. TimeSeries can help you reconstruct the sequence of events over time, optimize operations and maintenance intervals, improve safety, and provide feedback to the equipment manufacturers about the part quality. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Altitude\\\\\\\\n- Flight path\\\\\\\\n- Engine temperature\\\\\\\\n- Level of vibrations\\\\\\\\n- Pressure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ship logbooks (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s very common to keep track of ship voyages via (digital) logbooks. Use TimeSeries to calculate optimal routes using these metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Wind (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Ocean conditions (classes)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (knots)\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Connected car (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern cars are exposing several metrics via a standard interface. Use TimeSeries to correlate average fuel consumption with the tire pressure, figure out how long to keep a car in the fleet, determine optimal maintenance intervals, and calculate tax savings by type of the road (taxable vs. nontaxable roads). Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Acceleration\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n- Fuel level (liter)\\\\\\\\n- Distances (km)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Tire pressure\\\\\\\\n- Distance until next maintenance check\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Smart metering (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern houses and facilities gather details about energy consumption/production. Use Redis Time Series to aggregate billing based on monthly consumption. Optimize the network by redirecting the energy delivery relative to the fluctuations in need. Provide recommendations on how to improve the energy consumption behavior. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Consumption per location\\\\\\\\n- Produced amount of electrical energy per location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Quality of service (telecom)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMobile phone usage is increasing, producing a natural growth that just correlates to the increasing number of cellphones. However, there might also be spikes that correlate with specific events (for example, more messages around world championships). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTelecom providers need to ensure that they are providing the necessary infrastructure to deliver the right quality of service. This includes using mini towers for short-term peaks. Use TimeSeries to correlate traffic peaks to specific events, load balance traffic over several towers or mini towers, and predictively plan the infrastructure. Metrics include the amount of traffic per tower.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Stock trading (finance)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStock trading is highly automated today. Algorithms, and not just human beings, are trading, from the amount of bids and asks for the trading of a stock to the extreme volumes of trades per second (millions of ops per second). Computer-driven trading requires millisecond response times. It\\'s necessary to keep a lot of data points within a very short period of time (for example, price fluctuations per second within a minute). In addition, the long-term history needs to be kept to make statements about trends or for regulatory purposes.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse Redis Time Series to identify correlations between the trading behavior and other events (for example, social network posts). Discover a developing market. Detect anomalies to discover insider trades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Exact time and order of a trade by itself\\\\\\\\n- Type of the event (trade/bid)\\\\\\\\n- The stock price\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7569,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redistimeseries 1.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.0.0 (June 2019) > Features > Integrations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If you want to keep all of your raw data points indefinitely, your data set will grow linearly over time. However, if your use case allows you to have less fine-grained data further back in time, downsampling can be applied. This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function. RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using Redis’ core data structures, you can only retrieve a time series by knowing the exact key holding the time series. Unfortunately, for many time series use cases (such as root cause analysis or monitoring), your application won’t know the exact key it’s looking for. These use cases typically want to query a set of time series that relate to each other in a couple of dimensions to extract the insight you need. You could create your own secondary index with core Redis data structures to help with this, but it would come with a high development cost and require you to manage edge cases to make sure the index is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries does this indexing for you based on `field value` pairs (a.k.a labels) you can add to each time series, and use to filter at query time (a full list of these filters is available in our documentation). Here’s an example of creating a time series with two labels (sensor_id and area_id are the fields with values 2 and 32 respectively) and a retention window of 60,000 milliseconds:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to query a time series, it’s cumbersome to stream all raw data points if you’re only interested in, say, an average over a given time interval. RedisTimeSeries follows the Redis philosophy to only transfer the minimum required data to ensure lowest latency. Below is an example of aggregation query over time buckets of 5,000 milliseconds with an aggregation function:  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.RANGE temperature:3:32 1548149180000 1548149210000 AGGREGATION avg 5000\\\\\\\\n1) 1) (integer) 1548149180000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"26.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) 1) (integer) 1548149185000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"27.399999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) 1) (integer) 1548149190000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"24.800000000000001\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) 1) (integer) 1548149195000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"23.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) 1) (integer) 1548149200000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"25.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) 1) (integer) 1548149205000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"28\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n7) 1) (integer) 1548149210000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"20\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries comes with several integrations into existing time series tools. One such integration is our [RedisTimeSeries adapter for Prometheus](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-redistimeseries-adapter), which keeps all your monitoring metrics inside RedisTimeSeries while leveraging the entire Prometheus ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, we also created direct integration for [Grafana](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/grafana-redistimeseries). [This repository](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-demos) contains a docker-compose setup of RedisTimeSeries, its remote write adaptor, Prometheus and Grafana.

All\\\\\\\\nthe elements outside the given range are removed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you\\'re adding bikes on the end of a list of repairs, but only\\\\\\\\nwant to worry about the 3 that have been on the list the longest:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs 0 2\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above [`LTRIM`]() command tells Redis to keep just list elements from index\\\\\\\\n0 to 2, everything else will be discarded. This allows for a very simple but\\\\\\\\nuseful pattern: doing a List push operation + a List trim operation together \\\\\\\\nto add a new element and discard elements exceeding a limit. Using \\\\\\\\n[`LTRIM`]() with negative indexes can then be used to keep only the 3 most recently added:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs -3 -1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above combination adds new elements and keeps only the 3\\\\\\\\nnewest elements into the list. With [`LRANGE`]() you can access the top items\\\\\\\\nwithout any need to remember very old data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: while [`LRANGE`]() is technically an O(N) command, accessing small ranges\\\\\\\\ntowards the head or the tail of the list is a constant time operation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.8369,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Client and Server roles in the Redis cluster protocol > Write safety\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster uses asynchronous replication between nodes, and **last failover wins** implicit merge function. This means that the last elected master dataset eventually replaces all the other replicas. There is always a window of time when it is possible to lose writes during partitions. However these windows are very different in the case of a client that is connected to the majority of masters, and a client that is connected to the minority of masters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster tries harder to retain writes that are performed by clients connected to the majority of masters, compared to writes performed in the minority side.\\\\\\\\nThe following are examples of scenarios that lead to loss of acknowledged\\\\\\\\nwrites received in the majority partitions during failures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A write may reach a master, but while the master may be able to reply to the client, the write may not be propagated to replicas via the asynchronous replication used between master and replica nodes. If the master dies without the write reaching the replicas, the write is lost forever if the master is unreachable for a long enough period that one of its replicas is promoted. This is usually hard to observe in the case of a total, sudden failure of a master node since masters try to reply to clients (with the acknowledge of the write) and replicas (propagating the write) at about the same time. However it is a real world failure mode.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Another theoretically possible failure mode where writes are lost is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A master is unreachable because of a partition.\\\\\\\\n* It gets failed over by one of its replicas.\\\\\\\\n* After some time it may be reachable again.\\\\\\\\n* A client with an out-of-date routing table may write to the old master before it is converted into a replica (of the new master) by the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second failure mode is unlikely to happen because master nodes unable to communicate with the majority of the other masters for enough time to be failed over will no longer accept writes, and when the partition is fixed writes are still refused for a small amount of time to allow other nodes to inform about configuration changes. This failure mode also requires that the client\\'s routing table has not yet been updated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWrites targeting the minority side of a partition have a larger window in which to get lost. For example, Redis Cluster loses a non-trivial number of writes on partitions where there is a minority of masters and at least one or more clients, since all the writes sent to the masters may potentially get lost if the masters are failed over in the majority side.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, for a master to be failed over it must be unreachable by the majority of masters for at least `NODE_TIMEOUT`, so if the partition is fixed before that time, no writes are lost. When the partition lasts for more than `NODE_TIMEOUT`, all the writes performed in the minority side up to that point may be lost. However the minority side of a Redis Cluster will start refusing writes as soon as `NODE_TIMEOUT` time has elapsed without contact with the majority, so there is a maximum window after which the minority becomes no longer available. Hence, no writes are accepted or lost after that time.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_uUT0x89MyJCtaGNV6JDzOj', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7623,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"608370db\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"608370db-009\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/timeseries/configuration.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration Parameters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Time series configuration parameters > RETENTION_POLICY / ts-retention-policy > Example\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Because the retention can be provided at different levels, the actual precedence of the retention is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

However, if your use case allows you to have less fine-grained data further back in time, downsampling can be applied. This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function. RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using Redis’ core data structures, you can only retrieve a time series by knowing the exact key holding the time series. Unfortunately, for many time series use cases (such as root cause analysis or monitoring), your application won’t know the exact key it’s looking for. These use cases typically want to query a set of time series that relate to each other in a couple of dimensions to extract the insight you need. You could create your own secondary index with core Redis data structures to help with this, but it would come with a high development cost and require you to manage edge cases to make sure the index is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries does this indexing for you based on `field value` pairs (a.k.a labels) you can add to each time series, and use to filter at query time (a full list of these filters is available in our documentation). Here’s an example of creating a time series with two labels (sensor_id and area_id are the fields with values 2 and 32 respectively) and a retention window of 60,000 milliseconds:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to query a time series, it’s cumbersome to stream all raw data points if you’re only interested in, say, an average over a given time interval. RedisTimeSeries follows the Redis philosophy to only transfer the minimum required data to ensure lowest latency. Below is an example of aggregation query over time buckets of 5,000 milliseconds with an aggregation function:  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.RANGE temperature:3:32 1548149180000 1548149210000 AGGREGATION avg 5000\\\\\\\\n1) 1) (integer) 1548149180000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"26.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) 1) (integer) 1548149185000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"27.399999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) 1) (integer) 1548149190000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"24.800000000000001\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) 1) (integer) 1548149195000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"23.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) 1) (integer) 1548149200000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"25.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) 1) (integer) 1548149205000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"28\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n7) 1) (integer) 1548149210000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"20\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries comes with several integrations into existing time series tools.

Top-K actually uses a hash table similar to CMS internally, but adds a min heap for tracking top items\n\n3. **Query results**: \n   - CMS: Query any element's estimated count\n   - Top-K: Only query if an element is in the top K, or list all top K items\n\n4. **Memory efficiency**: Top-K is more memory-efficient when you only care about the highest-frequency items, not all items\n\n5. **Use when**:\n   - CMS: You need frequency estimates for many/all elements, especially heavy hitters\n   - Top-K: You only need to know the K most frequent items\n\n[来源:

elements from a stream.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Highest-rank\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in this case means \\\\\\\\\\\\\"elements with a highest number or score attached to them\\\\\\\\\\\\\", where the score can be a count of how many times the element has appeared in the stream - thus making the data structure perfect for finding the elements with the highest frequency in a stream.\\\\\\\\nOne very common application is detecting network anomalies and DDoS attacks where Top K can answer the question: Is there a sudden increase in the flux of requests to the same address or from the same IP?\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Open Source implementation of Top-K is based on the [HeavyKeepers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong) algorithm presented by Junzhi Gong et al. It discards some older approaches like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"count-all\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"admit-all-count-some\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in favour of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**count-with-exponential-decay**\\\\\\\\\\\\\" strategy which is biased against mouse (small) flows and has a limited impact on elephant (large) flows. This implementation uses two data structures in tandem: a hash table that holds the probabilistic counts (much like the Count-Min Sketch), and a min heap that holds the `K` items with the highest counts. This ensures high accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms allowed, while keeping memory utilization to a fraction of what is typically required by a Sorted Set. It has the additional benefit of being able to get real time notifications when elements are added or removed from the Top K list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trending hashtags (social media platforms, news distribution networks)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What are the K hashtags people have mentioned the most in the last X hours? \\\\\\\\n- What are the K news with highest read/view count today? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData flow is the incoming social media posts from which you parse out the different hashtags. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`TOPK.LIST`]() command has a time complexity of `O(K*log(k))` so if `K` is small, there is no need to keep a separate set or sorted set of all the hashtags. You can query directly from the Top K itself.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.4181,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/count-min-sketch.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-min sketch\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-Min Sketch is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Open Source that can be used to estimate the frequency of events/elements in a stream of data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt uses a sub-linear space at the expense of over-counting some events due to collisions. It consumes a stream of events/elements and keeps estimated counters of their frequency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is very important to know that the results coming from a Count-Min sketch lower than a certain threshold (determined by the error_rate) should be ignored and often even approximated to zero. So Count-Min sketch is indeed a data-structure for counting frequencies of elements in a stream, but it\\'s only useful for higher counts. Very low counts should be ignored as noise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Products (retail, online shops)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers this question: What was the sales volume (on a certain day) for a product? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse one Count-Min sketch created per day (period). Every product sale goes into the CMS. The CMS give reasonably accurate results for the products that contribute the most toward the sales. Products with low percentage of the total sales are ignored.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAssume you select an error rate of 0.1% (0.001) with a certainty of 99.8% (0.998). This means you have an error probability of 0.02% (0.002). Your sketch strives to keep the error within 0.1% of the total count of all elements you\\'ve added. There\\'s a 0.02% chance the error might exceed this—like when an element below the threshold overlaps with one above it. When you add a few items to the CMS and evaluate their frequency, remember that in such a small sample, collisions are rare, as seen with other probabilistic data structures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INITBYPROB bikes:profit 0.001 0.002\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 100\\\\\\\\n(integer) 100\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 200 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 150\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n> CMS.QUERY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Terrible Bike Name\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 100\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INFO bikes:profit\\\\\\\\n1) width\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 2000\\\\\\\\n3) depth\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 9\\\\\\\\n5) count\\\\\\\\n6) (integer) 450\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.9105,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ede072de\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ede072de-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisbloom/redisbloom-2.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisbloom 2.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v2.0.0 (June 2019)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"RedisBloom v2.0.3 requires:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Minimum Redis compatibility version (database): 4.0.0\\\\\\\\n- Minimum Redis Enterprise Software version (cluster): 5.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Performance improvements:\\\\\\\\n    - #[95](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/95) Top-K - Reduce checks on heap, now only checks if item count is larger than minimum in heap.\\\\\\\\n    - #[95](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/95) Top-K - The power of decay was calculated every time.

It can be used to answer the following questions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What fraction of the values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- How many values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- Which value is smaller than _p_ percent of the values in the data stream? (what is the _p_-percentile value)?\\\\\\\\n- What is the mean value between the _p1_-percentile value and the _p2_-percentile value?\\\\\\\\n- What is the value of the _n_-th smallest / largest value in the data stream? (what is the value with [reverse] rank _n_)?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs for any other probabilistic data structures, t-digest requires sublinear space and has controllable space-accuracy tradeoffs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing t-digest is simple and straightforward:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Creating a sketch and adding observations**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.CREATE key [COMPRESSION compression]` initializes a new t-digest sketch (and errors if the key already exists). The `COMPRESSION` argument is used to specify the tradeoff between accuracy and memory consumption. The default is 100. Higher values mean more accuracy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.ADD key value...` adds new observations (floating-point values) to the sketch. You can repeat calling [TDIGEST.ADD]() whenever new observations are available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating fractions or ranks by values**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.CDF key value...` to retrieve, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **fraction** of (observations **smaller** than the given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.RANK key value...` is similar to [TDIGEST.CDF](), but used for estimating the number of observations instead of the fraction of observations. More accurately it returns, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **number** of (observations **smaller** than a given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  And lastly, `TDIGEST.REVRANK key value...` is similar to [TDIGEST.RANK](), but returns, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **number** of (observations **larger** than a given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating values by fractions or ranks**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.QUANTILE key fraction...` returns, for each input **fraction**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) that is **smaller** than the given fraction of observations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.BYRANK key rank...` returns, for each input **rank**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) with that rank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.BYREVRANK key rank...` returns, for each input **reverse rank**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) with that reverse rank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating trimmed mean**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.TRIMMED_MEAN key lowFraction highFraction` to retrieve an estimation of the mean value between the specified fractions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  This is especially useful for calculating the average value ignoring outliers. For example, calculating the average value between the 20th percentile and the 80th percentile.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Merging sketches**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Sometimes it is useful to merge sketches. For example, suppose we measure latencies for 3 servers, and we want to calculate the 90%, 95%, and 99% latencies for all the servers combined.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.MERGE destKey numKeys sourceKey... [COMPRESSION compression] [OVERRIDE]` merges multiple sketches into a single sketch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  If `destKey` does not exist, a new sketch is created.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  If `destKey` is an existing sketch, its values are merged with the values of the source keys. To override the destination key contents, use `OVERRIDE`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Retrieving sketch information**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.MIN` key and `TDIGEST.MAX key` to retrieve the minimal and maximal values in the sketch, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Both return NaN (Not a Number) when the sketch is empty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Both commands return accurate results and are equivalent to `TDIGEST.BYRANK key 0` and `TDIGEST.BYREVRANK key 0` respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.INFO key` to retrieve some additional information about the sketch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Resetting a sketch**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.RESET key` empties the sketch and reinitializes it.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6481,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Use cases\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the cardinality of a set, trading perfect accuracy for efficient space utilization. The Redis implementation uses up to 12 KB of memory and provides a standard error rate of 0.81%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCounting unique items usually requires an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items you want to count, because you need\\\\\\\\nto remember the elements you have already seen in the past in order to avoid\\\\\\\\ncounting them multiple times. However, a set of algorithms exist that trade \\\\\\\\nmemory for precision: they return an estimated measure with a standard error, \\\\\\\\nwhich, in the case of the Redis implementation for HyperLogLog, is less than 1%.\\\\\\\\nThe magic of this algorithm is that you no longer need to use an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items counted, and instead can use a\\\\\\\\nconstant amount of memory; 12k bytes in the worst case, or a lot less if your\\\\\\\\nHyperLogLog (We\\'ll just call them HLL from now) has seen very few elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHLLs in Redis, while technically a different data structure, are encoded\\\\\\\\nas a Redis string, so you can call [`GET`]() to serialize a HLL, and [`SET`]()\\\\\\\\nto deserialize it back to the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConceptually the HLL API is like using Sets to do the same task. You would\\\\\\\\n[`SADD`]() every observed element into a set, and would use [`SCARD`]() to check the\\\\\\\\nnumber of elements inside the set, which are unique since [`SADD`]() will not\\\\\\\\nre-add an existing element.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile you don\\'t really *add items* into an HLL, because the data structure\\\\\\\\nonly contains a state that does not include actual elements, the API is the\\\\\\\\nsame:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time you see a new element, you add it to the count with [`PFADD`]().\\\\\\\\n* When you want to retrieve the current approximation of unique elements added using the [`PFADD`]() command, you can use the [`PFCOUNT`]() command. If you need to merge two different HLLs, the [`PFMERGE`]() command is available. Since HLLs provide approximate counts of unique elements, the result of the merge will give you an approximation of the number of unique elements across both source HLLs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> PFADD bikes Hyperion Deimos Phoebe Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> PFADD commuter_bikes Salacia Mimas Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFMERGE all_bikes bikes commuter_bikes\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT all_bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome examples of use cases for this data structure is counting unique queries\\\\\\\\nperformed by users in a search form every day, number of unique visitors to a web page and other similar cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is also able to perform the union of HLLs, please check the\\\\\\\\n[full documentation]() for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Anonymous unique visits of a web page (SaaS, analytics tools)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- How many unique visits has this page had on this day? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have played this song? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have viewed this video? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nStoring the IP address or any other kind of personal identifier is against the law in some countries, which makes it impossible to get unique visitor statistics on your website.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne HyperLogLog is created per page (video/song) per period, and every IP/identifier is added to it on every visit.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4658,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1633ae9e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1633ae9e-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/cuckoo-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Cuckoo filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom vs. Cuckoo filters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Cuckoo filter, just like a Bloom filter, is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Open Source that enables you to check if an element is present in a set in a very fast and space efficient way, while also allowing for deletions and showing better performance than Bloom in some scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the Bloom filter is a bit array with flipped bits at positions decided by the hash function, a Cuckoo filter is an array of buckets, storing fingerprints of the values in one of the buckets at positions decided by the two hash functions.

Here's how it works:\n\n## Failover Process Overview\n\nRedis Sentinel provides **automatic failover** when a master instance fails. The process involves multiple Sentinel instances cooperating to detect failures and promote a replica to master.\n\n## Key Steps\n\n**1. Failure Detection (ODOWN State)**\n- Multiple Sentinels must agree that a master is unreachable\n- The **quorum** parameter defines how many Sentinels need to agree (e.g., if quorum=2, at least 2 Sentinels must detect the failure)\n- This agreement marks the master as **ODOWN** (Objectively Down), which triggers the failover\n\n**2. Leader Election & Authorization**\n- Once ODOWN is triggered, one Sentinel attempts to become the failover leader\n- This Sentinel must get authorization from a **majority** of all Sentinels (not just the quorum)\n- Example: With 5 Sentinels and quorum=2, only 2 need to detect the failure, but at least 3 must authorize the failover\n\n**3. Replica Selection**\nSentinel selects the best replica to promote based on:\n1. **Disconnection time** - Replicas disconnected too long are excluded\n2. **Replica priority** - Lower `replica-priority` values are preferred\n3. **Replication offset** - Replica with most data from master wins\n4. **Run ID** - Lexicographically smaller ID as tiebreaker\n\n**4. Reconfiguration**\n- The selected replica is promoted to master\n- Other replicas are reconfigured to replicate from the new master\n- Clients are notified of the new master address\n\n## Safety Guarantees\n\n- **No minority partition failover**: Sentinel never starts a failover if the majority of Sentinel processes cannot communicate\n- **Quorum tuning**: Lower quorum = more sensitive to failures; higher quorum = requires stronger consensus\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Sentinel as a distributed system, Quorum, Replica selection and priority]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "failover", "master", "replication", "replica", "OBJECT", "MULTI"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "49269a49-4a8b-4a3d-9c27-582cdc2013c0", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "e16f896f-b40c-4980-8e38-bd21eff52a75", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Redis Sentinel's automatic failover handling.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_OAjBJAO5w4GAC8ojMl7VJu', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Sentinel automatic failover process', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_eqVgDuK3DvxrUfkktR5h9u', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'Sentinel.*failover|automatic failover'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_OAjBJAO5w4GAC8ojMl7VJu', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.726,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis service discovery via Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel is a monitoring solution for Redis instances that handles\\\\\\\\nautomatic failover of Redis masters and service discovery (who is the current\\\\\\\\nmaster for a given group of instances?).

However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel.

Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties.

There is no\\\\\\\\nneed to specify replicas, which are auto-discovered. Sentinel will update the\\\\\\\\nconfiguration automatically with additional information about replicas (in\\\\\\\\norder to retain the information in case of restart). The configuration is\\\\\\\\nalso rewritten every time a replica is promoted to master during a failover\\\\\\\\nand every time a new Sentinel is discovered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe example configuration above basically monitors two sets of Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances, each composed of a master and an undefined number of replicas.\\\\\\\\nOne set of instances is called `mymaster`, and the other `resque`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe meaning of the arguments of `sentinel monitor` statements is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <port> <quorum>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the sake of clarity, let\\'s check line by line what the configuration\\\\\\\\noptions mean:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first line is used to tell Redis to monitor a master called *mymaster*,\\\\\\\\nthat is at address 127.0.0.1 and port 6379, with a quorum of 2. Everything\\\\\\\\nis pretty obvious but the **quorum** argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The **quorum** is the number of Sentinels that need to agree about the fact the master is not reachable, in order to really mark the master as failing, and eventually start a failover procedure if possible.\\\\\\\\n* However **the quorum is only used to detect the failure**. In order to actually perform a failover, one of the Sentinels need to be elected leader for the failover and be authorized to proceed. This only happens with the vote of the **majority of the Sentinel processes**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example if you have 5 Sentinel processes, and the quorum for a given\\\\\\\\nmaster set to the value of 2, this is what happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If two Sentinels agree at the same time about the master being unreachable, one of the two will try to start a failover.\\\\\\\\n* If there are at least a total of three Sentinels reachable, the failover will be authorized and will actually start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn practical terms this means during failures **Sentinel never starts a failover if the majority of Sentinel processes are unable to talk** (aka no failover in the minority partition).\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8874,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-025\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Algorithms and internals > Quorum\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The previous sections showed that every master monitored by Sentinel is associated to a configured **quorum**. It specifies the number of Sentinel processes\\\\\\\\nthat need to agree about the unreachability or error condition of the master in\\\\\\\\norder to trigger a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, after the failover is triggered, in order for the failover to actually be performed, **at least a majority of Sentinels must authorize the Sentinel to\\\\\\\\nfailover**. Sentinel never performs a failover in the partition where a\\\\\\\\nminority of Sentinels exist.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s try to make things a bit more clear:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Quorum: the number of Sentinel processes that need to detect an error condition in order for a master to be flagged as **ODOWN**.\\\\\\\\n* The failover is triggered by the **ODOWN** state.\\\\\\\\n* Once the failover is triggered, the Sentinel trying to failover is required to ask for authorization to a majority of Sentinels (or more than the majority if the quorum is set to a number greater than the majority).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe difference may seem subtle but is actually quite simple to understand and use.  For example if you have 5 Sentinel instances, and the quorum is set to 2, a failover will be triggered as soon as 2 Sentinels believe that the master is not reachable, however one of the two Sentinels will be able to failover only if it gets authorization at least from 3 Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf instead the quorum is configured to 5, all the Sentinels must agree about the master error condition, and the authorization from all Sentinels is required in order to failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that the quorum can be used to tune Sentinel in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. If a quorum is set to a value smaller than the majority of Sentinels we deploy, we are basically making Sentinel more sensitive to master failures, triggering a failover as soon as even just a minority of Sentinels is no longer able to talk with the master.\\\\\\\\n2. If a quorum is set to a value greater than the majority of Sentinels, we are making Sentinel able to failover only when there are a very large number (larger than majority) of well connected Sentinels which agree about the master being down.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.5916,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-023\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > Replica selection and priority\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When a Sentinel instance is ready to perform a failover, since the master\\\\\\\\nis in `ODOWN` state and the Sentinel received the authorization to failover\\\\\\\\nfrom the majority of the Sentinel instances known, a suitable replica needs\\\\\\\\nto be selected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe replica selection process evaluates the following information about replicas:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

slot（哈希槽）** 机制进行分片。\n\n### Hash Slot 核心概念\n\n- Redis Cluster 将整个键空间划分为 **16384 个 hash slots**\n- 每个 master 节点负责其中一部分 hash slots\n- 键到 hash slot 的映射算法：`HASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384`\n\n**示例：3 节点集群的 slot 分配**\n```\nNode A: hash slots 0-5500\nNode B: hash slots 5501-11000  \nNode C: hash slots 11001-16383\n```\n\n### CRC16 算法规格\n- 名称: XMODEM (也称 ZMODEM 或 CRC-16/ACORN)\n- 宽度: 16 bit\n- 多项式: 1021 (x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\n- 使用 14 位输出（因此需要 mod 16384）\n\n## Hash Tags（哈希标签）\n\n为了支持多键操作，Redis Cluster 提供了 **hash tags** 机制，确保多个键分配到同一个 hash slot：\n\n**规则**：如果键包含 `{...}` 模式，只对大括号内的子串进行哈希计算\n\n**示例**：\n- `{user1000}.following` 和 `{user1000}.followers` → 只对 `user1000` 哈希，保证在同一 slot\n- `user:{123}:profile` 和 `user:{123}:account` → 只对 `123` 哈希，可在同一事务中操作\n\n## 动态扩缩容\n\n添加/删除节点本质上是 **移动 hash slots**：\n\n- **添加节点 D**：从 A、B、C 各移动部分 slots 到 D\n- **删除节点 A**：将 A 的 slots 移动到 B、C\n- **重新平衡**：在节点间移动 slots 调整负载\n\n**关键特性**：移动 hash slots 不需要停机，支持在线操作。\n\n## Slot 配置传播\n\n集群通过两种方式传播 slot 配置：\n\n1. **心跳消息**：每个 ping/pong 包都包含节点负责的 hash slots 信息\n2. **UPDATE 消息**：当节点发现对方信息过时，主动发送更新\n\n**配置更新规则**：\n- Rule 1: 未分配的 slot，接受第一个声明者\n- Rule 2: 已分配的 slot，接受 `configEpoch` 更大的声明者（**last failover wins**）\n\n这确保了故障转移后，所有节点最终会一致认为拥有最大 `configEpoch` 的节点是 slot 的所有者。\n\n---\n\n**[来源]**:\n-

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"An important part of Redis Cluster is the mechanism used to propagate the information about which cluster node is serving a given set of hash slots. This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.8117,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Hash tags\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"There is an exception for the computation of the hash slot that is used in order\\\\\\\\nto implement **hash tags**. Hash tags are a way to ensure that multiple keys\\\\\\\\nare allocated in the same hash slot. This is used in order to implement\\\\\\\\nmulti-key operations in Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo implement hash tags, the hash slot for a key is computed in a\\\\\\\\nslightly different way in certain conditions.\\\\\\\\nIf the key contains a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{...}\\\\\\\\\\\\\" pattern only the substring between\\\\\\\\n`{` and `}` is hashed in order to obtain the hash slot. However since it is\\\\\\\\npossible that there are multiple occurrences of `{` or `}` the algorithm is\\\\\\\\nwell specified by the following rules:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* IF the key contains a `{` character.\\\\\\\\n* AND IF there is a `}` character to the right of `{`.\\\\\\\\n* AND IF there are one or more characters between the first occurrence of `{` and the first occurrence of `}`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen instead of hashing the key, only what is between the first occurrence of `{` and the following first occurrence of `}` is hashed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExamples:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The two keys `{user1000}.following` and `{user1000}.followers` will hash to the same hash slot since only the substring `user1000` will be hashed in order to compute the hash slot.\\\\\\\\n* For the key `foo{}{bar}` the whole key will be hashed as usual since the first occurrence of `{` is followed by `}` on the right without characters in the middle.\\\\\\\\n* For the key `foo{{bar}}zap` the substring `{bar` will be hashed, because it is the substring between the first occurrence of `{` and the first occurrence of `}` on its right.\\\\\\\\n* For the key `foo{bar}{zap}` the substring `bar` will be hashed, since the algorithm stops at the first valid or invalid (without bytes inside) match of `{` and `}`.\\\\\\\\n* What follows from the algorithm is that if the key starts with `{}`, it is guaranteed to be hashed as a whole. This is useful when using binary data as key names.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.3744,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster 101 > Redis Cluster master-replica model\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster does not use consistent hashing, but a different form of sharding\\\\\\\\nwhere every key is conceptually part of what we call a **hash slot**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute the hash\\\\\\\\nslot for a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo\\\\\\\\n16384.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,\\\\\\\\nso, for example, you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.\\\\\\\\n* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.\\\\\\\\n* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes it easy to add and remove cluster nodes. For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.5445,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > Live reconfiguration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster supports the ability to add and remove nodes while the cluster\\\\\\\\nis running. Adding or removing a node is abstracted into the same\\\\\\\\noperation: moving a hash slot from one node to another. This means\\\\\\\\nthat the same basic mechanism can be used in order to rebalance the cluster, add\\\\\\\\nor remove nodes, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To add a new node to the cluster an empty node is added to the cluster and some set of hash slots are moved from existing nodes to the new node.\\\\\\\\n* To remove a node from the cluster the hash slots assigned to that node are moved to other existing nodes.\\\\\\\\n* To rebalance the cluster a given set of hash slots are moved between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe core of the implementation is the ability to move hash slots around.\\\\\\\\nFrom a practical point of view a hash slot is just a set of keys, so\\\\\\\\nwhat Redis Cluster really does during *resharding* is to move keys from\\\\\\\\nan instance to another instance. Moving a hash slot means moving all the keys\\\\\\\\nthat happen to hash into this hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo understand how this works we need to show the [`CLUSTER`](/commands/cluster) subcommands\\\\\\\\nthat are used to manipulate the slots translation table in a Redis Cluster node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following subcommands are available (among others not useful in this case):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-delslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-addslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-delslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot NODE node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot MIGRATING node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot IMPORTING node\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first four commands, `ADDSLOTS`, `DELSLOTS`, `ADDSLOTSRANGE` and `DELSLOTSRANGE`, are simply used to assign\\\\\\\\n(or remove) slots to a Redis node. Assigning a slot means to tell a given\\\\\\\\nmaster node that it will be in charge of storing and serving content for\\\\\\\\nthe specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the hash slots are assigned they will propagate across the cluster\\\\\\\\nusing the gossip protocol, as specified later in the\\\\\\\\n*configuration propagation* section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `ADDSLOTS` and `ADDSLOTSRANGE` commands are usually used when a new cluster is created\\\\\\\\nfrom scratch to assign each master node a subset of all the 16384 hash\\\\\\\\nslots available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `DELSLOTS`  and `DELSLOTSRANGE` are mainly used for manual modification of a cluster configuration\\\\\\\\nor for debugging tasks: in practice it is rarely used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `SETSLOT` subcommand is used to assign a slot to a specific node ID if\\\\\\\\nthe `SETSLOT <slot> NODE` form is used. Otherwise the slot can be set in the\\\\\\\\ntwo special states `MIGRATING` and `IMPORTING`. Those two special states\\\\\\\\nare used in order to migrate a hash slot from one node to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as MIGRATING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the key in question\\\\\\\\nexists, otherwise the query is forwarded using a `-ASK` redirection to the\\\\\\\\nnode that is target of the migration.\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as IMPORTING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the request is\\\\\\\\npreceded by an [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command. If the [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command was not given\\\\\\\\nby the client, the query is redirected to the real hash slot owner via\\\\\\\\na `-MOVED` redirection error, as would happen normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s make this clearer with an example of hash slot migration.\\\\\\\\nAssume that we have two Redis master nodes, called A and B.\\\\\\\\nWe want to move hash slot 8 from A to B, so we issue commands like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We send B: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 IMPORTING A\\\\\\\\n* We send A: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 MIGRATING B\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll the other nodes will continue to point clients to node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" every time\\\\\\\\nthey are queried with a key that belongs to hash slot 8, so what happens\\\\\\\\nis that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* All queries about existing keys are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* All queries about non-existing keys in A are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\", because \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will redirect clients to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis way we no longer create new keys in \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\nIn the meantime, `redis-cli` used during reshardings\\\\\\\\nand Redis Cluster configuration will migrate existing keys in\\\\\\\\nhash slot 8 from A to B.\\\\\\\\nThis is performed using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT slot count\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will return `count` keys in the specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\nFor keys returned, `redis-cli` sends node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) command, that\\\\\\\\nwill migrate the specified keys from A to B in an atomic way (both instances\\\\\\\\nare locked for the time (usually very small time) needed to migrate keys so\\\\\\\\nthere are no race conditions). This is how [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    MIGRATE target_host target_port \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\" target_database id timeout KEYS key1 key2 ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) will connect to the target instance, send a serialized version of\\\\\\\\nthe key, and once an OK code is received, the old key from its own dataset\\\\\\\\nwill be deleted. From the point of view of an external client a key exists\\\\\\\\neither in A or B at any given time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis Cluster there is no need to specify a database other than 0, but\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is a general command that can be used for other tasks not\\\\\\\\ninvolving Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is optimized to be as fast as possible even when moving complex\\\\\\\\nkeys such as long lists, but in Redis Cluster reconfiguring the\\\\\\\\ncluster where big keys are present is not considered a wise procedure if\\\\\\\\nthere are latency constraints in the application using the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the migration process is finally finished, the `SETSLOT <slot> NODE <node-id>` command is sent to the two nodes involved in the migration in order to\\\\\\\\nset the slots to their normal state again. The same command is usually\\\\\\\\nsent to all other nodes to avoid waiting for the natural\\\\\\\\npropagation of the new configuration across the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n

Redis provides a range of persistence options. These include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RDB** (Redis Database): RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.\\\\\\\\n* **AOF** (Append Only File): AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server. These operations can then be replayed again at server startup, reconstructing the original dataset. Commands are logged using the same format as the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n* **No persistence**: You can disable persistence completely. This is sometimes used when caching.\\\\\\\\n* **RDB + AOF**: You can also combine both AOF and RDB in the same instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\'d rather not think about the tradeoffs between these different persistence strategies, you may want to consider [Redis Software\\'s persistence options](), which can be pre-configured using a UI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about how to evaluate your Redis persistence strategy, read on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is a very compact single-file point-in-time representation of your Redis data. RDB files are perfect for backups. For instance you may want to archive your RDB files every hour for the latest 24 hours, and to save an RDB snapshot every day for 30 days. This allows you to easily restore different versions of the data set in case of disasters.\\\\\\\\n* RDB is very good for disaster recovery, being a single compact file that can be transferred to far data centers, or onto Amazon S3 (possibly encrypted).\\\\\\\\n* RDB maximizes Redis performances since the only work the Redis parent process needs to do in order to persist is forking a child that will do all the rest. The parent process will never perform disk I/O or alike.\\\\\\\\n* RDB allows faster restarts with big datasets compared to AOF.\\\\\\\\n* On replicas, RDB supports [partial resynchronizations after restarts and failovers]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is NOT good if you need to minimize the chance of data loss in case Redis stops working (for example after a power outage). You can configure different *save points* where an RDB is produced (for instance after at least five minutes and 100 writes against the data set, you can have multiple save points). However you\\'ll usually create an RDB snapshot every five minutes or more, so in case of Redis stopping working without a correct shutdown for any reason you should be prepared to lose the latest minutes of data.\\\\\\\\n* RDB needs to fork() often in order to persist on disk using a child process. fork() can be time consuming if the dataset is big, and may result in Redis stopping serving clients for some milliseconds or even for one second if the dataset is very big and the CPU performance is not great. AOF also needs to fork() but less frequently and you can tune how often you want to rewrite your logs without any trade-off on durability.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8847,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Append-only file > How I can switch to AOF, if I\\'m currently using dump.rdb snapshots?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If you want to enable AOF in a server that is currently using RDB snapshots, you need to convert the data by enabling AOF via CONFIG command on the live server first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT:** not following this procedure (e.g. just changing the config and restarting the server) can result in data loss!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis >= 2.2**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreparations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Make a backup of your latest dump.rdb file.\\\\\\\\n* Transfer this backup to a safe place.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSwitch to AOF on live database:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Enable AOF: `redis-cli config set appendonly yes`\\\\\\\\n* Optionally disable RDB: `redis-cli config set save \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`\\\\\\\\n* Make sure writes are appended to the append only file correctly.\\\\\\\\n* **IMPORTANT:** Update your `redis.conf` (potentially through [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite)) and ensure that it matches the configuration above.\\\\\\\\n  If you forget this step, when you restart the server, the configuration changes will be lost and the server will start again with the old configuration, resulting in a loss of your data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext time you restart the server:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Before restarting the server, wait for AOF rewrite to finish persisting the data.\\\\\\\\n  You can do that by watching `INFO persistence`, waiting for `aof_rewrite_in_progress` and `aof_rewrite_scheduled` to be `0`, and validating that `aof_last_bgrewrite_status` is `ok`.\\\\\\\\n* After restarting the server, check that your database contains the same number of keys it contained previously.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis 2.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Make a backup of your latest dump.rdb file.\\\\\\\\n* Transfer this backup into a safe place.\\\\\\\\n* Stop all the writes against the database!\\\\\\\\n* Issue a `redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF`.

This is what we suggest:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Create a cron job in your server creating hourly snapshots of the RDB file in one directory, and daily snapshots in a different directory.\\\\\\\\n* Every time the cron script runs, make sure to call the `find` command to make sure too old snapshots are deleted: for instance you can take hourly snapshots for the latest 48 hours, and daily snapshots for one or two months. Make sure to name the snapshots with date and time information.\\\\\\\\n* At least one time every day make sure to transfer an RDB snapshot *outside your data center* or at least *outside the physical machine* running your Redis instance.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.2302,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"AOF disadvantages\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Using AOF Redis is much more durable: you can have different fsync policies: no fsync at all, fsync every second, fsync at every query. With the default policy of fsync every second, write performance is still great. fsync is performed using a background thread and the main thread will try hard to perform writes when no fsync is in progress, so you can only lose one second worth of writes.\\\\\\\\n* The AOF log is an append-only log, so there are no seeks, nor corruption problems if there is a power outage. Even if the log ends with a half-written command for some reason (disk full or other reasons) the redis-check-aof tool is able to fix it easily.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is able to automatically rewrite the AOF in background when it gets too big. The rewrite is completely safe as while Redis continues appending to the old file, a completely new one is produced with the minimal set of operations needed to create the current data set, and once this second file is ready Redis switches the two and starts appending to the new one.\\\\\\\\n* AOF contains a log of all the operations one after the other in an easy to understand and parse format. You can even easily export an AOF file. For instance even if you\\'ve accidentally flushed everything using the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command, as long as no rewrite of the log was performed in the meantime, you can still save your data set just by stopping the server, removing the latest command, and restarting Redis again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF files are usually bigger than the equivalent RDB files for the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n* AOF can be slower than RDB depending on the exact fsync policy. In general with fsync set to *every second* performance is still very high, and with fsync disabled it should be exactly as fast as RDB even under high load. Still RDB is able to provide more guarantees about the maximum latency even in the case of a huge write load.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis < 7.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF can use a lot of memory if there are writes to the database during a rewrite (these are buffered in memory and written to the new AOF at the end).\\\\\\\\n* All write commands that arrive during rewrite are written to disk twice.\\\\\\\\n* Redis could freeze writing and fsyncing these write commands to the new AOF file at the end of the rewrite.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nOk, so what should I use?\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe general indication you should use both persistence methods is if\\\\\\\\nyou want a degree of data safety comparable to what PostgreSQL can provide you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you care a lot about your data, but still can live with a few minutes of\\\\\\\\ndata loss in case of disasters, you can simply use RDB alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are many users using AOF alone, but we discourage it since to have an\\\\\\\\nRDB snapshot from time to time is a great idea for doing database backups,\\\\\\\\nfor faster restarts, and in the event of bugs in the AOF engine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following sections will illustrate a few more details about the two persistence models.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8067,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis FAQ\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Why does Redis keep its entire dataset in memory?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Redis has a different evolution path in the key-value DBs where values can contain more complex data types, with atomic operations defined on those data types. Redis data types are closely related to fundamental data structures and are exposed to the programmer as such, without additional abstraction layers.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can\\'t be larger than memory. Another advantage of\\\\\\\\nin-memory databases is that the memory representation of complex data structures\\\\\\\\nis much simpler to manipulate compared to the same data structures on disk, so\\\\\\\\nRedis can do a lot with little internal complexity. At the same time the\\\\\\\\ntwo on-disk storage formats (RDB and AOF) don\\'t need to be suitable for random\\\\\\\\naccess, so they are compact and always generated in an append-only fashion\\\\\\\\n(Even the AOF log rotation is an append-only operation, since the new version\\\\\\\\nis generated from the copy of data in memory). However this design also involves\\\\\\\\ndifferent challenges compared to traditional on-disk stores. Being the main data\\\\\\\\nrepresentation on memory, Redis operations must be carefully handled to make sure\\\\\\\\nthere is always an updated version of the data set on disk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An empty instance uses ~ 3MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 85MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 160 MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting your use case is trivial. Use the `redis-benchmark` utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the `INFO memory` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n64-bit systems will use considerably more memory than 32-bit systems to store the same keys, especially if the keys and values are small. This is because pointers take 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. But of course the advantage is that you can\\\\\\\\nhave a lot of memory in 64-bit systems, so in order to run large Redis servers a 64-bit system is more or less required. The alternative is sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past the Redis developers experimented with Virtual Memory and other systems in order to allow larger than RAM datasets, but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well: data served from memory, disk used for storage. So for now there are no plans to create an on disk backend for Redis. Most of what\\\\\\\\nRedis is, after all, a direct result of its current design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf your real problem is not the total RAM needed, but the fact that you need\\\\\\\\nto split your data set into multiple Redis instances, please read the\\\\\\\\n[partitioning page]() in this documentation for more info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Ltd., the company sponsoring Redis development, has developed a\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis on Flash\\\\\\\\\\\\\" solution that uses a mixed RAM/flash approach for\\\\\\\\nlarger data sets with a biased access pattern.

{"test_id": "redis-ops-004", "category": "redis-ops", "type": "unknown", "source": "qdrant", "query": "How to configure Redis ACL for fine-grained access control?", "status": "passed", "elapsed_seconds": 98.82779932022095, "cost_usd": 0.056177, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 2301, "answer": "Redis ACL (Access Control List) provides fine-grained access control by limiting commands and keys that connections can access. Here's how to configure it:\n\n## Basic Configuration\n\nRedis ACL uses a DSL (domain specific language) to define user permissions. You can configure ACLs in two ways:\n\n1. **Directly in redis.conf**:\n```\nuser <username> ... acl rules ...\n```\n\n2. **External ACL file** (recommended for complex environments):\n```\naclfile /etc/redis/users.acl\n```\n\n## ACL Rule Syntax\n\nRules are applied left-to-right. Example:\n```\nuser worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99\n```\n\nKey components:\n- `on/off` - Enable/disable the user\n- `>password` - Set password\n- `~<pattern>` - Key access patterns (e.g., `~*` for all keys, `~jobs:*` for specific prefix)\n- `&<pattern>` - Pub/Sub channel access\n- `+@<category>` - Allow command categories\n- `+<command>` - Allow specific commands\n\n## Authentication\n\nRedis 6+ supports two AUTH formats:\n```\nAUTH <username> <password>\nAUTH <password>  # Uses \"default\" user for backward compatibility\n```\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n**1. Read-only user:**\n```\nACL SETUSER readonly on >password ~* +@read\n```\n\n**2. Worker with limited access:**\n```\nuser worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99\n```\n\n**3. Sentinel user:**\n```\nACL SETUSER sentinel-user on >somepassword allchannels +multi +slaveof +ping +exec +subscribe +config|rewrite +role +publish +info +client|setname +client|kill +script|kill\n```\n\n**4. Replica user:**\n```\nACL setuser replica-user on >somepassword +psync +replconf +ping\n```\n\n## Managing ACLs\n\n- **View current ACLs**: `ACL LIST`\n- **Reload from file**: `ACL LOAD` (only if all users are valid)\n- **Save to file**: `ACL SAVE`\n- **Rewrite config**: `CONFIG REWRITE` (for redis.conf users)\n\nNote: `CONFIG REWRITE` doesn't trigger `ACL SAVE` - they're handled separately.\n\n## Security Benefits\n\n1. **Restrict untrusted clients** - Limit access to read-only commands or specific keys\n2. **Operational safety** - Prevent accidental data loss (e.g., block FLUSHALL for workers)\n3. **Multi-tenancy** - Isolate customers in managed Redis environments\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md > Configure ACL with the ACL command, ACL rules for Sentinel and Replicas]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "ACL", "user", "permission", "replica", "PSYNC", "MULTI", "EXEC", "script"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "430695f6-2fe1-46a0-aeae-8fb9833cfab6", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "ae88105a-1de8-488b-b01d-2904de2ed88c", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis ACL configuration for fine-grained access control.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_coL9jLRgvOdgmMdAhTz7Iu', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis ACL fine-grained access control configuration', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_KLdwUqmQFelW45bKu4Tb1n', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'ACL|access control'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_coL9jLRgvOdgmMdAhTz7Iu', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.6987,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ACL\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"When ACLs are useful\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis ACL, short for Access Control List, is the feature that allows certain\\\\\\\\nconnections to be limited in terms of the commands that can be executed and the\\\\\\\\nkeys that can be accessed. The way it works is that, after connecting, a client\\\\\\\\nis required to provide a username and a valid password to authenticate. If authentication succeeded, the connection is associated with a given\\\\\\\\nuser and the limits the user has. Redis can be configured so that new\\\\\\\\nconnections are already authenticated with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\" user (this is the\\\\\\\\ndefault configuration). Configuring the default user has, as a side effect,\\\\\\\\nthe ability to provide only a specific subset of functionalities to connections\\\\\\\\nthat are not explicitly authenticated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the default configuration, Redis 6 (the first version to have ACLs) works\\\\\\\\nexactly like older versions of Redis. Every new connection is\\\\\\\\ncapable of calling every possible command and accessing every key, so the\\\\\\\\nACL feature is backward compatible with old clients and applications. Also\\\\\\\\nthe old way to configure a password, using the **requirepass** configuration\\\\\\\\ndirective, still works as expected. However, it now\\\\\\\\nsets a password for the default user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command was extended in Redis 6, so now it is possible to\\\\\\\\nuse it in the two-arguments form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <username> <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of the old form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat happens is that the username used to authenticate is \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so\\\\\\\\njust specifying the password implies that we want to authenticate against\\\\\\\\nthe default user. This provides backward compatibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore using ACLs, you may want to ask yourself what\\'s the goal you want to\\\\\\\\naccomplish by implementing this layer of protection. Normally there are\\\\\\\\ntwo main goals that are well served by ACLs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You want to improve security by restricting the access to commands and keys, so that untrusted clients have no access and trusted clients have just the minimum access level to the database in order to perform the work needed. For instance, certain clients may just be able to execute read only commands.\\\\\\\\n2. You want to improve operational safety, so that processes or humans accessing Redis are not allowed to damage the data or the configuration due to software errors or manual mistakes. For instance, there is no reason for a worker that fetches delayed jobs from Redis to be able to call the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother typical usage of ACLs is related to managed Redis instances. Redis is\\\\\\\\noften provided as a managed service both by internal company teams that handle\\\\\\\\nthe Redis infrastructure for the other internal customers they have, or is\\\\\\\\nprovided in a software-as-a-service setup by cloud providers. In both \\\\\\\\nsetups, we want to be sure that configuration commands are excluded for the\\\\\\\\ncustomers.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5007,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a0527f7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a0527f7-031\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisstack 7.2 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Stack 7.2.0-v1 (September 2023) > Details:\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This version contains security fixes for the Redis server for cases when users may access keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration using the [SORT_RO](https://redis.io/commands/sort_ro/) command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Security Fixes**\\\\\\\\n* **Redis**:\\\\\\\\n  * (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by SORT_RO and,\\\\\\\\nas a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not\\\\\\\\nexplicitly authorized by the ACL configuration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bug Fixes**\\\\\\\\n* **Redis**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#12538](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12538) Fix crashes when joining a node to an existing 7.0 Redis Cluster\\\\\\\\n  * [#12545](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12545), [#12530](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12530) Correct request_policy and response_policy command tips on for some admin /\\\\\\\\nconfiguration commands\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis version**\\\\\\\\n* __[Redis 7.2.1](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.2.1)__\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Module versions**\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n* __[RediSearch 2.8.4](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/releases/tag/v2.8.4)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisJSON 2.6.6](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/releases/tag/v2.6.6)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisTimeSeries 1.10.4](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/releases/tag/v1.10.4)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisBloom 2.6.3](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/releases/tag/v2.6.3)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisGears 2.0.11](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/releases/tag/v2.0.11-m12)__\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Recommended Client Libraries**\\\\\\\\n* Java\\\\\\\\n  * [Jedis 5.0.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/jedis/releases/tag/v5.0.0)\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-spring 0.8.7 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-spring/releases/tag/v0.8.7)\\\\\\\\n* Python\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-py 5.0.0 or greater ](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/releases/tag/v5.0.0)\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-python 0.2.1 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-python/releases/tag/v0.2.1)\\\\\\\\n* NodeJS\\\\\\\\n  * [node-redis 4.6.8 or greater](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/releases/tag/redis%404.6.8)\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-node 0.2.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-node/releases/tag/v0.2.0)\\\\\\\\n* .NET\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-dotnet 0.5.3 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-dotnet/releases/tag/v0.5.3)\\\\\\\\n  * [NRedisStack 0.9.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/NRedisStack/releases/tag/v0.9.0)\\\\\\\\n* Go\\\\\\\\n  * [go-redis 9.1.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/releases/tag/v9.1.0)\\\\\\\\n  * [rueidis 1.0.17 or greater](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/releases/tag/v1.0.17)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCompatible with [RedisInsight](https://redis.io/download).

You can do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Use [`ACL LOAD`](/commands/acl-load) if you modified the ACL file manually and you want Redis to reload the new configuration. Note that this command is able to load the file *only if all the users are correctly specified*. Otherwise, an error is reported to the user, and the old configuration will remain valid.\\\\\\\\n* Use [`ACL SAVE`](/commands/acl-save) to save the current ACL configuration to the ACL file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite) does not also trigger [`ACL SAVE`](/commands/acl-save). When you use\\\\\\\\nan ACL file, the configuration and the ACLs are handled separately.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn case you don\\'t want to provide Redis replicas and Redis Sentinel instances\\\\\\\\nfull access to your Redis instances, the following is the set of commands\\\\\\\\nthat must be allowed in order for everything to work correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinel, allow the user to access the following commands both in the master and replica instances:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AUTH, CLIENT, SUBSCRIBE, SCRIPT, PUBLISH, PING, INFO, MULTI, SLAVEOF, CONFIG, CLIENT, EXEC.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel does not need to access any key in the database but does use Pub/Sub, so the ACL rule would be the following (note: [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) is not needed since it is always allowed):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ACL SETUSER sentinel-user on >somepassword allchannels +multi +slaveof +ping +exec +subscribe +config|rewrite +role +publish +info +client|setname +client|kill +script|kill\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis replicas require the following commands to be allowed on the master instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PSYNC, REPLCONF, PING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNo keys need to be accessed, so this translates to the following rules:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ACL setuser replica-user on >somepassword +psync +replconf +ping\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that you don\\'t need to configure the replicas to allow the master to be able to execute any set of commands.

Each master also takes an offset that\\\\\\\\nincrements for every byte of replication stream that it is produced to be\\\\\\\\nsent to replicas, to update the state of the replicas with the new changes\\\\\\\\nmodifying the dataset. The replication offset is incremented even if no replica\\\\\\\\nis actually connected, so basically every given pair of:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Replication ID, offset\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdentifies an exact version of the dataset of a master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen replicas connect to masters, they use the [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) command to send\\\\\\\\ntheir old master replication ID and the offsets they processed so far. This way\\\\\\\\nthe master can send just the incremental part needed. However if there is not\\\\\\\\nenough *backlog* in the master buffers, or if the replica is referring to an\\\\\\\\nhistory (replication ID) which is no longer known, then a full resynchronization\\\\\\\\nhappens: in this case the replica will get a full copy of the dataset, from scratch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how a full synchronization works in more details:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe master starts a background saving process to produce an RDB file. At the same time it starts to buffer all new write commands received from the clients. When the background saving is complete, the master transfers the database file to the replica, which saves it on disk, and then loads it into memory. The master will then send all buffered commands to the replica. This is done as a stream of commands and is in the same format of the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can try it yourself via telnet. Connect to the Redis port while the\\\\\\\\nserver is doing some work and issue the [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) command. You\\'ll see a bulk\\\\\\\\ntransfer and then every command received by the master will be re-issued\\\\\\\\nin the telnet session. Actually [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) is an old protocol no longer used by\\\\\\\\nnewer Redis instances, but is still there for backward compatibility: it does\\\\\\\\nnot allow partial resynchronizations, so now [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) is used instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs already said, replicas are able to automatically reconnect when the master-replica link goes down for some reason. If the master receives multiple concurrent replica synchronization requests, it performs a single background save in to serve all of them.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.1312,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"At the base of Redis replication (excluding the high availability features provided as an additional layer by Redis Cluster or Redis Sentinel) there is a *leader follower* (master-replica) replication that is simple to use and configure. It allows replica Redis instances to be exact copies of master instances. The replica will automatically reconnect to the master every time the link breaks, and will attempt to be an exact copy of it *regardless* of what happens to the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis system works using three main mechanisms:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. When a master and a replica instance are well-connected, the master keeps the replica updated by sending a stream of commands to the replica to replicate the effects on the dataset happening on the master side due to: client writes, keys expired or evicted, any other action changing the master dataset.\\\\\\\\n2. When the link between the master and the replica breaks, for network issues or because a timeout is sensed in the master or the replica, the replica reconnects and attempts to proceed with a partial resynchronization: it means that it will try to just obtain the part of the stream of commands it missed during the disconnection.\\\\\\\\n3. When a partial resynchronization is not possible, the replica will ask for a full resynchronization. This will involve a more complex process in which the master needs to create a snapshot of all its data, send it to the replica, and then continue sending the stream of commands as the dataset changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses by default asynchronous replication, which being low latency and\\\\\\\\nhigh performance, is the natural replication mode for the vast majority of Redis\\\\\\\\nuse cases. However, Redis replicas asynchronously acknowledge the amount of data\\\\\\\\nthey receive periodically with the master. So the master does not wait every time\\\\\\\\nfor a command to be processed by the replicas, however it knows, if needed, what\\\\\\\\nreplica already processed what command. This allows having optional synchronous replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSynchronous replication of certain data can be requested by the clients using\\\\\\\\nthe [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) command. However [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) is only able to ensure there are the\\\\\\\\nspecified number of acknowledged copies in the other Redis instances, it does not\\\\\\\\nturn a set of Redis instances into a CP system with strong consistency: acknowledged\\\\\\\\nwrites can still be lost during a failover, depending on the exact configuration\\\\\\\\nof the Redis persistence. However, [WAIT]() dramatically reduces the probability of losing a write after a failure event to specific hard-to-trigger failure modes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can check the Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster documentation for more information\\\\\\\\nabout high availability and failover.

Aside from connecting a number of replicas to the same master, replicas can also be connected to other replicas in a cascading-like structure. Since Redis 4.0, all the sub-replicas will receive exactly the same replication stream from the master.\\\\\\\\n* Redis replication is non-blocking on the master side. This means that the master will continue to handle queries when one or more replicas perform the initial synchronization or a partial resynchronization.\\\\\\\\n* Replication is also largely non-blocking on the replica side. While the replica is performing the initial synchronization, it can handle queries using the old version of the dataset, assuming you configured Redis to do so in redis.conf.  Otherwise, you can configure Redis replicas to return an error to clients if the replication stream is down. However, after the initial sync, the old dataset must be deleted and the new one must be loaded. The replica will block incoming connections during this brief window (that can be as long as many seconds for very large datasets). Since Redis 4.0 you can configure Redis so that the deletion of the old data set happens in a different thread, however loading the new initial dataset will still happen in the main thread and block the replica.\\\\\\\\n* Replication can be used both for scalability, to have multiple replicas for read-only queries (for example, slow O(N) operations can be offloaded to replicas), or simply for improving data safety and high availability.\\\\\\\\n* You can use replication to avoid the cost of having the master writing the full dataset to disk: a typical technique involves configuring your master `redis.conf` to avoid persisting to disk at all, then connect a replica configured to save from time to time, or with AOF enabled.

Enable Latency Monitoring**\n```bash\nCONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\n```\nSet threshold in milliseconds based on your requirements. Use `LATENCY DOCTOR` for human-readable analysis.\n\n**2. Measure Baseline Latency**\n```bash\nredis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\n```\nRun this on the server (not client) to measure OS/hypervisor baseline latency.\n\n**3. Check for Slow Commands**\n```bash\nSLOWLOG GET 10\n```\nIdentifies blocking commands like `KEYS`, `SORT`, `SUNION` on large datasets.\n\n**4. Monitor Latency Events**\n- `LATENCY LATEST` - recent latency samples\n- `LATENCY HISTORY <event>` - time series for specific events\n- `LATENCY GRAPH <event>` - ASCII visualization\n\n## Common Causes & Fixes\n\n**Slow Commands**\n- ❌ Avoid `KEYS` in production (use `SCAN` instead)\n- ❌ Avoid O(N) commands on large datasets\n- Use replicas for expensive queries\n\n**Transparent Huge Pages**\n```bash\necho never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\n```\nThis is critical - THP causes massive latency spikes during fork operations.\n\n**Swapping**\nCheck if Redis memory is swapped:\n```bash\ncat /proc/$(pidof redis-server)/smaps | grep 'Swap:'\n```\nFix: Add more RAM or reduce memory pressure.\n\n**Fork Operations (BGSAVE/AOF rewrite)**\n- Use HVM-based EC2 instances (not Xen)\n- On VMs, expect 10-400ms fork time per GB\n- Disable AOF or use `appendfsync everysec`\n\n**AOF Persistence**\nDurability vs latency tradeoffs:\n1. `appendfsync always` - slowest, strongest durability\n2. `appendfsync everysec` - good compromise (recommended)\n3. `appendfsync no` - fastest, weakest durability\n4. Add `no-appendfsync-on-rewrite yes` to reduce disk pressure\n\n**Expiration Cycles**\nIf >25% of keys expire in the same second, Redis blocks to clean them up. Avoid using `EXPIREAT` with identical timestamps.\n\n**Network Latency**\n- Use Unix domain sockets if client is on same host\n- Use pipelining to reduce round trips\n- Keep connections long-lived\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency.md]\n[来源:

worst-case latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile Redis is an in-memory system, it deals with the operating system in\\\\\\\\ndifferent ways, for example, in the context of persisting to disk.\\\\\\\\nMoreover Redis implements a rich set of commands. Certain commands\\\\\\\\nare fast and run in constant or logarithmic time.

Latency monitoring is composed of the following conceptual\\\\\\\\nparts:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Latency hooks that sample different latency-sensitive code paths.\\\\\\\\n* Time series recording of latency spikes, split by different events.\\\\\\\\n* Reporting engine to fetch raw data from the time series.\\\\\\\\n* Analysis engine to provide human-readable reports and hints according to the measurements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe rest of this document covers the latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\ndetails.

Other events are less generic and monitor\\\\\\\\nspecific operations performed by Redis. For example, the `fork` event\\\\\\\\nonly monitors the time taken by Redis to execute the `fork(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA latency spike is an event that takes more time to run than the configured latency\\\\\\\\nthreshold. There is a separate time series associated with every monitored\\\\\\\\nevent. This is how the time series work:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time a latency spike happens, it is logged in the appropriate time series.\\\\\\\\n* Every time series is composed of 160 elements.\\\\\\\\n* Each element is a pair made of a Unix timestamp of the time the latency spike was measured and the number of milliseconds the event took to execute.\\\\\\\\n* Latency spikes for the same event that occur in the same second are merged by taking the maximum latency.

Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for. However\\\\\\\\nthere is not just a single swap field since the smaps file contains the\\\\\\\\ndifferent memory maps of our Redis process (The memory layout of a process\\\\\\\\nis more complex than a simple linear array of pages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince we are interested in all the memory swapped by our process the first thing\\\\\\\\nto do is to grep for the Swap field across all the file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | grep \\'Swap:\\'\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf everything is 0 kB, or if there are sporadic 4k entries, everything is\\\\\\\\nperfectly normal. Actually in our example instance (the one of a real web\\\\\\\\nsite running Redis and serving hundreds of users every second) there are a\\\\\\\\nfew entries that show more swapped pages.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server. The stack trace is different if the server blocks in a different context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you happen to collect multiple watchdog stack traces you are encouraged to send everything to the Redis Google Group: the more traces we obtain, the simpler it will be to understand what the problem with your instance is.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5054,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency-monitor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis latency monitoring\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Report information with the LATENCY command\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"What is high latency for one use case may not be considered high latency for another. Some applications may require that all queries be served in less than 1 millisecond. For other applications, it may be acceptable for a small amount of clients to experience a 2 second latency on occasion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step to enable the latency monitor is to set a **latency threshold** in milliseconds. Only events that take longer than the specified threshold will be logged as latency spikes. The user should set the threshold according to their needs. For example, if the application requires a maximum acceptable latency of 100 milliseconds, the threshold should be set to log all the events blocking the server for a time equal or greater to 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEnable the latency monitor at runtime in a production server\\\\\\\\nwith the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMonitoring is turned off by default (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero.

Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.6113,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search/query-performance-factor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Query Performance Factor\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Monitoring Redis Query Engine\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To monitor a database with a query performance factor configured:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.6765,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b1c1a56c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b1c1a56c-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisearch/redisearch-1.6-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisearch 1.6 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.6 GA (January 2020)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This is the General Availability Release of RediSearch 1.6 (v1.6.7).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHeadlines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Several performance improvements increasing full-text search queries up to 60% and aggregation queries up to 73%.\\\\\\\\n- Support for aliasing of indices.\\\\\\\\n- Low-level API in C (and [Rust bindings](https://github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-api-rs)) to make RediSearch embeddable in other Redis modules.

Configure maxmemory limits**\n- Always set `maxmemory` to prevent Redis from consuming all system memory\n- Calculate overhead: set to 80-90% of available memory (e.g., 8-9 GB for 10 GB free)\n- Set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` to return errors instead of crashing when limit is reached\n\n**2. Use special encoding for small data types**\nSmall hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets use up to **10x less memory** (5x average) when below configured thresholds. Configure in redis.conf:\n- `hash-max-zipmap-entries 256`\n- `hash-max-zipmap-value 1024`\n\n**3. Use hashes for key-value storage**\nInstead of many individual keys, use hashes with a sharding pattern:\n- Split keys like `object:1234` into hash key `object:12` with field `34`\n- Each hash contains ~100 fields for optimal CPU/memory balance\n- **Result: 1.7 MB vs 11 MB** for 100K objects (6.5x reduction)\n\n**4. Use bit/byte operations for boolean data**\n- Use bitmaps (`GETBIT`, `SETBIT`) for flags/subscriptions\n- 100 million users = only 12 MB with bitmaps\n- Use `GETRANGE`/`SETRANGE` to store one byte per user\n\n**5. Memory allocation considerations**\n- Provision for **peak memory usage**, not average\n- Redis doesn't always return freed memory to OS (allocator behavior)\n- Fragmentation ratio unreliable after large deletions\n- Write-heavy workloads can use up to 2x memory during RDB/AOF saves\n\n**6. Vector sets optimization** (if using vector search)\n- Use `Q8` quantization: 4x smaller, high recall (default)\n- Use `BIN` quantization: 32x smaller for coarse search\n- Lower `M` parameter to reduce HNSW graph memory\n- Use `REDUCE` option to project high-dimensional vectors (e.g., 300→100 dims)\n- Keep JSON attributes minimal and flat\n\n**7. System-level settings**\n- Set `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` in Linux\n- Disable Transparent Huge Pages: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled`\n- Enable swap equal to system memory size\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md]  \n[来源: redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md]  \n[来源: redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RDB", "AOF", "user", "memory", "optimization", "encoding", "OBJECT", "MEMORY", "script"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "4332034a-1f4a-4a76-9ded-b15c8f4dc885", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "439433c5-6d09-449b-8ba1-f65b72309580", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for Redis memory optimization best practices using multiple tools in parallel.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_QOgPWFGuwh5FCeVcPbjvAd', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'memory optimization|memory management|memory usage|maxmemory'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_tUcTWzOmYPo1493DvpW3AA', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis memory optimization best practices', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_QOgPWFGuwh5FCeVcPbjvAd', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_tUcTWzOmYPo1493DvpW3AA', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.4743,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"See also\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis vector sets are efficient, but vector similarity indexing and graph traversal require memory tradeoffs.

This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory error for write commands if and when it reaches the \\\\\\\\nlimit - which in turn may result in errors in the application but will not render the \\\\\\\\nwhole machine dead because of memory starvation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.0146,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Special encoding of small aggregate data types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Since Redis 2.2 many data types are optimized to use less space up to a certain size.\\\\\\\\nHashes, Lists, Sets composed of just integers, and Sorted Sets, when smaller than a given number of elements, and up to a maximum element size, are encoded in a very memory-efficient way that uses *up to 10 times less memory* (with 5 times less memory used being the average saving).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is completely transparent from the point of view of the user and API.\\\\\\\\nSince this is a CPU / memory tradeoff it is possible to tune the maximum \\\\\\\\nnumber of elements and maximum element size for special encoded types \\\\\\\\nusing the following redis.conf directives (defaults are shown):\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.9398,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Using hashes to abstract a very memory-efficient plain key-value store on top of Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"I understand the title of this section is a bit scary, but I\\'m going to explain in detail what this is about.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically it is possible to model a plain key-value store using Redis\\\\\\\\nwhere values can just be just strings, which is not just more memory efficient\\\\\\\\nthan Redis plain keys but also much more memory efficient than memcached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with some facts: a few keys use a lot more memory than a single key\\\\\\\\ncontaining a hash with a few fields. How is this possible? We use a trick.\\\\\\\\nIn theory to guarantee that we perform lookups in constant time\\\\\\\\n(also known as O(1) in big O notation) there is the need to use a data structure\\\\\\\\nwith a constant time complexity in the average case, like a hash table.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut many times hashes contain just a few fields. When hashes are small we can\\\\\\\\ninstead just encode them in an O(N) data structure, like a linear\\\\\\\\narray with length-prefixed key-value pairs. Since we do this only when N\\\\\\\\nis small, the amortized time for [`HGET`](/commands/hget) and [`HSET`](/commands/hset) commands is still O(1): the\\\\\\\\nhash will be converted into a real hash table as soon as the number of elements\\\\\\\\nit contains grows too large (you can configure the limit in redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis does not only work well from the point of view of time complexity, but\\\\\\\\nalso from the point of view of constant times since a linear array of key-value pairs happens to play very well with the CPU cache (it has a better\\\\\\\\ncache locality than a hash table).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since hash fields and values are not (always) represented as full-featured Redis objects, hash fields can\\'t have an associated time to live\\\\\\\\n(expire) like a real key, and can only contain a string. But we are okay with\\\\\\\\nthis, this was the intention anyway when the hash data type API was\\\\\\\\ndesigned (we trust simplicity more than features, so nested data structures\\\\\\\\nare not allowed, as expires of single fields are not allowed).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo hashes are memory efficient. This is useful when using hashes\\\\\\\\nto represent objects or to model other problems when there are group of\\\\\\\\nrelated fields. But what about if we have a plain key value business?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImagine we want to use Redis as a cache for many small objects, which can be JSON encoded objects, small HTML fragments, simple key -> boolean values\\\\\\\\nand so forth. Basically, anything is a string -> string map with small keys\\\\\\\\nand values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow let\\'s assume the objects we want to cache are numbered, like:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * object:102393\\\\\\\\n * object:1234\\\\\\\\n * object:5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what we can do. Every time we perform a\\\\\\\\nSET operation to set a new value, we actually split the key into two parts,\\\\\\\\none part used as a key, and the other part used as the field name for the hash. For instance, the\\\\\\\\nobject named \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:1234\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is actually split into:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* a Key named object:12\\\\\\\\n* a Field named 34\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo we use all the characters but the last two for the key, and the final\\\\\\\\ntwo characters for the hash field name. To set our key we use the following\\\\\\\\ncommand:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nHSET object:12 34 somevalue\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see every hash will end up containing 100 fields, which is an optimal compromise between CPU and memory saved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is another important thing to note, with this schema\\\\\\\\nevery hash will have more or\\\\\\\\nless 100 fields regardless of the number of objects we cached. This is because our objects will always end with a number and not a random string. In some way, the final number can be considered as a form of implicit pre-sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat about small numbers? Like object:2? We handle this case using just\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as a key name, and the whole number as the hash field name.\\\\\\\\nSo object:2 and object:10 will both end inside the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but one\\\\\\\\nas field name \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and one as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow much memory do we save this way?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI used the following Ruby program to test how this works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```ruby\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'rubygems\\'\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'redis\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUSE_OPTIMIZATION = true\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef hash_get_key_field(key)\\\\\\\\n  s = key.split(\\':\\')\\\\\\\\n  if s[1].length > 2\\\\\\\\n    { key: s[0] + \\':\\' + s[1][0..-3], field: s[1][-2..-1] }\\\\\\\\n  else\\\\\\\\n    { key: s[0] + \\':\\', field: s[1] }\\\\\\\\n  end\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef hash_set(r, key, value)\\\\\\\\n  kf = hash_get_key_field(key)\\\\\\\\n  r.hset(kf[:key], kf[:field], value)\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef hash_get(r, key, value)\\\\\\\\n  kf = hash_get_key_field(key)\\\\\\\\n  r.hget(kf[:key], kf[:field], value)\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nr = Redis.new\\\\\\\\n(0..100_000).each do |id|\\\\\\\\n  key = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:#{id}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n  if USE_OPTIMIZATION\\\\\\\\n    hash_set(r, key, \\'val\\')\\\\\\\\n  else\\\\\\\\n    r.set(key, \\'val\\')\\\\\\\\n  end\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the result against a 64 bit instance of Redis 2.2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * USE_OPTIMIZATION set to true: 1.7 MB of used memory\\\\\\\\n * USE_OPTIMIZATION set to false; 11 MB of used memory\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an order of magnitude, I think this makes Redis more or less the most\\\\\\\\nmemory efficient plain key value store out there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*WARNING*: for this to work, make sure that in your redis.conf you have\\\\\\\\nsomething like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nhash-max-zipmap-entries 256\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso remember to set the following field accordingly to the maximum size\\\\\\\\nof your keys and values:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nhash-max-zipmap-value 1024\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery time a hash exceeds the number of elements or element size specified\\\\\\\\nit will be converted into a real hash table, and the memory saving will be lost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may ask, why don\\'t you do this implicitly in the normal key space so that\\\\\\\\nI don\\'t have to care? There are two reasons: one is that we tend to make\\\\\\\\ntradeoffs explicit, and this is a clear tradeoff between many things: CPU,\\\\\\\\nmemory, and max element size. The second is that the top-level key space must\\\\\\\\nsupport a lot of interesting things like expires, LRU data, and so\\\\\\\\nforth so it is not practical to do this in a general way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut the Redis Way is that the user must understand how things work so that he can pick the best compromise and to understand how the system will\\\\\\\\nbehave exactly.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6567,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis FAQ\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Are Redis on-disk snapshots atomic?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Yes, a common design pattern involves taking very write-heavy small data\\\\\\\\nin Redis (and data you need the Redis data structures to model your problem\\\\\\\\nin an efficient way), and big *blobs* of data into an SQL or eventually\\\\\\\\nconsistent on-disk database. Similarly sometimes Redis is used in order to\\\\\\\\ntake in memory another copy of a subset of the same data stored in the on-disk\\\\\\\\ndatabase. This may look similar to caching, but actually is a more advanced model\\\\\\\\nsince normally the Redis dataset is updated together with the on-disk DB dataset,\\\\\\\\nand not refreshed on cache misses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA good practice is to consider memory consumption when mapping your logical data model to the physical data model within Redis. These considerations include using specific data types, key patterns, and normalization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeyond data modeling, there is more info in the [Memory Optimization page]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has built-in protections allowing the users to set a max limit on memory\\\\\\\\nusage, using the `maxmemory` option in the configuration file to put a limit\\\\\\\\nto the memory Redis can use. If this limit is reached, Redis will start to reply\\\\\\\\nwith an error to write commands (but will continue to accept read-only\\\\\\\\ncommands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also configure Redis to evict keys when the max memory limit\\\\\\\\nis reached. See the [eviction policy docs]() for more information on this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShort answer: `echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` :)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now the long one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis background saving schema relies on the copy-on-write semantic of the `fork` system call in\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems: Redis forks (creates a child process) that is an\\\\\\\\nexact copy of the parent. The child process dumps the DB on disk and finally\\\\\\\\nexits. In theory the child should use as much memory as the parent being a\\\\\\\\ncopy, but actually thanks to the copy-on-write semantic implemented by most\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems the parent and child process will _share_ the common\\\\\\\\nmemory pages. A page will be duplicated only when it changes in the child or in\\\\\\\\nthe parent. Since in theory all the pages may change while the child process is\\\\\\\\nsaving, Linux can\\'t tell in advance how much memory the child will take, so if\\\\\\\\nthe `overcommit_memory` setting is set to zero the fork will fail unless there is\\\\\\\\nas much free RAM as required to really duplicate all the parent memory pages.\\\\\\\\nIf you have a Redis dataset of 3 GB and just 2 GB of free\\\\\\\\nmemory it will fail.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSetting `overcommit_memory` to 1 tells Linux to relax and perform the fork in a\\\\\\\\nmore optimistic allocation fashion, and this is indeed what you want for Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can refer to the [proc(5)][proc5] man page for explanations of the\\\\\\\\navailable values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[proc5]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, the Redis background saving process is always forked when the server is\\\\\\\\noutside of the execution of a command, so every command reported to be atomic\\\\\\\\nin RAM is also atomic from the point of view of the disk snapshot.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6135,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack.

Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4785,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"String objects APIs > `RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation`\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"void RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation(RedisModuleString *str);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 7.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTrim possible excess memory allocated for a `RedisModuleString`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes a `RedisModuleString` may have more memory allocated for\\\\\\\\nit than required, typically for argv arguments that were constructed\\\\\\\\nfrom network buffers.

Setting `port 0` disables the non-TLS port entirely.\n\n## Starting the Server\n\n```bash\n./src/redis-server --tls-port 6379 --port 0 \\\n    --tls-cert-file ./tests/tls/redis.crt \\\n    --tls-key-file ./tests/tls/redis.key \\\n    --tls-ca-cert-file ./tests/tls/ca.crt\n```\n\n## Connecting with redis-cli\n\n```bash\n./src/redis-cli --tls \\\n    --cert ./tests/tls/redis.crt \\\n    --key ./tests/tls/redis.key \\\n    --cacert ./tests/tls/ca.crt\n```\n\n## Additional Options\n\n- **Client Authentication**: By default, Redis uses mutual TLS. To disable client certificate authentication: `tls-auth-clients no`\n- **Replication**: For replica servers, use `tls-replication yes` to enable TLS for connections to the master\n- **Cluster**: Use `tls-cluster yes` to enable TLS for cluster bus communications\n- **Sentinel**: Inherits TLS settings; uses `tls-replication` to determine TLS usage\n\n**Note**: TLS is available starting with Redis 6 and adds overhead that reduces throughput. Redis 8.0+ supports I/O threading with TLS for better performance.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md > TLS]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/install-redis-from-source.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/build-stack/almalinux-rocky-8.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "master", "cluster", "replication", "replica", "TLS", "SSL", "encrypt"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/install-redis-from-source.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/build-stack/almalinux-rocky-8.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "328bba5f-5067-4ec3-b967-2a29b67b284f", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "43009ca8-48d9-42db-a443-468f26ebf47e", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about enabling TLS encryption for Redis connections.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_8kTPmbkBrFqTScA5tK5BdL', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis TLS encryption enable connections SSL', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_JcyXdhO4lIUBTQKlwybpGG', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'TLS|SSL|encryption|tls-port|tls-cert'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_8kTPmbkBrFqTScA5tK5BdL', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.7283,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TLS\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"SSL/TLS is supported by Redis starting with version 6 as an optional feature\\\\\\\\nthat needs to be enabled at compile time.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7696,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TLS\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Getting Started > Limitations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Additional TLS configuration is available to control the choice of TLS protocol\\\\\\\\nversions, ciphers and cipher suites, etc. Please consult the self documented\\\\\\\\n`redis.conf` for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTLS adds a layer to the communication stack with overheads due to writing/reading to/from an SSL connection, encryption/decryption and integrity checks.

Let\\'s look at what some of the data returned represents:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **addr**: The client address, that is, the client IP and the remote port number it used to connect with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n* **fd**: The client socket file descriptor number.\\\\\\\\n* **name**: The client name as set by [`CLIENT SETNAME`]().\\\\\\\\n* **age**: The number of seconds the connection existed for.\\\\\\\\n* **idle**: The number of seconds the connection is idle.\\\\\\\\n* **flags**: The kind of client (N means normal client, check the [full list of flags]()).\\\\\\\\n* **omem**: The amount of memory used by the client for the output buffer.\\\\\\\\n* **cmd**: The last executed command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [[`CLIENT LIST`]()](/commands/client-list) documentation for the full listing of fields and their purpose.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you have the list of clients, you can close a client\\'s connection using the [`CLIENT KILL`]() command, specifying the client address as its argument.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe commands [`CLIENT SETNAME`]() and [`CLIENT GETNAME`]() can be used to set and get the connection name. Starting with Redis 4.0, the client name is shown in the\\\\\\\\n[`SLOWLOG`]() output, to help identify clients that create latency issues.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom version 3.2 onwards, Redis has TCP keepalive (`SO_KEEPALIVE` socket option) enabled by default and set to about 300 seconds. This option is useful in order to detect dead peers (clients that cannot be reached even if they look connected). Moreover, if there is network equipment between clients and servers that need to see some traffic in order to take the connection open, the option will prevent unexpected connection closed events.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.0794,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"81091cbf\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"81091cbf-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Debugging Lua scripts in Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Synchronous mode\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When the scripts terminates naturally, the debugging session ends and\\\\\\\\n`redis-cli` returns in its normal non-debugging mode. You can restart the\\\\\\\\nsession using the `restart` command as usual.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother way to stop a debugging session is just interrupting `redis-cli`\\\\\\\\nmanually by pressing `Ctrl+C`. Note that also any event breaking the\\\\\\\\nconnection between `redis-cli` and the `redis-server` will interrupt the\\\\\\\\ndebugging session.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll the forked debugging sessions are terminated when the server is shut\\\\\\\\ndown.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDebugging can be a very repetitive task. For this reason every Redis\\\\\\\\ndebugger command starts with a different character, and you can use the single\\\\\\\\ninitial character in order to refer to the command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example instead of typing `step` you can just type `s`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding and removing breakpoints is trivial as described in the online help.\\\\\\\\nJust use `b 1 2 3 4` to add a breakpoint in line 1, 2, 3, 4.\\\\\\\\nThe command `b 0` removes all the breakpoints. Selected breakpoints can be\\\\\\\\nremoved using as argument the line where the breakpoint we want to remove is, but prefixed by a minus sign. \\\\\\\\nSo for example `b -3` removes the breakpoint from line 3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that adding breakpoints to lines that Lua never executes, like declaration of local variables or comments, will not work.\\\\\\\\nThe breakpoint will be added but since this part of the script will never be executed, the program will never stop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the `breakpoint` command it is possible to add breakpoints into specific\\\\\\\\nlines. However sometimes we want to stop the execution of the program only\\\\\\\\nwhen something special happens. In order to do so, you can use the\\\\\\\\n`redis.breakpoint()` function inside your Lua script. When called it simulates\\\\\\\\na breakpoint in the next line that will be executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nif counter > 10 then redis.breakpoint() end\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThis feature is extremely useful when debugging, so that we can avoid\\\\\\\\ncontinuing the script execution manually multiple times until a given condition\\\\\\\\nis encountered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs explained previously, but default LDB uses forked sessions with rollback\\\\\\\\nof all the data changes operated by the script while it has being debugged.\\\\\\\\nDeterminism is usually a good thing to have during debugging, so that successive\\\\\\\\ndebugging sessions can be started without having to reset the database content\\\\\\\\nto its original state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever for tracking certain bugs, you may want to retain the changes performed\\\\\\\\nto the key space by each debugging session. When this is a good idea you\\\\\\\\nshould start the debugger using a special option, `ldb-sync-mode`, in `redis-cli`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n./redis-cli --ldb-sync-mode --eval /tmp/script.lua\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> Note: Redis server will be unreachable during the debugging session in this mode, so use with care.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this special mode, the `abort` command can stop the script half-way taking the changes operated to the dataset.\\\\\\\\nNote that this is different compared to ending the debugging session normally. \\\\\\\\nIf you just interrupt `redis-cli` the script will be fully executed and then the session terminated.\\\\\\\\nInstead with `abort` you can interrupt the script execution in the middle and start a new debugging session if needed.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.6378,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f4edca5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f4edca5-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search/commands.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Commands\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The following table lists search and query commands.

While `redis-cli` is the default debug client, any client can be used for debugging as long as it meets one of the following conditions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The client provides a native interface for setting the debug mode and controlling the debug session.\\\\\\\\n2. The client provides an interface for sending arbitrary commands over RESP.\\\\\\\\n3. The client allows sending raw messages to the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, the [Redis plugin](https://redis.com/blog/zerobrane-studio-plugin-for-redis-lua-scripts) for [ZeroBrane Studio](http://studio.zerobrane.com/) integrates with LDB using [redis-lua](https://github.com/nrk/redis-lua).

We do our best with\\\\\\\\nevery release to make sure you\\'ll experience a stable product with no\\\\\\\\ncrashes. However, if you ever need to debug the Redis process itself, read on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis crashes, it produces a detailed report of what happened. However,\\\\\\\\nsometimes looking at the crash report is not enough, nor is it possible for\\\\\\\\nthe Redis core team to reproduce the issue independently. In this scenario, we\\\\\\\\nneed help from the user who can reproduce the issue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis guide shows how to use GDB to provide the information the\\\\\\\\nRedis developers will need to track the bug more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGDB is the Gnu Debugger: a program that is able to inspect the internal state\\\\\\\\nof another program. Usually tracking and fixing a bug is an exercise in\\\\\\\\ngathering more information about the state of the program at the moment the\\\\\\\\nbug happens, so GDB is an extremely useful tool.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGDB can be used in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It can attach to a running program and inspect the state of it at runtime.\\\\\\\\n* It can inspect the state of a program that already terminated using what is called a *core file*, that is, the image of the memory at the time the program was running.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of investigating Redis bugs we need to use both of these\\\\\\\\nGDB modes. The user able to reproduce the bug attaches GDB to their running Redis\\\\\\\\ninstance, and when the crash happens, they create the `core` file that in turn\\\\\\\\nthe developer will use to inspect the Redis internals at the time of the crash.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis way the developer can perform all the inspections in his or her computer\\\\\\\\nwithout the help of the user, and the user is free to restart Redis in their\\\\\\\\nproduction environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default Redis is compiled with the `-O2` switch, this means that compiler\\\\\\\\noptimizations are enabled. This makes the Redis executable faster, but at the\\\\\\\\nsame time it makes Redis (like any other program) harder to inspect using GDB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is better to attach GDB to Redis compiled without optimizations using the\\\\\\\\n`make noopt` command (instead of just using the plain `make` command). However,\\\\\\\\nif you have an already running Redis in production there is no need to recompile\\\\\\\\nand restart it if this is going to create problems on your side. GDB still works\\\\\\\\nagainst executables compiled with optimizations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not be overly concerned at the loss of performance from compiling Redis\\\\\\\\nwithout optimizations. It is unlikely that this will cause problems in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment as Redis is not very CPU-bound.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.2289,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1d4c65d2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1d4c65d2-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/troubleshooting.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Troubleshooting Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"List of known Linux related bugs affecting Redis.\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This page tries to help you with what to do if you have issues with Redis.

Create your script in some file with your preferred editor. Let\\'s assume you are editing your Redis Lua script located at `/tmp/script.lua`.\\\\\\\\n2. Start a debugging session with:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-cli --ldb --eval /tmp/script.lua\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that with the `--eval` option of `redis-cli` you can pass key names and arguments to the script, separated by a comma, like in the following example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n./redis-cli --ldb --eval /tmp/script.lua mykey somekey , arg1 arg2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll enter a special mode where `redis-cli` no longer accepts its normal\\\\\\\\ncommands, but instead prints a help screen and passes the unmodified debugging\\\\\\\\ncommands directly to Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe only commands which are not passed to the Redis debugger are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `quit` -- this will terminate the debugging session.\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s like removing all the breakpoints and using the `continue` debugging command.\\\\\\\\nMoreover the command will exit from `redis-cli`.\\\\\\\\n* `restart` -- the debugging session will restart from scratch, **reloading the new version of the script from the file**.\\\\\\\\nSo a normal debugging cycle involves modifying the script after some debugging, and calling `restart` in order to start debugging again with the new script changes.\\\\\\\\n* `help` -- this command is passed to the Redis Lua debugger, that will print a list of commands like the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nlua debugger> help\\\\\\\\nRedis Lua debugger help:\\\\\\\\n[h]elp               Show this help.\\\\\\\\n[s]tep               Run current line and stop again.\\\\\\\\n[n]ext               Alias for step.\\\\\\\\n[c]ontinue           Run till next breakpoint.\\\\\\\\n[l]ist               List source code around current line.\\\\\\\\n[l]ist [line]        List source code around [line].\\\\\\\\n                     line = 0 means: current position.\\\\\\\\n[l]ist [line] [ctx]  In this form [ctx] specifies how many lines\\\\\\\\n                     to show before/after [line].\\\\\\\\n[w]hole              List all source code.

Backup your data first**\n\nBefore upgrading, create snapshots on each node:\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p <port> SAVE\n```\n\nRepeat for every node (both masters and replicas). This creates RDB files in the data directory. Identify the data directory location with:\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p <port> CONFIG GET dir\n```\n\n**2. Upgrade replicas first**\n\nUpgrading replica nodes is straightforward:\n- Stop the replica node\n- Install the updated Redis version\n- Restart with the new version\n\nClients using replicas for read scaling will automatically reconnect to other available replicas during the upgrade.\n\n**3. Upgrade masters (zero-downtime approach)**\n\nFor master nodes, use manual failover to avoid downtime:\n\n1. **Trigger a manual failover** to promote a replica to master:\n   ```bash\n   CLUSTER FAILOVER\n   ```\n   Execute this command on one of the master's replicas.\n\n2. **Wait for role switch** - The original master becomes a replica\n\n3. **Upgrade the node** - Now that it's a replica, upgrade it safely\n\n4. **Failover back (optional)** - If you want the upgraded node to be master again, trigger another manual failover\n\n### Why Manual Failover is Safe\n\nManual failovers are safer than automatic failovers because they:\n- Avoid data loss by ensuring the new master has processed all replication stream from the old master\n- Only switch clients when the system confirms synchronization is complete\n- Block clients temporarily on the old master, then redirect them to the new master\n\n### Important Notes\n\n⚠️ **Practice first**: Test the upgrade procedure in a controlled environment (Docker is recommended) before upgrading production.\n\n⚠️ **Redis Query Engine**: If using Redis Query Engine, it won't be fully operational until all master shards complete their upgrades. Queries during upgrade may return errors or \"Waiting for all nodes to connect\" messages.\n\n### Verification\n\nAfter upgrading each node, verify:\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p <port> INFO server | grep redis_version\nredis-cli -p <port> cluster info\nredis-cli --cluster check <IP address>:<port>\n```\n\nAlso verify data accessibility and client connectivity.\n\n[来源:

practice upgrading Redis in a controlled environment before upgrading it in a production environment.\\\\\\\\nDocker is an excellent tool to use for this purpose.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow these instructions to upgrade a Redis cluster. This guide assumes you have installed Redis using one of the supported methods listed [here]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore upgrading, create a snapshot of your current dataset on each node (identified by its port) using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> SAVE\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRepeat for every node in your cluster, both masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis creates or updates an `RDB` file, for example `dump.rdb`, in the node\\'s Redis data directory. If you use AOF persistence, the files will be named `appendonly.aof.*` and they will be written in the `appendonlydir` directory inside the data directory. The AOF-related directory and file names are the defaults. Use the names defined in your `redis.conf` file if different from the defaults.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the following command on each node to identify where your data directories are located:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> CONFIG GET dir\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake a copy of the files contained in each of those directories before proceeding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpgrade each node one at a time, starting with the replicas, using these steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Stop the current version of Redis Open Source or Redis Stack server.\\\\\\\\n1. Follow the installation steps that correspond to your [Redis distribution]() to install Redis 8.\\\\\\\\n1. Start Redis 8 if it didn\\'t start automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf necessary, restore the saved files to their original locations on each node. Then restart Redis on each node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Query Engine won\\'t be fully operational until all master shards have completed their upgrades.\\\\\\\\nAny queries sent during the upgrade process will either return errors or a message such as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Waiting for all nodes to connect\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> INFO server | grep redis_version\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> cluster info\\\\\\\\nredis-cli --cluster check <IP address>:<port>\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should also verify that your data is accessible and that your clients can connect successfully.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3752,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a21b6283\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a21b6283-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/install/upgrade-module.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Upgrade Module\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Upgrade a module for a database\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Upgrade a module in Redis Software to get the latest features and fixes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- If you upgrade a single-node cluster, it does not load the new modules that are bundled with the new cluster version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Before you upgrade a database with the RediSearch module enabled to Redis 5.0, you must upgrade the RediSearch module to version 1.4.2 or later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore you upgrade a module enabled in a database, [install the new version of the module on the cluster]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter you install an updated module on the cluster, you can upgrade databases to use the new module version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter you upgrade the module for a database, the database shards restart. This causes a short interruption in the availability of this database across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo upgrade a module enabled for a database:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Connect to the terminal of a node in the cluster.\\\\\\\\n1. Run `rladmin status` to list the databases on the node.\\\\\\\\n1. Copy the name of the database that uses the module that you want to upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Find the exact module name and version:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    1.

Find the module name and version number in the file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Here\\'s an example of the JSON file for the RediSearch module:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. To see the versions of the modules on the cluster, run either:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - `rladmin status modules` - Shows the latest modules available on the cluster and the modules used by databases.\\\\\\\\n    - `rladmin status modules all` - Shows all of the modules available on the cluster and the modules used by databases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. To upgrade a database to the latest version of Redis and its modules to the latest version without changing the module arguments:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - For clusters with Redis Software versions 7.8.2 or later, run:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        ```sh\\\\\\\\n        rladmin upgrade db < database-name | database-ID >\\\\\\\\n        ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - For clusters with versions earlier than 7.8.2, include the `latest_with_modules` option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        ```sh\\\\\\\\n        rladmin upgrade db < database-name | database-ID > latest_with_modules\\\\\\\\n        ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\nThe upgrade process does not validate the module upgrade arguments, and incorrect arguments can cause unexpected downtime. Test module upgrade commands in a test environment before you upgrade modules in production. \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - Use `keep_redis_version` to upgrade the modules without upgrading the database to the latest Redis version.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        `keep_redis_version` is deprecated as of Redis Software version 7.8.2. To upgrade modules without upgrading the Redis database version, set `redis_version` to the current Redis database version instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - To specify the modules to upgrade, add the following for each module:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        ```sh\\\\\\\\n        and module module_name <module_name> version <new_module_version_number> module_args \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<module arguments>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n        ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        For the module arguments, use one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        - `module_args \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<module_arguments>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` to replace the existing module arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        - `module_args \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` without arguments to remove the existing module arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        - `module_args keep_args` to use the existing module arguments.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.0041,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-017\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Replica migration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In Redis Cluster, you can reconfigure a replica to replicate with a\\\\\\\\ndifferent master at any time just using this command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CLUSTER REPLICATE <master-node-id>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever there is a special scenario where you want replicas to move from one\\\\\\\\nmaster to another one automatically, without the help of the system administrator.\\\\\\\\nThe automatic reconfiguration of replicas is called *replicas migration* and is\\\\\\\\nable to improve the reliability of a Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nYou can read the details of replicas migration in the [Redis Cluster Specification](), here we\\'ll only provide some information about the\\\\\\\\ngeneral idea and what you should do in order to benefit from it.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why you may want to let your cluster replicas to move from one master\\\\\\\\nto another under certain condition, is that usually the Redis Cluster is as\\\\\\\\nresistant to failures as the number of replicas attached to a given master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example a cluster where every master has a single replica can\\'t continue\\\\\\\\noperations if the master and its replica fail at the same time, simply because\\\\\\\\nthere is no other instance to have a copy of the hash slots the master was\\\\\\\\nserving. However while net-splits are likely to isolate a number of nodes\\\\\\\\nat the same time, many other kind of failures, like hardware or software failures\\\\\\\\nlocal to a single node, are a very notable class of failures that are unlikely\\\\\\\\nto happen at the same time, so it is possible that in your cluster where\\\\\\\\nevery master has a replica, the replica is killed at 4am, and the master is killed\\\\\\\\nat 6am. This still will result in a cluster that can no longer operate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo improve reliability of the system we have the option to add additional\\\\\\\\nreplicas to every master, but this is expensive. Replica migration allows to\\\\\\\\nadd more replicas to just a few masters. So you have 10 masters with 1 replica\\\\\\\\neach, for a total of 20 instances. However you add, for example, 3 instances\\\\\\\\nmore as replicas of some of your masters, so certain masters will have more\\\\\\\\nthan a single replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith replicas migration what happens is that if a master is left without\\\\\\\\nreplicas, a replica from a master that has multiple replicas will migrate to\\\\\\\\nthe *orphaned* master. So after your replica goes down at 4am as in the example\\\\\\\\nwe made above, another replica will take its place, and when the master\\\\\\\\nwill fail as well at 5am, there is still a replica that can be elected so that\\\\\\\\nthe cluster can continue to operate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo what you should know about replicas migration in short?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The cluster will try to migrate a replica from the master that has the greatest number of replicas in a given moment.\\\\\\\\n* To benefit from replica migration you have just to add a few more replicas to a single master in your cluster, it does not matter what master.\\\\\\\\n* There is a configuration parameter that controls the replica migration feature that is called `cluster-migration-barrier`: you can read more about it in the example `redis.conf` file provided with Redis Cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.1472,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9c3be0f9\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9c3be0f9-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/gears-v1/installing-redisgears.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Installing Redisgears\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Uninstall RedisGears\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To upgrade RedisGears for an existing database after installing a new version, use [`rladmin upgrade db`]():\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nrladmin upgrade db <database-name-or-ID> and module module_name rg version <new_version_integer> module_args \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<module arguments>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following example shows how to upgrade a database named `shopping-cart` to RedisGears version 1.2.9 without changing its configuration:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nrladmin upgrade db shopping-cart and module module_name rg version 10209 module_args keep_args\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese command examples also upgrade the database to the latest Redis version on the cluster.

This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_edcBn3AWK5kby4NN28zjHY', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Based on the search results, here\\'s how to upgrade a Redis cluster without downtime:\\n\\n## Upgrade Process (Rolling Upgrade)\\n\\nThe recommended approach is to perform a **rolling upgrade** by upgrading nodes one at a time, starting with replicas:\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\\n\\n**1.

When Redis receives these signals, it schedules a shutdown (similar to the `SHUTDOWN` command) that starts as soon as the current command completes, with a possible delay of 0.1 seconds or less.\n\n### Shutdown Process\n\n1. **Replica synchronization** (Redis 7.0+):\n   - Pauses write clients using `CLIENT PAUSE` with WRITE option\n   - Waits up to `shutdown-timeout` (default 10 seconds) for replicas to catch up with replication offset\n\n2. **Background processes**:\n   - Kills any background child saving RDB or performing AOF rewrite\n\n3. **Data persistence**:\n   - If AOF is active: calls `fsync` to flush buffers to disk\n   - If RDB persistence is configured: performs synchronous (blocking) save\n   - **Important**: If RDB/AOF save fails, shutdown is aborted to prevent data loss\n\n4. **Cleanup**:\n   - Removes PID file (if daemonized)\n   - Removes Unix domain socket (if enabled)\n   - Exits with code 0\n\n### Special Cases\n\n- **Long-running Lua scripts**: Use `SCRIPT KILL` to terminate the script before shutdown proceeds\n- **No save points + AOF disabled**: The replica wait timeout (7.0+) minimizes data loss risk\n- **Manual failover recommended**: For heavily loaded masters in diskless setups, trigger `FAILOVER` or `CLUSTER FAILOVER` before shutdown to demote the master first\n\n## Crash Signals\n\n**SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGFPE,

such as `SIGTERM` and `SIGSEGV`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe information in this document **only applies to Redis version 2.6 or greater**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals tell Redis to shut down gracefully. When the server receives this signal,\\\\\\\\nit does not immediately exit. Instead, it schedules\\\\\\\\na shutdown similar to the one performed by the [`SHUTDOWN`](/commands/shutdown) command. The scheduled shutdown starts as soon as possible, specifically as long as the\\\\\\\\ncurrent command in execution terminates (if any), with a possible additional\\\\\\\\ndelay of 0.1 seconds or less.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the server is blocked by a long-running Lua script,\\\\\\\\nkill the script with [`SCRIPT KILL`](/commands/script-kill) if possible. The scheduled shutdown will\\\\\\\\nrun just after the script is killed or terminates spontaneously.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis shutdown process includes the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If there are any replicas lagging behind in replication:\\\\\\\\n  * Pause clients attempting to write with [`CLIENT PAUSE`](/commands/client-pause) and the `WRITE` option.\\\\\\\\n  * Wait up to the configured `shutdown-timeout` (default 10 seconds) for replicas to catch up with the master\\'s replication offset.\\\\\\\\n* If a background child is saving the RDB file or performing an AOF rewrite, the child process is killed.\\\\\\\\n* If the AOF is active, Redis calls the `fsync` system call on the AOF file descriptor to flush the buffers on disk.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis is configured to persist on disk using RDB files, a synchronous (blocking) save is performed. Since the save is synchronous, it doesn\\'t use any additional memory.\\\\\\\\n* If the server is daemonized, the PID file is removed.\\\\\\\\n* If the Unix domain socket is enabled, it gets removed.\\\\\\\\n* The server exits with an exit code of zero.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIF the RDB file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails, and the server continues to run in order to ensure no data loss.\\\\\\\\nLikewise, if the user just turned on AOF, and the server triggered the first AOF rewrite in order to create the initial AOF file but this file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails and the server continues to run.\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.6.11, no further attempt to shut down will be made unless a new `SIGTERM` is received or the [`SHUTDOWN`](/commands/shutdown) command is issued.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 7.0, the server waits for lagging replicas up to a configurable `shutdown-timeout`, 10 seconds by default, before shutting down.\\\\\\\\nThis provides a best effort to minimize the risk of data loss in a situation where no save points are configured and AOF is deactivated.\\\\\\\\nBefore version 7.0, shutting down a heavily loaded master node in a diskless setup was more likely to result in data loss.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risk of data loss in such setups, trigger a manual [`FAILOVER`](/commands/failover) (or [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)) to demote the master to a replica and promote one of the replicas to a new master before shutting down a master node.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.7774,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis signal handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Kill the RDB file without errors\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The following signals are handled as a Redis crash:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* SIGSEGV\\\\\\\\n* SIGBUS\\\\\\\\n* SIGFPE\\\\\\\\n* SIGILL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce one of these signals is trapped, Redis stops any current operation and performs the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Adds a bug report to the log file. This includes a stack trace, dump of registers, and information about the state of clients.\\\\\\\\n* Since Redis 2.8, a fast memory test is performed as a first check of the reliability of the crashing system.\\\\\\\\n* If the server was daemonized, the PID file is removed.\\\\\\\\n* Finally the server unregisters its own signal handler for the received signal and resends the same signal to itself to make sure that the default action is performed, such as dumping the core on the file system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the child performing the Append Only File rewrite gets killed by a signal,\\\\\\\\nRedis handles this as an error and discards the (probably partial or corrupted)\\\\\\\\nAOF file. It will attempt the rewrite again later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the child performing an RDB save is killed, Redis handles the\\\\\\\\ncondition as a more severe error. While the failure of an\\\\\\\\nAOF file rewrite can cause AOF file enlargement, failed RDB file\\\\\\\\ncreation reduces durability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result of the child producing the RDB file being killed by a signal,\\\\\\\\nor when the child exits with an error (non zero exit code), Redis enters\\\\\\\\na special error condition where no further write command is accepted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis will continue to reply to read commands.\\\\\\\\n* Redis will reply to all write commands with a `MISCONFIG` error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis error condition will persist until it becomes possible to create an RDB file successfully.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes the user may want to kill the RDB-saving child process without\\\\\\\\ngenerating an error. Since Redis version 2.6.10, this can be done using the signal `SIGUSR1`. This signal is handled in a special way:\\\\\\\\nit kills the child process like any other signal, but the parent process will\\\\\\\\nnot detect this as a critical error and will continue to serve write\\\\\\\\nrequests.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.9219,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-022\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > SDOWN and ODOWN failure state\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel has two different concepts of *being down*, one is called\\\\\\\\na *Subjectively Down* condition (SDOWN) and is a down condition that is\\\\\\\\nlocal to a given Sentinel instance. Another is called *Objectively Down*\\\\\\\\ncondition (ODOWN) and is reached when enough Sentinels (at least the\\\\\\\\nnumber configured as the `quorum` parameter of the monitored master) have\\\\\\\\nan SDOWN condition, and get feedback from other Sentinels using\\\\\\\\nthe `SENTINEL is-master-down-by-addr` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of a Sentinel an SDOWN condition is reached when it\\\\\\\\ndoes not receive a valid reply to PING requests for the number of seconds\\\\\\\\nspecified in the configuration as `is-master-down-after-milliseconds`\\\\\\\\nparameter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn acceptable reply to PING is one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with +PONG.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -LOADING error.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -MASTERDOWN error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAny other reply (or no reply at all) is considered non valid.\\\\\\\\nHowever note that **a logical master that advertises itself as a replica in\\\\\\\\nthe INFO output is considered to be down**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that SDOWN requires that no acceptable reply is received for the whole\\\\\\\\ninterval configured, so for instance if the interval is 30000 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n(30 seconds) and we receive an acceptable ping reply every 29 seconds, the\\\\\\\\ninstance is considered to be working.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSDOWN is not enough to trigger a failover: it only means a single Sentinel\\\\\\\\nbelieves a Redis instance is not available. To trigger a failover, the\\\\\\\\nODOWN state must be reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo switch from SDOWN to ODOWN no strong consensus algorithm is used, but\\\\\\\\njust a form of gossip: if a given Sentinel gets reports that a master\\\\\\\\nis not working from enough Sentinels **in a given time range**, the SDOWN is\\\\\\\\npromoted to ODOWN. If this acknowledge is later missing, the flag is cleared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA more strict authorization that uses an actual majority is required in\\\\\\\\norder to really start the failover, but no failover can be triggered without\\\\\\\\nreaching the ODOWN state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ODOWN condition **only applies to masters**. For other kind of instances\\\\\\\\nSentinel doesn\\'t require to act, so the ODOWN state is never reached for replicas\\\\\\\\nand other sentinels, but only SDOWN is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever SDOWN has also semantic implications. For example a replica in SDOWN\\\\\\\\nstate is not selected to be promoted by a Sentinel performing a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels and replicas auto discovery\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels stay connected with other Sentinels in order to reciprocally\\\\\\\\ncheck the availability of each other, and to exchange messages. However you\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t need to configure a list of other Sentinel addresses in every Sentinel\\\\\\\\ninstance you run, as Sentinel uses the Redis instances Pub/Sub capabilities\\\\\\\\nin order to discover the other Sentinels that are monitoring the same masters\\\\\\\\nand replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is implemented by sending *hello messages* into the channel named\\\\\\\\n`__sentinel__:hello`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly you don\\'t need to configure what is the list of the replicas attached\\\\\\\\nto a master, as Sentinel will auto discover this list querying Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel publishes a message to every monitored master and replica Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello`, every two seconds, announcing its presence with ip, port, runid.\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel is subscribed to the Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello` of every master and replica, looking for unknown sentinels. When new sentinels are detected, they are added as sentinels of this master.\\\\\\\\n* Hello messages also include the full current configuration of the master. If the receiving Sentinel has a configuration for a given master which is older than the one received, it updates to the new configuration immediately.\\\\\\\\n* Before adding a new sentinel to a master a Sentinel always checks if there is already a sentinel with the same runid or the same address (ip and port pair). In that case all the matching sentinels are removed, and the new added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel reconfiguration of instances outside the failover procedure\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven when no failover is in progress, Sentinels will always try to set the\\\\\\\\ncurrent configuration on monitored instances. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Replicas (according to the current configuration) that claim to be masters, will be configured as replicas to replicate with the current master.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas connected to a wrong master, will be reconfigured to replicate with the right master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinels to reconfigure replicas, the wrong configuration must be observed for some time, that is greater than the period used to broadcast new configurations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis prevents Sentinels with a stale configuration (for example because they just rejoined from a partition) will try to change the replicas configuration before receiving an update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note how the semantics of always trying to impose the current configuration makes the failover more resistant to partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Masters failed over are reconfigured as replicas when they return available.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas partitioned away during a partition are reconfigured once reachable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe important lesson to remember about this section is: **Sentinel is a system where each process will always try to impose the last logical configuration to the set of monitored instances**.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.1677,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis client handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"What Order are Client Requests Served In?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This document provides information about how Redis handles clients at the network layer level: connections, timeouts, buffers, and other similar topics are covered here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe information contained in this document is **only applicable to Redis version 2.6 or greater**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis accepts clients connections on the configured TCP port and on the Unix socket if enabled. When a new client connection is accepted the following operations are performed:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client socket is put in the non-blocking state since Redis uses multiplexing and non-blocking I/O.\\\\\\\\n* The `TCP_NODELAY` option is set in order to ensure that there are no delays to the connection.\\\\\\\\n* A *readable* file event is created so that Redis is able to collect the client queries as soon as new data is available to read on the socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the client is initialized, Redis checks if it is already at the limit\\\\\\\\nconfigured for the number of simultaneous clients (configured using the `maxclients` configuration directive, see the next section of this document for further information).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis can\\'t accept a new client connection because the maximum number of clients\\\\\\\\nhas been reached, it tries to send an error to the client in order to\\\\\\\\nmake it aware of this condition, closing the connection immediately.\\\\\\\\nThe error message will reach the client even if the connection is\\\\\\\\nclosed immediately by Redis because the new socket output buffer is usually\\\\\\\\nbig enough to contain the error, so the kernel will handle transmission\\\\\\\\nof the error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe order is determined by a combination of the client socket file descriptor\\\\\\\\nnumber and order in which the kernel reports events, so the order should be \\\\\\\\nconsidered as unspecified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, Redis does the following two things when serving clients:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It only performs a single `read()` system call every time there is something new to read from the client socket. This ensures that if we have multiple clients connected, and a few send queries at a high rate, other clients are not penalized and will not experience latency issues.\\\\\\\\n* However once new data is read from a client, all the queries contained in the current buffers are processed sequentially. This improves locality and does not need iterating a second time to see if there are clients that need some processing time.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.2477,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis client handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Client Timeouts\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"By default recent versions of Redis don\\'t close the connection with the client\\\\\\\\nif the client is idle for many seconds: the connection will remain open forever.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever if you don\\'t like this behavior, you can configure a timeout, so that\\\\\\\\nif the client is idle for more than the specified number of seconds, the client connection will be closed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can configure this limit via `redis.conf` or simply using `CONFIG SET timeout <value>`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the timeout only applies to normal clients and it **does not apply to Pub/Sub clients**, since a Pub/Sub connection is a *push style* connection so a client that is idle is the norm.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if by default connections are not subject to timeout, there are two conditions when it makes sense to set a timeout:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Mission critical applications where a bug in the client software may saturate the Redis server with idle connections, causing service disruption.\\\\\\\\n* As a debugging mechanism in order to be able to connect with the server if a bug in the client software saturates the server with idle connections, making it impossible to interact with the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTimeouts are not to be considered very precise: Redis avoids setting timer events or running O(N) algorithms in order to check idle clients, so the check is performed incrementally from time to time.

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.6657,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Appendix: Why are busy loops slow even on the loopback interface?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In the following benchmark we\\'ll use the Redis Ruby client, supporting pipelining, to test the speed improvement due to pipelining:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```ruby\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'rubygems\\'\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'redis\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef bench(descr)\\\\\\\\n  start = Time.now\\\\\\\\n  yield\\\\\\\\n  puts \\\\\\\\\\\\\"#{descr} #{Time.now -

So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall.

No other client's request can interrupt the transaction execution.\n\n**All-or-nothing on connection loss**: If the client loses connection before calling `EXEC`, none of the operations are performed. If `EXEC` is called, all operations are performed.\n\n## Error handling\n\n- **Syntax errors** (before EXEC): Detected during command queuing. Redis refuses to execute the transaction and returns an error during `EXEC`.\n- **Runtime errors** (after EXEC): Redis does NOT stop processing. Even if one command fails, all other commands in the queue are still executed. **No rollback support**.\n\n## Aborting transactions\n\nUse `DISCARD` to abort a transaction and flush the command queue:\n\n```redis\n> MULTI\nOK\n> INCR foo\nQUEUED\n> DISCARD\nOK\n```\n\n## Optimistic locking with WATCH\n\n`WATCH` provides check-and-set (CAS) behavior. If a watched key is modified before `EXEC`, the entire transaction aborts:\n\n```redis\nWATCH mykey\nval = GET mykey\nval = val + 1\nMULTI\nSET mykey $val\nEXEC\n```\n\nIf another client modifies `mykey` between `WATCH` and `EXEC`, the transaction fails and returns a Null reply.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md > Usage, Discarding the command queue, Optimistic locking using check-and-set]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/multi-key-operations.md", "docs/dual-repo-architecture.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md", "docs/design.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["MULTI", "EXEC", "transaction"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/multi-key-operations.md", "docs/dual-repo-architecture.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md", "docs/design.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "8a877551-6ca4-4afb-8913-d2c13a56e972", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "709ca862-48d1-46d1-b582-bfce46d253ad", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis transactions and MULTI/EXEC commands.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_FXdchMCzx3PoXWtwljWGzM', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis transactions MULTI EXEC', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_fesuP5nr3uUExBnRYTVzFa', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'MULTI|EXEC'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_FXdchMCzx3PoXWtwljWGzM', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.4467,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Transactions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Usage\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Transactions allow the execution of a group of commands\\\\\\\\nin a single step, they are centered around the commands \\\\\\\\n[`MULTI`](), [`EXEC`](), [`DISCARD`]() and [`WATCH`]().\\\\\\\\nRedis Transactions make two important guarantees:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* All the commands in a transaction are serialized and executed\\\\\\\\nsequentially.

Otherwise, if the client elected to proceed with the transaction\\\\\\\\nthe [`EXEC`]() command would execute all commands queued successfully regardless of previous errors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nErrors happening *after* [`EXEC`]() instead are not handled in a special way:\\\\\\\\nall the other commands will be executed even if some command fails during the transaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is more clear on the protocol level.

This costs memory in the server side, but sends invalidation messages only for the set of keys that the client might have in memory.\\\\\\\\n* In the _broadcasting_ mode, the server does not attempt to remember what keys a given client accessed, so this mode costs no memory at all in the server side. Instead clients subscribe to key prefixes such as `object:` or `user:`, and receive a notification message every time a key matching a subscribed prefix is touched.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo recap, for now let\\'s forget for a moment about the broadcasting mode, to\\\\\\\\nfocus on the first mode. We\\'ll describe broadcasting in more detail later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Clients can enable tracking if they want. Connections start without tracking enabled.\\\\\\\\n2. When tracking is enabled, the server remembers what keys each client requested during the connection lifetime (by sending read commands about such keys).\\\\\\\\n3. When a key is modified by some client, or is evicted because it has an associated expire time, or evicted because of a _maxmemory_ policy, all the clients with tracking enabled that may have the key cached, are notified with an _invalidation message_.\\\\\\\\n4. When clients receive invalidation messages, they are required to remove the corresponding keys, in order to avoid serving stale data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of the protocol:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: CLIENT TRACKING ON\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: GET foo\\\\\\\\n* (The server remembers that Client 1 may have the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" cached)\\\\\\\\n* (Client 1 may remember the value of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" inside its local memory)\\\\\\\\n* Client 2 `->` Server: SET foo SomeOtherValue\\\\\\\\n* Server `->` Client 1: INVALIDATE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis looks great superficially, but if you imagine 10k connected clients all\\\\\\\\nasking for millions of keys over long living connection, the server ends up\\\\\\\\nstoring too much information. For this reason Redis uses two key ideas in\\\\\\\\norder to limit the amount of memory used server-side and the CPU cost of\\\\\\\\nhandling the data structures implementing the feature:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The server remembers the list of clients that may have cached a given key in a single global table. This table is called the **Invalidation Table**. The invalidation table can contain a maximum number of entries. If a new key is inserted, the server may evict an older entry by pretending that such key was modified (even if it was not), and sending an invalidation message to the clients. Doing so, it can reclaim the memory used for this key, even if this will force the clients having a local copy of the key to evict it.\\\\\\\\n* Inside the invalidation table we don\\'t really need to store pointers to clients\\' structures, that would force a garbage collection procedure when the client disconnects: instead what we do is just store client IDs (each Redis client has a unique numerical ID). If a client disconnects, the information will be incrementally garbage collected as caching slots are invalidated.\\\\\\\\n* There is a single keys namespace, not divided by database numbers. So if a client is caching the key `foo` in database 2, and some other client changes the value of the key `foo` in database 3, an invalidation message will still be sent. This way we can ignore database numbers reducing both the memory usage and the implementation complexity.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.1171,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"The NOLOOP option\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"So far we described the first client-side caching model that Redis implements.\\\\\\\\nThere is another one, called broadcasting, that sees the problem from the\\\\\\\\npoint of view of a different tradeoff, does not consume any memory on the\\\\\\\\nserver side, but instead sends more invalidation messages to clients.\\\\\\\\nIn this mode we have the following main behaviors:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients enable client-side caching using the `BCAST` option, specifying one or more prefixes using the `PREFIX` option. For instance: `CLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 10 BCAST PREFIX object: PREFIX user:`. If no prefix is specified at all, the prefix is assumed to be the empty string, so the client will receive invalidation messages for every key that gets modified. Instead if one or more prefixes are used, only keys matching one of the specified prefixes will be sent in the invalidation messages.\\\\\\\\n* The server does not store anything in the invalidation table. Instead it uses a different **Prefixes Table**, where each prefix is associated to a list of clients.\\\\\\\\n* No two prefixes can track overlapping parts of the keyspace. For instance, having the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foob\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would not be allowed, since they would both trigger an invalidation for the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foobar\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, just using the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is sufficient.\\\\\\\\n* Every time a key matching any of the prefixes is modified, all the clients subscribed to that prefix, will receive the invalidation message.\\\\\\\\n* The server will consume CPU proportional to the number of registered prefixes. If you have just a few, it is hard to see any difference. With a big number of prefixes the CPU cost can become quite large.\\\\\\\\n* In this mode the server can perform the optimization of creating a single reply for all the clients subscribed to a given prefix, and send the same reply to all. This helps to lower the CPU usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default client-side tracking will send invalidation messages to the\\\\\\\\nclient that modified the key. Sometimes clients want this, since they\\\\\\\\nimplement very basic logic that does not involve automatically caching\\\\\\\\nwrites locally. However, more advanced clients may want to cache even the\\\\\\\\nwrites they are doing in the local in-memory table. In such case receiving\\\\\\\\nan invalidation message immediately after the write is a problem, since it\\\\\\\\nwill force the client to evict the value it just cached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this case it is possible to use the `NOLOOP` option: it works both\\\\\\\\nin normal and broadcasting mode. Using this option, clients are able to\\\\\\\\ntell the server they don\\'t want to receive invalidation messages for keys\\\\\\\\nthat they modified.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7535,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Two connections mode\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Using the new version of the Redis protocol, RESP3, supported by Redis 6, it is possible to run the data queries and receive the invalidation messages in the same connection. However many client implementations may prefer to implement client-side caching using two separated connections: one for data, and one for invalidation messages. For this reason when a client enables tracking, it can specify to redirect the invalidation messages to another connection by specifying the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"client ID\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of a different connection. Many data connections can redirect invalidation messages to the same connection, this is useful for clients implementing connection pooling. The two connections model is the only one that is also supported for RESP2 (which lacks the ability to multiplex different kind of information in the same connection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of a complete session using the Redis protocol in the old RESP2 mode involving the following steps: enabling tracking redirecting to another connection, asking for a key, and getting an invalidation message once the key gets modified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo start, the client opens a first connection that will be used for invalidations, requests the connection ID, and subscribes via Pub/Sub to the special channel that is used to get invalidation messages when in RESP2 modes (remember that RESP2 is the usual Redis protocol, and not the more advanced protocol that you can use, optionally, with Redis 6 using the [`HELLO`]() command):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT ID\\\\\\\\n:4\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE __redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$9\\\\\\\\nsubscribe\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow we can enable tracking from the data connection:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 2 -- data connection)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 4\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGET foo\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nbar\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client may decide to cache `\\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" => \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` in the local memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA different client will now modify the value of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" key:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Some other unrelated connection)\\\\\\\\nSET foo bar\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result, the invalidations connection will receive a message that invalidates the specified key.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$7\\\\\\\\nmessage\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*1\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nfoo\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe client will check if there are cached keys in this caching slot, and will evict the information that is no longer valid.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the third element of the Pub/Sub message is not a single key but\\\\\\\\nis a Redis array with just a single element. Since we send an array, if there\\\\\\\\nare groups of keys to invalidate, we can do that in a single message.\\\\\\\\nIn case of a flush ([`FLUSHALL`]() or [`FLUSHDB`]()), a `null` message will be sent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA very important thing to understand about client-side caching used with\\\\\\\\nRESP2 and a Pub/Sub connection in order to read the invalidation messages,\\\\\\\\nis that using Pub/Sub is entirely a trick **in order to reuse old client\\\\\\\\nimplementations**, but actually the message is not really sent to a channel\\\\\\\\nand received by all the clients subscribed to it.

Yet the application\\\\\\\\nmay continue to serve the old username for user:1234.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes, depending on the exact application we are modeling, this isn\\'t a\\\\\\\\nbig deal, so the client will just use a fixed maximum \\\\\\\\\\\\\"time to live\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for the\\\\\\\\ncached information.

To avoid this problem, it is a good idea to populate the cache\\\\\\\\nwhen we send the command with a placeholder:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: set the local copy of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"caching-in-progress\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    [D] client-> server: GET foo.\\\\\\\\n    [I] server -> client: Invalidate foo (somebody else touched it)\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: delete \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the local cache.\\\\\\\\n    [D] server -> client: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the reply of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GET foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: don\\'t set \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\" since the entry for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is missing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSuch a race condition is not possible when using a single connection for both\\\\\\\\ndata and invalidation messages, since the order of the messages is always known\\\\\\\\nin that case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, if we lost the connection with the socket we use in order to\\\\\\\\nget the invalidation messages, we may end with stale data. In order to avoid\\\\\\\\nthis problem, we need to do the following things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure that if the connection is lost, the local cache is flushed.\\\\\\\\n2. Both when using RESP2 with Pub/Sub, or RESP3, ping the invalidation channel periodically (you can send PING commands even when the connection is in Pub/Sub mode!). If the connection looks broken and we are not able to receive ping backs, after a maximum amount of time, close the connection and flush the cache.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients may want to run internal statistics about the number of times\\\\\\\\na given cached key was actually served in a request, to understand in the\\\\\\\\nfuture what is good to cache. In general:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that change continuously.\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that are requested very rarely.\\\\\\\\n* We want to cache keys that are requested often and change at a reasonable rate. For an example of key not changing at a reasonable rate, think of a global counter that is continuously [`INCR`]()emented.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever simpler clients may just evict data using some random sampling just\\\\\\\\nremembering the last time a given cached value was served, trying to evict\\\\\\\\nkeys that were not served recently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Handling TTLs: make sure you also request the key TTL and set the TTL in the local cache if you want to support caching keys with a TTL.\\\\\\\\n* Putting a max TTL on every key is a good idea, even if it has no TTL. This protects against bugs or connection issues that would make the client have old data in the local copy.\\\\\\\\n* Limiting the amount of memory used by clients is absolutely needed. There must be a way to evict old keys when new ones are added.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Redis implements client-side caching through a feature called **Tracking**, which supports two modes for cache invalidation:\\n\\n## 1.

For better performance:\n\n1. Load the script once:\n```\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \"return 'Immabe a cached script'\"\n\"c664a3bf70bd1d45c4284ffebb65a6f2299bfc9f\"\n```\n\n2. Execute using the SHA1 digest with `EVALSHA`:\n```\nredis> EVALSHA c664a3bf70bd1d45c4284ffebb65a6f2299bfc9f 0\n\"Immabe a cached script\"\n```\n\n## Important Properties\n\n- **Atomic execution**: All server activities are blocked during script execution\n- **Data locality**: Logic executes where data lives, reducing latency\n- **Conditional updates**: Can perform complex operations across multiple keys and data types\n\n## Script Flags (Redis 7.0+)\n\nYou can declare flags using a shebang statement:\n\n```\n#!lua flags=no-writes,allow-stale\nlocal x = redis.call('get','x')\nreturn x\n```\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/eval-intro.md > Getting started, Script cache, Eval flags]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search",

upload and execute Lua scripts on the server.\\\\\\\\nScripts can employ programmatic control structures and use most of the [commands]() while executing to access the database.\\\\\\\\nBecause scripts execute in the server, reading and writing data from scripts is very efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis guarantees the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\nWhile executing the script, all server activities are blocked during its entire runtime.\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripting offers several properties that can be valuable in many cases.\\\\\\\\nThese include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Providing locality by executing logic where data lives. Data locality reduces overall latency and saves networking resources.\\\\\\\\n* Blocking semantics that ensure the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\n* Enabling the composition of simple capabilities that are either missing from Redis or are too niche to be a part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLua lets you run part of your application logic inside Redis.\\\\\\\\nSuch scripts can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine.\\\\\\\\nPresently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference]() page for complete documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough the server executes them, Eval scripts are regarded as a part of the client-side application, which is why they\\'re not named, versioned, or persisted.\\\\\\\\nSo all scripts may need to be reloaded by the application at any time if missing (after a server restart, fail-over to a replica, etc.).\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, [Redis Functions]() offer an alternative approach to programmability which allow the server itself to be extended with additional programmed logic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll start scripting with Redis by using the [`EVAL`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s our first example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello, scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, [`EVAL`]() takes two arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe first argument is a string that consists of the script\\'s Lua source code.\\\\\\\\nThe script doesn\\'t need to include any definitions of Lua function.\\\\\\\\nIt is just a Lua program that will run in the Redis engine\\'s context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second argument is the number of arguments that follow the script\\'s body, starting from the third argument, representing Redis key names.\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we used the value _0_ because we didn\\'t provide the script with any arguments, whether the names of keys or not.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.9816,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n

Redis commands from a Lua script either via [`redis.call()`]() or [`redis.pcall()`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two are nearly identical.\\\\\\\\nBoth execute a Redis command along with its provided arguments, if these represent a well-formed command.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as generic as possible and provide customized execution via their arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA script is loaded to the server\\'s cache by calling the [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() command and providing its source code.\\\\\\\\nThe server doesn\\'t execute the script, but instead just compiles and loads it to the server\\'s cache.\\\\\\\\nOnce loaded, you can execute the cached script with the SHA1 digest returned from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of loading and then executing a cached script:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Immabe a cached

Eval scripts are different than the default for functions that are mentioned below, see [Eval Flags]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you register a function or load an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nThis results in the following behavior:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. They can read and write data.\\\\\\\\n1. They can run in cluster mode, and are not able to run commands accessing keys of different hash slots.\\\\\\\\n1. Execution against a stale replica is denied to avoid inconsistent reads.\\\\\\\\n1. Execution under low memory is denied to avoid exceeding the configured threshold.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can use the following flags and instruct the server to treat the scripts\\' execution differently:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `no-writes`: this flag indicates that the script only reads data but never writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    By default, Redis will deny the execution of flagged scripts (Functions and Eval scripts with [shebang]()) against read-only replicas, as they may attempt to perform writes.\\\\\\\\n    Similarly, the server will not allow calling scripts with [`FCALL_RO`]() / [`EVAL_RO`]().\\\\\\\\n    Lastly, when data persistence is at risk due to a disk error, execution is blocked as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Using this flag allows executing the script:\\\\\\\\n    1.

This feature, which became available in Redis 7, supersedes the use of [EVAL]() in prior versions of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior versions of Redis made scripting available only via the [`EVAL`]() command, which allows a Lua script to be sent for execution by the server.\\\\\\\\nThe core use cases for [Eval Scripts]() is executing part of your application logic inside Redis, efficiently and atomically.\\\\\\\\nSuch script can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing [`EVAL`]() requires that the application sends the entire script for execution every time.\\\\\\\\nBecause this results in network and script compilation overheads, Redis provides an optimization in the form of the [`EVALSHA`]() command. By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes to already-established and well-liked ephemeral scripts, Redis v7.0 introduces Redis Functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.6902,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

a remote debugger consisting of a server, which is Redis itself, and a client, which is by default [`redis-cli`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Lua debugger is described in the [Lua scripts debugging]() section of the Redis documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen memory usage in Redis exceeds the `maxmemory` limit, the first write command encountered in the script that uses additional memory will cause the script to abort (unless [`redis.pcall`]() was used).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, an exception to the above is when the script\\'s first write command does not use additional memory, as is the case with  (for example, [`DEL`]() and [`LREM`]()).\\\\\\\\nIn this case, Redis will allow all commands in the script to run to ensure atomicity.\\\\\\\\nIf subsequent writes in the script consume additional memory, Redis\\' memory usage can exceed the threshold set by the `maxmemory` configuration directive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother scenario in which a script can cause memory usage to cross the `maxmemory` threshold is when the execution begins when Redis is slightly below `maxmemory`, so the script\\'s first write command is allowed.\\\\\\\\nAs the script executes, subsequent write commands consume more memory leading to the server using more RAM than the configured `maxmemory` directive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn those scenarios, you should consider setting the `maxmemory-policy` configuration directive to any values other than `noeviction`.\\\\\\\\nIn addition, Lua scripts should be as fast as possible so that eviction can kick in between executions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that you can change this behaviour by using [flags](#eval-flags)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally, when you run an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nHowever, starting with Redis 7.0, there\\'s a way to declare flags when creating a script in order to tell Redis how it should behave.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe way to do that is by using a Shebang statement on the first line of the script like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n#!lua flags=no-writes,allow-stale\\\\\\\\nlocal x = redis.call(\\'get\\',\\'x\\')\\\\\\\\nreturn x\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that as soon as Redis sees the `#!` comment, it\\'ll treat the script as if it declares flags, even if no flags are defined,\\\\\\\\nit still has a different set of defaults compared to a script without a `#!` line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother difference is that scripts without `#!` can run commands that access keys belonging to different cluster hash slots, but ones with `#!` inherit the default flags, so they cannot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to [Script flags]() to learn about the various scripts and the defaults.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_q6aok7T22CZDtKnSWYQXhD', content='Found 9

If memory exceeds the limit, Redis automatically evicts keys according to your configured eviction policy until memory drops back below the threshold.\n\n**Important**: Setting `maxmemory` alone doesn't stop keys from growing - you must also configure an eviction policy using `maxmemory-policy`.\n\n## Eviction Policies\n\nConfigure with `maxmemory-policy` in redis.conf or via `CONFIG SET`:\n\n**Most Common (recommended default)**:\n- `allkeys-lru` - Evicts least recently used keys from all keys. Best for typical cache workloads following the Pareto principle.\n\n**Other policies**:\n- `allkeys-lfu` - Evicts least frequently used keys\n- `allkeys-lrm` - Evicts least recently modified keys (good for read-heavy workloads)\n- `allkeys-random` - Random eviction\n- `volatile-lru/lfu/lrm/ttl/random` - Only evicts keys with TTL set\n- `noeviction` - Returns errors on writes when limit reached (default, but likely not what you want)\n\n**Key insight**: If you're using `volatile-*` policies but your keys don't have TTL set, Redis behaves like `noeviction` - it won't evict anything and keys keep growing.\n\n## Configuration Example\n\n```bash\n# In redis.conf\nmaxmemory 100mb\nmaxmemory-policy allkeys-lru\n\n# Or at runtime\nCONFIG SET maxmemory 100mb\nCONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru\n```\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n1. **Replication/Persistence buffers**: If using replication or AOF, set `maxmemory` slightly lower than actual RAM to leave room for write buffers (check `INFO memory` for `mem_not_counted_for_evict`)\n\n2. **Check current policy**: Run `CONFIG GET maxmemory-policy` - if it's `noeviction`, that's why keys aren't being evicted\n\n3. **Memory spikes**: Large operations (like big set intersections) can temporarily exceed the limit\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md > Key eviction]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["eviction", "maxmemory", "policy", "replica", "AOF", "KEYS", "memory", "monitor"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "f60bbff6-cda4-4594-8eab-d722dd04913c", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "a817ec51-d2dd-4111-ad7b-92be12aa2aec", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis memory eviction mechanisms.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_AIT2HPBBWN2bmgxIjkXRx8', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis maxmemory eviction policy keys growing memory limit', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_RUtT5xVxybKalqc5nE581S', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'glob': '*.md', 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'maxmemory|eviction'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_AIT2HPBBWN2bmgxIjkXRx8', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.3963,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Using the `maxmemory` configuration directive {#maxmem}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis is commonly used as a cache to speed up read accesses to a slower server\\\\\\\\nor database.

Therefore, such connections are never evicted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`maxmemory-clients` can be set permanently in the configuration file (`redis.conf`) or via the [`CONFIG SET`]() command.\\\\\\\\nThis setting can either be 0 (meaning no limit), a size in bytes (possibly with `mb`/`gb` suffix),\\\\\\\\nor a percentage of `maxmemory` by using the `%` suffix (e.g. setting it to `10%` would mean 10% of the `maxmemory` configuration).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe default setting is 0, meaning client eviction is turned off by default.\\\\\\\\nHowever, for any large production deployment, it is highly recommended to configure some non-zero `maxmemory-clients` value.\\\\\\\\nA value `5%`, for example, can be a good place to start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to flag a specific client connection to be excluded from the client eviction mechanism.\\\\\\\\nThis is useful for control path connections.\\\\\\\\nIf, for example, you have an application that monitors the server via the [`INFO`]() command and alerts you in case of a problem, you might want to make sure this connection isn\\'t evicted.\\\\\\\\nYou can do so using the following command (from the relevant client\\'s connection):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`CLIENT NO-EVICT`]() `on`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd you can revert that with:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`CLIENT NO-EVICT`]() `off`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more information and an example refer to the `maxmemory-clients` section in the default `redis.conf` file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClient eviction is available from Redis 7.0.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7829,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Eviction policies\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Use the `maxmemory-policy` configuration directive to select the eviction\\\\\\\\npolicy you want to use when the limit set by `maxmemory` is reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following policies are available:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-   `noeviction`: Keys are not evicted but the server will return an error\\\\\\\\n    when you try to execute commands that cache new data. If your database uses replication\\\\\\\\n    then this condition only applies to the primary database. Note that commands that only\\\\\\\\n    read existing data still work as normal.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-lru`: Evict the [least recently used](#apx-lru) (LRU) keys.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-lrm`: Evict the [least recently modified](#lrm-eviction) (LRM) keys.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-lfu`: Evict the [least frequently used](#lfu-eviction) (LFU) keys.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-random`: Evict keys at random.\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-lru`: Evict the least recently used keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-lrm`: Evict the least recently modified keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-lfu`: Evict the least frequently used keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-random`: Evicts random keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-ttl`: Evict keys with an associated expiration (TTL) that have the shortest remaining TTL value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `volatile-xxx` policies behave like `noeviction` if no keys have an associated expiration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should choose an eviction policy that fits the way your app\\\\\\\\naccesses keys. You may be able to predict the access pattern in advance\\\\\\\\nbut you can also use information from the `INFO` command at runtime to\\\\\\\\ncheck or improve your choice of policy (see\\\\\\\\n[Using the `INFO` command](#using-the-info-command) below for more information).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a rule of thumb:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-lru` when you expect that a subset of elements will be accessed far\\\\\\\\n    more often than the rest. This is a very common case according to the\\\\\\\\n    [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), so\\\\\\\\n    `allkeys-lru` is a good default option if you have no reason to prefer any others.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-lrm` when you want to preserve frequently read data but evict data\\\\\\\\n    that hasn\\'t been modified recently. This is useful for read-heavy workloads where\\\\\\\\n    you want to distinguish between data that\\'s actively being updated versus data\\\\\\\\n    that\\'s only being read.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-random` when you expect all keys to be accessed with roughly equal\\\\\\\\n    frequency. An example of this is when your app reads data items in a repeating cycle.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `volatile-ttl` if your code can estimate which keys are good candidates for eviction\\\\\\\\n    and assign short TTLs to them. Note also that if you make good use of\\\\\\\\n    key expiration, then you are less likely to run into the cache memory limit because keys\\\\\\\\n    will often expire before they need to be evicted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `volatile-lru`, `volatile-lrm`, and `volatile-random` policies are mainly useful when you want to use\\\\\\\\na single Redis instance for both caching and for a set of persistent keys. However,\\\\\\\\nyou should consider running two separate Redis instances in a case like this, if possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that setting an `expire` value for a key costs memory, so a\\\\\\\\npolicy like `allkeys-lru` is more memory efficient since it doesn\\'t need an\\\\\\\\n`expire` value to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.405,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis FAQ\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Are Redis on-disk snapshots atomic?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Yes, a common design pattern involves taking very write-heavy small data\\\\\\\\nin Redis (and data you need the Redis data structures to model your problem\\\\\\\\nin an efficient way), and big *blobs* of data into an SQL or eventually\\\\\\\\nconsistent on-disk database. Similarly sometimes Redis is used in order to\\\\\\\\ntake in memory another copy of a subset of the same data stored in the on-disk\\\\\\\\ndatabase. This may look similar to caching, but actually is a more advanced model\\\\\\\\nsince normally the Redis dataset is updated together with the on-disk DB dataset,\\\\\\\\nand not refreshed on cache misses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA good practice is to consider memory consumption when mapping your logical data model to the physical data model within Redis. These considerations include using specific data types, key patterns, and normalization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeyond data modeling, there is more info in the [Memory Optimization page]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has built-in protections allowing the users to set a max limit on memory\\\\\\\\nusage, using the `maxmemory` option in the configuration file to put a limit\\\\\\\\nto the memory Redis can use. If this limit is reached, Redis will start to reply\\\\\\\\nwith an error to write commands (but will continue to accept read-only\\\\\\\\ncommands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also configure Redis to evict keys when the max memory limit\\\\\\\\nis reached.

The child process dumps the DB on disk and finally\\\\\\\\nexits. In theory the child should use as much memory as the parent being a\\\\\\\\ncopy, but actually thanks to the copy-on-write semantic implemented by most\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems the parent and child process will _share_ the common\\\\\\\\nmemory pages. A page will be duplicated only when it changes in the child or in\\\\\\\\nthe parent. Since in theory all the pages may change while the child process is\\\\\\\\nsaving, Linux can\\'t tell in advance how much memory the child will take, so if\\\\\\\\nthe `overcommit_memory` setting is set to zero the fork will fail unless there is\\\\\\\\nas much free RAM as required to really duplicate all the parent memory pages.\\\\\\\\nIf you have a Redis dataset of 3 GB and just 2 GB of free\\\\\\\\nmemory it will fail.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSetting `overcommit_memory` to 1 tells Linux to relax and perform the fork in a\\\\\\\\nmore optimistic allocation fashion, and this is indeed what you want for Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can refer to the [proc(5)][proc5] man page for explanations of the\\\\\\\\navailable values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[proc5]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, the Redis background saving process is always forked when the server is\\\\\\\\noutside of the execution of a command, so every command reported to be atomic\\\\\\\\nin RAM is also atomic from the point of view of the disk snapshot.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_RUtT5xVxybKalqc5nE581S', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Based on the Redis documentation, here's how memory eviction works when `maxmemory` is set:\\n\\n## How Eviction Works\\n\\nWhen you set `maxmemory`, Redis monitors memory usage on every write command.

尝试执行 failover，但找不到合适的 slave 来提升为 master**。\n\n## 排查步骤\n\n### 1. 检查 slave 状态\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL replicas mymaster\n```\n\n查看所有 slave 的状态，重点关注：\n- `flags`: 是否包含 `s_down`（主观下线）或 `o_down`（客观下线）\n- `master-link-status`: 是否为 `ok`\n- `slave-priority`: 优先级（0 表示永不提升）\n\n### 2. 检查 slave 不合格的原因\n\nSentinel 认为 slave \"不合格\"的常见原因：\n\n**a) Slave 优先级为 0**\n```bash\nredis-cli -h <slave-ip> CONFIG GET slave-priority\n# 如果返回 0，该 slave 永远不会被提升\n```\n\n**b) Slave 复制延迟过大**\n```bash\nredis-cli -h <slave-ip> INFO replication\n# 检查 master_link_status 和 master_last_io_seconds_ago\n```\n\nSentinel 配置中的 `min-slaves-to-write` 和 `min-slaves-max-lag` 会影响判断。\n\n**c) Slave 主观下线**\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL ckquorum mymaster\n# 检查 Sentinel 对各节点的健康判断\n```\n\n### 3. 检查 Sentinel 配置\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 CONFIG GET min-slaves-*\n```\n\n关键参数：\n- `min-slaves-to-write`: 最少可用 slave 数量\n- `min-slaves-max-lag`: slave 最大复制延迟（秒）\n\n### 4. 查看 Sentinel 日志\n\n```bash\ngrep \"failover-abort\" /var/log/redis/sentinel.log\n```\n\n日志会详细说明为什么每个 slave 被拒绝。\n\n## 常见解决方案\n\n1. **修复 slave 复制延迟**：检查网络、磁盘 IO、master 写入压力\n2. **调整 slave-priority**：`redis-cli -h <slave-ip> CONFIG SET slave-priority 100`\n3. **降低 Sentinel 要求**：调整 `min-slaves-max-lag`（谨慎操作，可能导致数据丢失）\n4. **手动指定 slave**：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`（Sentinel 会尝试最佳 slave）\n\n## 引用来源\n\n- [来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 排查步骤]\n- [来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Sentinel

Since Sentinel is both responsible\\\\\\\\nfor reconfiguring instances during failovers, and providing configurations to\\\\\\\\nclients connecting to Redis masters or replicas, clients are required to have\\\\\\\\nexplicit support for Redis Sentinel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis document is targeted at Redis clients developers that want to support Sentinel in their clients implementation with the following goals:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Automatic configuration of clients via Sentinel.\\\\\\\\n* Improved safety of Redis Sentinel automatic failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor details about how Redis Sentinel works, please check the [Redis Documentation](), as this document only contains information needed for Redis client developers, and it is expected that readers are familiar with the way Redis Sentinel works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel identifies every master with a name like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stats\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\nEvery name actually identifies a *group of instances*, composed of a master\\\\\\\\nand a variable number of replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe address of the Redis master that is used for a specific purpose inside a network may change after events like an automatic failover, a manually triggered failover (for instance in order to upgrade a Redis instance), and other reasons.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally Redis clients have some kind of hard-coded configuration that specifies the address of a Redis master instance within a network as IP address and port number. However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel. So instead of a hard coded IP address and port, a client supporting Sentinel should optionally be able to take as input:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A list of ip:port pairs pointing to known Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* The name of the service, like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"timelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the procedure a client should follow in order to obtain the master address starting from the list of Sentinels and the service name.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.1331,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-027\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Algorithms and internals > Configuration propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Once a Sentinel is able to failover a master successfully, it will start to broadcast the new configuration so that the other Sentinels will update their information about a given master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor a failover to be considered successful, it requires that the Sentinel was able to send the `REPLICAOF NO ONE` command to the selected replica, and that the switch to master was later observed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) output of the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt this point, even if the reconfiguration of the replicas is in progress, the failover is considered to be successful, and all the Sentinels are required to start reporting the new configuration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe way a new configuration is propagated is the reason why we need that every\\\\\\\\nSentinel failover is authorized with a different version number (configuration epoch).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery Sentinel continuously broadcast its version of the configuration of a master using Redis Pub/Sub messages, both in the master and all the replicas.  At the same time all the Sentinels wait for messages to see what is the configuration\\\\\\\\nadvertised by the other Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfigurations are broadcast in the `__sentinel__:hello` Pub/Sub channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause every configuration has a different version number, the greater version\\\\\\\\nalways wins over smaller versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example the configuration for the master `mymaster` start with all the\\\\\\\\nSentinels believing the master is at 192.168.1.50:6379. This configuration\\\\\\\\nhas version 1. After some time a Sentinel is authorized to failover with version 2. If the failover is successful, it will start to broadcast a new configuration, let\\'s say 192.168.1.50:9000, with version 2. All the other instances will see this configuration and will update their configuration accordingly, since the new configuration has a greater version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that Sentinel guarantees a second liveness property: a set of\\\\\\\\nSentinels that are able to communicate will all converge to the same configuration with the higher version number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically if the net is partitioned, every partition will converge to the higher\\\\\\\\nlocal configuration. In the special case of no partitions, there is a single\\\\\\\\npartition and every Sentinel will agree about the configuration.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.2785,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/runbook/redis-failover.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册 > 故障现象\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"当 Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换（failover）后，应用层需要正确处理连接重建。本文档描述完整的故障恢复流程。\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- 应用日志出现大量 `READONLY You can\\'t write against a read only replica` 错误\\\\\\\\n- Sentinel 日志显示 `+switch-master` 事件\\\\\\\\n- 监控告警：Redis 写入延迟突增\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.2839,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel quick start > Configuring Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis source distribution contains a file called `sentinel.conf`\\\\\\\\nthat is a self-documented example configuration file you can use to\\\\\\\\nconfigure Sentinel, however a typical minimal configuration file looks like the\\\\\\\\nfollowing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2\\\\\\\\n    sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 60000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor resque 192.168.1.3 6380 4\\\\\\\\n    sentinel down-after-milliseconds resque 10000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel failover-timeout resque 180000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel parallel-syncs resque 5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou only need to specify the masters to monitor, giving to each separated\\\\\\\\nmaster (that may have any number of replicas) a different name. There is no\\\\\\\\nneed to specify replicas, which are auto-discovered. Sentinel will update the\\\\\\\\nconfiguration automatically with additional information about replicas (in\\\\\\\\norder to retain the information in case of restart). The configuration is\\\\\\\\nalso rewritten every time a replica is promoted to master during a failover\\\\\\\\nand every time a new Sentinel is discovered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe example configuration above basically monitors two sets of Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances, each composed of a master and an undefined number of replicas.\\\\\\\\nOne set of instances is called `mymaster`, and the other `resque`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe meaning of the arguments of `sentinel monitor` statements is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <port> <quorum>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the sake of clarity, let\\'s check line by line what the configuration\\\\\\\\noptions mean:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first line is used to tell Redis to monitor a master called *mymaster*,\\\\\\\\nthat is at address 127.0.0.1 and port 6379, with a quorum of 2. Everything\\\\\\\\nis pretty obvious but the **quorum** argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The **quorum** is the number of Sentinels that need to agree about the fact the master is not reachable, in order to really mark the master as failing, and eventually start a failover procedure if possible.\\\\\\\\n* However **the quorum is only used to detect the failure**. In order to actually perform a failover, one of the Sentinels need to be elected leader for the failover and be authorized to proceed. This only happens with the vote of the **majority of the Sentinel processes**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example if you have 5 Sentinel processes, and the quorum for a given\\\\\\\\nmaster set to the value of 2, this is what happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If two Sentinels agree at the same time about the master being unreachable, one of the two will try to start a failover.\\\\\\\\n* If there are at least a total of three Sentinels reachable, the failover will be authorized and will actually start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn practical terms this means during failures **Sentinel never starts a failover if the majority of Sentinel processes are unable to talk** (aka no failover in the minority partition).\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='找到了相关文档。让我读取本地的 Redis 故障恢复手册获取完整信息。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_iO8rz2m6CsoR6OW5efI49P', name='Read', input={'file_path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/runbook/redis-failover.md'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_iO8rz2m6CsoR6OW5efI49P', content=\"     1→---\\n     2→id: redis-failover-001\\n     3→title: Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\n     4→owner: sre-team\\n     5→tags: [redis, failover, runbook, 高可用]\\n     6→created: 2025-02-13\\n     7→last_reviewed: 2025-02-13\\n     8→confidence: high\\n     9→---\\n    10→\\n    11→# Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\n    12→\\n    13→## 概述\\n    14→\\n    15→当 Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换（failover）后，应用层需要正确处理连接重建。本文档描述完整的故障恢复流程。\\n    16→\\n    17→## 故障现象\\n    18→\\n    19→- 应用日志出现大量 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\\n    20→- Sentinel 日志显示 `+switch-master` 事件\\n    21→- 监控告警：Redis 写入延迟突增\\n    22→\\n    23→## 排查步骤\\n    24→\\n    25→### 1. 确认 Sentinel 状态\\n    26→\\n    27→```bash\\n    28→redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n    29→redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n    30→```\\n    31→\\n    32→确认新 master 的 IP 和端口。\\n    33→\\n    34→### 2. 检查新 master 状态\\n    35→\\n    36→```bash\\n    37→redis-cli -h <new-master-ip> -p 6379 INFO replication\\n    38→```\\n    39→\\n    40→确认 `role:master`，检查 `connected_slaves` 数量。\\n    41→\\n    42→### 3. 检查应用连接池\\n    43→\\n    44→确认应用是否已经切换到新 master：\\n    45→\\n    46→```bash\\n    47→# 查看应用连接数\\n    48→redis-cli -h <new-master-ip> CLIENT LIST | wc -l\\n    49→```\\n    50→\\n    51→## 恢复操作\\n    52→\\n    53→### 自动恢复（推荐）\\n    54→\\n    55→如果应用使用 Sentinel 客户端（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会自动切换。检查：\\n    56→\\n    57→1. 确认客户端配置了 Sentinel 地址而非直连 master\\n    58→2. 确认连接池的 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置已开启\\n    59→3. 等待 30 秒，观察错误率是否下降\\n    60→\\n    61→### 手动恢复\\n    62→\\n    63→如果应用直连 master IP：\\n    64→\\n    65→1. 获取新 master 地址：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\\n    66→2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\\n    67→3. 滚动重启应用 Pod\\n    68→\\n    69→```bash\\n    70→kubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\\n    71→```\\n    72→\\n    73→## 预防措施\\n    74→\\n    75→- 所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\\n    76→- 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\\n    77→- 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\\n    78→\\n    79→## 相关文档\\n    80→\\n    81→- Redis Sentinel 架构设计\\n    82→- 应用连接池配置规范\\n    83→\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

I found the exact information you need. The CROSSSLOT error occurs because **SORT** and **SUNION** are multi-key operations that require all keys to be in the same hash slot when running in Redis Cluster mode.\n\n## The Problem\n\nIn Redis Cluster, commands like `SORT` and `SUNION` (set unions/intersections) are **single-slot operations** — they only work when all keys involved hash to the same slot. If your keys are distributed across different nodes, you'll get a CROSSSLOT error.\n\nFrom the documentation:\n\n> \"Redis Cluster implements all the single key commands available in the non-distributed version of Redis. Commands performing complex multi-key operations like set unions and intersections are implemented for cases where **all of the keys involved in the operation hash to the same slot**.\"\n\n## The Solution: Hash Tags\n\nUse **hash tags** to force keys into the same hash slot. Hash tags use curly braces `{...}` — only the content inside the braces is used for hash calculation.\n\n### Example:\n\n**Won't work (CROSSSLOT error):**\n```redis\nSUNION group:1 group:2\nSORT mylist BY weight:* GET object:*\n```\n\n**Will work (same hash slot):**\n```redis\nSUNION {group}:1 {group}:2\nSORT {mydata}:list BY {mydata}:weight:* GET {mydata}:object:*\n```\n\n### How Hash Tags Work:\n\n- `{user:1000}.name` and `{user:1000}.followers` → both hash to the same slot (only `user:1000` is hashed)\n- `person:1` and `person:2` → different slots\n- `{person}:1` and `{person}:2` → same slot (only `person` is hashed)\n\n### Check Hash Slots:\n\n```redis\nCLUSTER KEYSLOT mykey        # See which slot a key belongs to\nCLUSTER KEYSLOT {tag}:key1   # Verify hash tag works\n```\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n1. **Performance trade-off**: Concentrating too many keys in the same hash slot can create hotspots and harm performance\n2. **During resharding**: Multi-key operations may temporarily fail with `-TRYAGAIN` errors while hash slots are being moved\n3. **Read-only operations**: Commands like `SUNION`, `SINTER`, `SDIFF` are read-only but still require single-slot in cluster mode\n4. **Write operations**: Commands like `SUNIONSTORE`, `SINTERSTORE`, `SDIFFSTORE` also require single-slot\n\n[来源:

The idea is that in a cluster with\\\\\\\\na master-replica setup, if the map between replicas and masters is fixed\\\\\\\\navailability is limited over time if multiple independent failures of single\\\\\\\\nnodes happen.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example in a cluster where every master has a single replica, the cluster\\\\\\\\ncan continue operations as long as either the master or the replica fail, but not\\\\\\\\nif both fail the same time. However there is a class of failures that are\\\\\\\\nthe independent failures of single nodes caused by hardware or software issues\\\\\\\\nthat can accumulate over time. For example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A has a single replica A1.\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted as new master.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails in an independent manner (unrelated to the failure of A). No other replica is available for promotion since node A is still down. The cluster cannot continue normal operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the map between masters and replicas is fixed, the only way to make the cluster\\\\\\\\nmore resistant to the above scenario is to add replicas to every master, however\\\\\\\\nthis is costly as it requires more instances of Redis to be executed, more\\\\\\\\nmemory, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn alternative is to create an asymmetry in the cluster, and let the cluster\\\\\\\\nlayout automatically change over time. For example the cluster may have three\\\\\\\\nmasters A, B, C. A and B have a single replica each, A1 and B1. However the master\\\\\\\\nC is different and has two replicas: C1 and C2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReplica migration is the process of automatic reconfiguration of a replica\\\\\\\\nin order to *migrate* to a master that has no longer coverage (no working\\\\\\\\nreplicas). With replica migration the scenario mentioned above turns into the\\\\\\\\nfollowing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted.\\\\\\\\n* C2 migrates as replica of A1, that is otherwise not backed by any replica.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails as well.\\\\\\\\n* C2 is promoted as new master to replace A1.\\\\\\\\n* The cluster can continue the operations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.4951,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Key distribution model\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The cluster\\'s key space is split into 16384 slots, effectively setting an upper limit\\\\\\\\nfor the cluster size of 16384 master nodes (however, the suggested max size of\\\\\\\\nnodes is on the order of ~ 1000 nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach master node in a cluster handles a subset of the 16384 hash slots.\\\\\\\\nThe cluster is **stable** when there is no cluster reconfiguration in\\\\\\\\nprogress (i.e. where hash slots are being moved from one node to another).\\\\\\\\nWhen the cluster is stable, a single hash slot will be served by a single node\\\\\\\\n(however the serving node can have one or more replicas that will replace it in the case of net splits or failures,\\\\\\\\nand that can be used in order to scale read operations where reading stale data is acceptable).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe base algorithm used to map keys to hash slots is the following\\\\\\\\n(read the next paragraph for the hash tag exception to this rule):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe CRC16 is specified as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\\\\\\\\n* Width: 16 bit\\\\\\\\n* Poly: 1021 (That is actually x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\\\\\\\\n* Initialization: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Input byte: False\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Output CRC: False\\\\\\\\n* Xor constant to output CRC: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Output for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"123456789\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 31C3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n14 out of 16 CRC16 output bits are used (this is why there is\\\\\\\\na modulo 16384 operation in the formula above).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our tests CRC16 behaved remarkably well in distributing different kinds of\\\\\\\\nkeys evenly across the 16384 slots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note**: A reference implementation of the CRC16 algorithm used is available in the Appendix A of this document.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Based on the search results, I found information about Redis Cluster architecture but not specific documentation about CROSSSLOT errors.

For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5972,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Main properties and rationales of the design > Implemented subset\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster is a distributed implementation of Redis with the following goals in order of importance in the design:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* High performance and linear scalability up to 1000 nodes.

Windows to lose acknowledged writes are larger when clients are in a minority partition.\\\\\\\\n* Availability: Redis Cluster is able to survive partitions where the majority of the master nodes are reachable and there is at least one reachable replica for every master node that is no longer reachable.

You can select the\\\\\\\\nsection of the key you want to hash using a pair of curly braces `{...}` to create\\\\\\\\na *hashtag*. For example, the keys `person:1` and `person:2` produce different\\\\\\\\nhash indices but `{person}:1` and `{person}:2` produce the same index because\\\\\\\\nonly the `person` hashtag section in the braces is used for the hash calculation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA common use of hashtags is to allow\\\\\\\\n[multi-key operations]()\\\\\\\\nwith a *clustered* database (see\\\\\\\\n[Database clustering]()\\\\\\\\nfor more information). Redis doesn\\'t allow most multi-key operations in a clustered database\\\\\\\\nunless all the keys produce the same hash index.

Here's what's likely happening and how to fix it:\n\n## Root Cause\n\nDuring AOF rewrite, Redis forks a child process that writes to a **temporary file** before atomically replacing the old AOF. The error occurs when:\n\n1. **Permission denied** on the AOF directory (`appenddirname`)\n2. **File ownership mismatch** (Redis process can't write to the directory)\n3. **SELinux/AppArmor restrictions** blocking file creation\n4. **Parent directory doesn't exist** or is inaccessible\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n### 1. Check Directory Permissions\n```bash\n# Find your AOF directory (default: appendonlydir/)\nredis-cli CONFIG GET appenddirname\n\n# Check permissions\nls -ld /path/to/redis/appendonlydir/\nls -l /path/to/redis/appendonlydir/\n\n# Should be owned by Redis user (e.g., redis:redis)\n```\n\n### 2. Fix Permissions\n```bash\n# If Redis runs as 'redis' user\nchown -R redis:redis /path/to/appendonlydir/\nchmod 755 /path/to/appendonlydir/\n```\n\n### 3. Check Redis Logs for Details\n```bash\n# Look for the exact error\ntail -f /var/log/redis/redis-server.log\n```\n\n### 4. Verify AOF Configuration\n```bash\nredis-cli INFO persistence\n# Check: aof_last_bgrewrite_status, aof_rewrite_in_progress\n```\n\n## How AOF Rewrite Works (Redis >= 7.0)\n\nThe rewrite process creates temporary files that need write permissions:\n\n1. Child process writes new **base AOF** to a temporary file\n2. Parent opens a new **increment AOF** file\n3. On success, Redis does atomic manifest exchange\n4. Old files are cleaned up\n\nIf the child can't create the temp file → rewrite fails with \"Can't open\" error.\n\n## Additional Checks\n\n- **Inode exhaustion**: `df -i` (even if disk has space, inodes might be full)\n- **Read-only filesystem**: `mount | grep redis`\n- **SELinux denials**: `ausearch -m avc -ts recent | grep redis`\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md > Append-only file > How it works]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["AOF", "rewrite", "append", "search"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "b03cdf00-08e1-4d47-b77a-97e0c86da412", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "acdf3b28-417b-436b-a77c-32bed4821588", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='I\\'ll search for information about Redis AOF rewrite failures with the \"Can\\'t open the append-only file\" error.')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_sbSwZrJMO7k29Ek9HJJSym', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': \"Can't open the append-only file|AOF rewrite|appendonly\"})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_npLayOe1ienQVvOMJlBe7W', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': \"Redis AOF rewrite failing can't open append-only file permission error\", 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_sbSwZrJMO7k29Ek9HJJSym', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_npLayOe1ienQVvOMJlBe7W', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8572,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Append-only file > How it works\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Log rewriting uses the same copy-on-write trick already in use for\\\\\\\\nsnapshotting.

However, if this is done during a [rewrite](#log-rewriting), you might end up with an invalid backup.\\\\\\\\nTo work around this you must disable AOF rewrites during the backup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Turn off automatic rewrites with<br/>\\\\\\\\n   [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) `auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 0`<br/>\\\\\\\\n   Make sure you don\\'t manually start a rewrite (using [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof)) during this time.\\\\\\\\n2. Check there\\'s no current rewrite in progress using<br/>\\\\\\\\n   [`INFO`](/commands/info) `persistence`<br/>\\\\\\\\n   and verifying `aof_rewrite_in_progress` is 0. If it\\'s 1, then you\\'ll need to wait for the rewrite to complete.\\\\\\\\n3. Now you can safely copy the files in the `appenddirname` directory.\\\\\\\\n4. Re-enable rewrites when done:<br/>\\\\\\\\n   [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) `auto-aof-rewrite-percentage <prev-value>`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:** If you want to minimize the time AOF rewrites are disabled you may create hard links to the files in `appenddirname` (in step 3 above) and then re-enable rewrites (step 4) after the hard links are created.\\\\\\\\nNow you can copy/tar the hardlinks and delete them when done. This works because Redis guarantees that it\\\\\\\\nonly appends to files in this directory, or completely replaces them if necessary, so the content should be\\\\\\\\nconsistent at any given point in time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:** If you want to handle the case of the server being restarted during the backup and make sure no rewrite will automatically start after the restart you can change step 1 above to also persist the updated configuration via [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite).\\\\\\\\nJust make sure to re-enable automatic rewrites when done (step 4) and persist it with another [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior to version 7.0.0 backing up the AOF file can be done simply by copying the aof file (like backing up the RDB snapshot).

you\\\\\\\\nare experiencing latency problems with Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this context *latency* is the maximum delay between the time a client\\\\\\\\nissues a command and the time the reply to the command is received by the\\\\\\\\nclient. Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for. However\\\\\\\\nthere is not just a single swap field since the smaps file contains the\\\\\\\\ndifferent memory maps of our Redis process (The memory layout of a process\\\\\\\\nis more complex than a simple linear array of pages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince we are interested in all the memory swapped by our process the first thing\\\\\\\\nto do is to grep for the Swap field across all the file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | grep \\'Swap:\\'\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf everything is 0 kB, or if there are sporadic 4k entries, everything is\\\\\\\\nperfectly normal. Actually in our example instance (the one of a real web\\\\\\\\nsite running Redis and serving hundreds of users every second) there are a\\\\\\\\nfew entries that show more swapped pages.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server.

Here's how to do it:\n\n## Sliding Window Rate Limiter with Redis Sorted Sets\n\nRedis sorted sets are specifically designed for rate limiting use cases. The key insight is to use **timestamps as scores** and track requests within a time window.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n1. **Use timestamps as scores**: Each API request is added to a sorted set with the current timestamp as its score\n2. **Remove old entries**: Delete entries outside the time window using `ZREMRANGEBYSCORE`\n3. **Count current requests**: Use `ZCARD` to count requests in the current window\n4. **Check limit**: Compare count against your rate limit threshold\n\n### Basic Algorithm\n\n```redis\n# Example: Allow 100 requests per minute per user\n\n# 1. Get current timestamp (in milliseconds)\ncurrent_time = current_timestamp_ms()\nwindow_start = current_time - 60000  # 60 seconds ago\n\n# 2. Remove expired entries (older than 1 minute)\nZREMRANGEBYSCORE rate_limiter:user:123 -inf window_start\n\n# 3. Count requests in current window\nrequest_count = ZCARD rate_limiter:user:123\n\n# 4. Check if under limit\nif request_count < 100:\n    # 5. Add current request\n    ZADD rate_limiter:user:123 current_time request_id\n    # Allow request\nelse:\n    # Reject request - rate limit exceeded\n```\n\n### Key Commands\n\n- **`ZADD`**: Add new request with timestamp as score\n- **`ZREMRANGEBYSCORE`**: Remove entries outside the time window\n- **`ZCARD`**: Count total requests in current window\n- **`ZRANGE`** or **`ZRANGEBYSCORE`**: Query requests within specific time ranges\n\n### Why Sorted Sets Work Well\n\n- **Automatic ordering**: Elements are automatically sorted by timestamp (score)\n- **Efficient range operations**: `ZREMRANGEBYSCORE` removes old entries in O(log(N) + M) time\n- **Fast counting**: `ZCARD` returns count in O(1) time\n- **Atomic operations**: Can be wrapped in `MULTI/EXEC` for atomicity\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- Set an expiration on the sorted set key using `EXPIRE` to prevent memory leaks\n- Use unique request IDs as members (e.g., `request_id` or `user_id:timestamp`)\n- For distributed systems, consider using Lua scripts to ensure atomicity\n\n[Source: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md > Redis sorted sets]", "tools_used":

score.\\\\\\\\nWhen more than one string has the same score, the strings are ordered lexicographically.\\\\\\\\nSome use cases for sorted sets include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Leaderboards. For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted.

As such, sorted sets are suitable\\\\\\\\nwhen there are tons of updates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of this characteristic a common use case is leaderboards.\\\\\\\\nThe typical application is a Facebook game where you combine the ability to\\\\\\\\ntake users sorted by their high score, plus the get-rank operation, in order\\\\\\\\nto show the top-N users, and the user rank in the leader board (e.g., \\\\\\\\\\\\\"you are\\\\\\\\nthe #4932 best score here\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.752,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Learn more\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* There are two ways we can use a sorted set to represent a leaderboard. If we know a racer\\'s new score, we can update it directly via the [`ZADD`]() command. However, if we want to add points to an existing score, we can use the [`ZINCRBY`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 100 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wood\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 100 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 150 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> ZINCRBY racer_scores 50 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wood\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"150\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZINCRBY racer_scores 50 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"200\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll see that [`ZADD`]() returns 0 when the member already exists (the score is updated), while [`ZINCRBY`]() returns the new score. The score for racer Henshaw went from 100, was changed to 150 with no regard for what score was there before, and then was incremented by 50 to 200.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`ZADD`]() adds a new member and associated score to a sorted set. If the member already exists, the score is updated.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZRANGE`]() returns members of a sorted set, sorted within a given range.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZRANK`]() returns the rank of the provided member, assuming the sorted set is in ascending order.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZREVRANK`]() returns the rank of the provided member, assuming the sorted set is in descending order.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of sorted set commands](?group=sorted-set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost sorted set operations are O(log(n)), where _n_ is the number of members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExercise some caution when running the [`ZRANGE`]() command with large returns values (e.g., in the tens of thousands or more).\\\\\\\\nThis command\\'s time complexity is O(log(n) + m), where _m_ is the number of results returned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis sorted sets are sometimes used for indexing other Redis data structures.\\\\\\\\nIf you need to index and query your data, consider the [JSON]() data type and the [Redis Query Engine]() features.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Redis Sorted Sets Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUKlxdBQZ7g) is an entertaining introduction to sorted sets in Redis.\\\\\\\\n* [Redis University\\'s RU101](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/) explores Redis sorted sets in detail.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4312,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples > What are Lists?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To explain the List data type it\\'s better to start with a little bit of theory,\\\\\\\\nas the term *List* is often used in an improper way by information technology\\\\\\\\nfolks. For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4041,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Limits\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The [`SADD`]() command adds new elements to a set. It\\'s also possible\\\\\\\\nto do a number of other operations against sets like testing if a given element\\\\\\\\nalready exists, performing the intersection, union or difference between\\\\\\\\nmultiple sets, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> SMEMBERS bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) bike:3\\\\\\\\n2) bike:1\\\\\\\\n3) bike:2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere I\\'ve added three elements to my set and told Redis to return all the\\\\\\\\nelements. There is no order guarantee with a set. Redis is free to return the\\\\\\\\nelements in any order at every call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has commands to test for set membership. These commands can be used on single as well as multiple items:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> SISMEMBER bikes:racing:france bike:1\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SMISMEMBER bikes:racing:france bike:2 bike:3 bike:4\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can also find the difference between two sets. For instance, we may want\\\\\\\\nto know which bikes are racing in France but not in the USA:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:usa bike:1 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are other non trivial operations that are still easy to implement\\\\\\\\nusing the right Redis commands. For instance we may want a list of all the\\\\\\\\nbikes racing in France, the USA, and some other races. We can do this using\\\\\\\\nthe [`SINTER`]() command, which performs the intersection between different\\\\\\\\nsets. In addition to intersection you can also perform\\\\\\\\nunions, difference, and more. For example \\\\\\\\nif we add a third race we can see some of these commands in action:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:usa bike:1 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:italy bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> SINTER bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SUNION bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(empty array)\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll note that the [`SDIFF`]() command returns an empty array when the\\\\\\\\ndifference between all sets is empty. You\\'ll also note that the order of sets\\\\\\\\npassed to [`SDIFF`]() matters, since the difference is not commutative.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you want to remove items from a set, you can use the [`SREM`]() command to\\\\\\\\nremove one or more items from a set, or you can use the [`SPOP`]() command to\\\\\\\\nremove a random item from a set. You can also _return_ a random item from a\\\\\\\\nset without removing it using the [`SRANDMEMBER`]() command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> SREM bikes:racing:france bike:1\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SPOP bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SMEMBERS bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SRANDMEMBER bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe max size of a Redis set is 2^32 - 1 (4,294,967,295) members.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.2768,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Operating on ranges\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Sorted sets are more powerful than this.

默认是关闭的，需要通过以下方式启用：\n\n**方式 1：修改 redis.conf**\n```\nnotify-keyspace-events Ex\n```\n\n**方式 2：运行时配置**\n```bash\nCONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events Ex\n```\n\n## 监听 key 过期事件的配置\n\n要监听 key 过期事件，配置参数需要包含：\n- `E` - 启用 Keyevent 事件（发布到 `__keyevent@<db>__` 前缀的频道）\n- `x` - 过期事件（每次 key 过期时生成）\n\n所以最简配置是 `Ex`。\n\n## 配置参数说明\n\n| 字符 | 含义 |\n|------|------|\n| K | Keyspace 事件（`__keyspace@<db>__` 前缀） |\n| E | Keyevent 事件（`__keyevent@<db>__` 前缀） |\n| x | 过期事件 |\n| g | 通用命令（DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME 等） |\n| $ | String 命令 |\n| l | List 命令 |\n| s | Set 命令 |\n| h | Hash 命令 |\n| z | Sorted Set 命令 |\n| A | 别名，等同于 \"g$lshztdxe\" |\n\n**注意**：至少需要包含 `K` 或 `E` 之一，否则不会发送任何事件。\n\n## 订阅示例\n\n配置完成后，可以这样订阅过期事件：\n\n```bash\n# 订阅 database 0 的所有过期事件\nSUBSCRIBE __keyevent@0__:expired\n\n# 或者订阅特定 key 的所有事件\nSUBSCRIBE __keyspace@0__:mykey\n```\n\n## 重要提示\n\n⚠️ **过期事件的触发时机**：\n- 当 key 被访问时发现已过期\n- 后台系统定期扫描过期 key\n\n这意味着从 TTL 到达 0 到触发 `expired` 事件之间可能有延迟，特别是当 key 从未被访问且有大量带 TTL 的 key 时。\n\n⚠️ **集群环境**：在 Redis Cluster 中，keyspace 事件不会广播到所有节点，每个节点只发送自己管理的 keyspace 的事件。如需接收所有事件，需要订阅每个节点。\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/pubsub/keyspace-notifications.md > Configuration, Type of events, Events

It was designed specifically for Redis but can be used for other client-server software projects.\n\nRESP is a compromise among three key considerations:\n- Simple to implement\n- Fast to parse  \n- Human readable\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n- **Binary-safe**: Uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data without requiring special character processing\n- **Multiple versions**: RESP2 (standard since Redis 2.0), RESP3 (introduced in Redis 6.0)\n- **Type system**: Can serialize integers, strings, arrays, and includes an error-specific type\n- **ASCII-based control sequences**: Uses `\\r\\n` (CRLF) as the protocol terminator\n\n## How Client-Server Communication Works\n\n### Connection Setup\n1. Client creates a TCP connection to Redis server (default port 6379)\n2. New connections should begin with the `HELLO` command to negotiate protocol version and get server info\n\n### Request-Response Model\n\n**Client sends commands as:**\n- An array of bulk strings\n- First element is the command name\n- Subsequent elements are arguments\n\n**Server replies with:**\n- Any valid RESP data type (determined by the command)\n\n### Example Communication\n\nFor the command `LLEN mylist`:\n\n```\nClient: *2\\r\\n$4\\r\\nLLEN\\r\\n$6\\r\\nmylist\\r\\n\nServer: :48293\\r\\n\n```\n\nBreaking this down:\n- `*2` = array with 2 elements\n- `$4\\r\\nLLEN` = bulk string \"LLEN\" (4 bytes)\n- `$6\\r\\nmylist` = bulk string \"mylist\" (6 bytes)\n- `:48293` = integer reply\n\n### RESP Data Types\n\nEach type is identified by its first byte:\n\n| Type | First Byte | Example |\n|------|-----------|---------|\n| Simple strings | `+` | `+OK\\r\\n` |\n| Errors | `-` | `-ERR unknown command\\r\\n` |\n| Integers | `:` | `:1000\\r\\n` |\n| Bulk strings | `$` | `$5\\r\\nhello\\r\\n` |\n| Arrays | `*` | `*2\\r\\n$3\\r\\nfoo\\r\\n$3\\r\\nbar\\r\\n` |\n\n### Advanced Features\n\n**Pipelining**: Clients can send multiple commands without waiting for each reply, then read all replies at the end. This reduces round-trip time (RTT) overhead.\n\n**Exceptions to request-response**:\n- Pub/Sub mode (becomes push protocol)\n- `MONITOR` command (ad-hoc push mode)\n- RESP3 push types (out-of-band

communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client

protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is

supports several data types.\\\\\\\\nIn RESP, the first byte of data determines its type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis generally uses RESP as a [request-response](#request-response-model) protocol in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients send commands to a Redis server as an [array](#arrays) of [bulk strings](#bulk-strings).\\\\\\\\n  The first (and sometimes also the second) bulk string in the array is the command\\'s name.\\\\\\\\n  Subsequent elements of the array are the arguments for the command.\\\\\\\\n* The server replies with a RESP type.\\\\\\\\n  The reply\\'s type is determined by the command\\'s implementation and possibly by the client\\'s protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a binary protocol that uses control sequences encoded in standard ASCII.\\\\\\\\nThe `A` character, for example, is encoded with the binary byte of value 65.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the characters CR (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`), LF (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) and SP (` `) have binary byte values of 13, 10 and 32, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` (CRLF) is the protocol\\'s _terminator_, which **always** separates its parts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first byte in an RESP-serialized payload always identifies its type.\\\\\\\\nSubsequent bytes constitute the type\\'s contents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe categorize every RESP data type as either _simple_, _bulk_ or _aggregate_.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimple types are similar to scalars in programming languages that represent plain literal values. Booleans and Integers are such examples.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP strings are either _simple_ or _bulk_.\\\\\\\\nSimple strings never contain carriage return (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`) or line feed (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) characters.\\\\\\\\nBulk strings can contain any binary data and may also be referred to as _binary_ or _blob_.\\\\\\\\nNote that bulk strings may be further encoded and decoded, e.g. with a wide multi-byte encoding, by the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAggregates, such as Arrays and Maps, can have varying numbers of sub-elements and nesting levels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following table summarizes the RESP data types that Redis supports:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| RESP data type | Minimal protocol version | Category | First byte |\\\\\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\\\\\n| [Simple strings](#simple-strings) | RESP2 | Simple | `+` |\\\\\\\\n| [Simple Errors](#simple-errors) | RESP2 | Simple | `-` |\\\\\\\\n| [Integers](#integers) | RESP2 | Simple | `:` |\\\\\\\\n| [Bulk strings](#bulk-strings) | RESP2 | Aggregate | `$` |\\\\\\\\n| [Arrays](#arrays) | RESP2 | Aggregate | `*` |\\\\\\\\n| [Nulls](#nulls) | RESP3 | Simple | `_` |\\\\\\\\n| [Booleans](#booleans) | RESP3 | Simple | `#` |\\\\\\\\n| [Doubles](#doubles) | RESP3 | Simple | `,` |\\\\\\\\n| [Big numbers](#big-numbers) | RESP3 | Simple | `(` |\\\\\\\\n| [Bulk errors](#bulk-errors) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `!` |\\\\\\\\n| [Verbatim strings](#verbatim-strings) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `=` |\\\\\\\\n| [Maps](#maps) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `%` |\\\\\\\\n| [Attributes](#attributes) | RESP3 | Aggregate | <code>&#124;</code> |\\\\\\\\n| [Sets](#sets) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `~` |\\\\\\\\n| [Pushes](#pushes) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `>` |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"simple-string-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.1516,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/protocol-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis serialization protocol specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sending commands to a Redis server\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"New RESP connections should begin the session by calling the [`HELLO`]() command.\\\\\\\\nThis practice accomplishes two things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. It allows servers to be backward compatible with RESP2 versions.\\\\\\\\n  This is needed in Redis to make the transition to version 3 of the protocol gentler.\\\\\\\\n2. The [`HELLO`]() command returns information about the server and the protocol that the client can use for different goals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`HELLO`]() command has the following high-level syntax:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HELLO <protocol-version> [optional-arguments]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first argument of the command is the protocol version we want the connection to be set.\\\\\\\\nBy default, the connection starts in RESP2 mode.\\\\\\\\nIf we specify a connection version that is too big and unsupported by the server, it should reply with a `-NOPROTO` error. Example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 4\\\\\\\\n    Server: -NOPROTO sorry, this protocol version is not supported.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\nAt that point, the client may retry with a lower protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the client can easily detect a server that is only able to speak RESP2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR unknown command \\'HELLO\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client can then proceed and use RESP2 to communicate with the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that even if the protocol\\'s version is supported, the [`HELLO`]() command may return an error, perform no action and remain in RESP2 mode. \\\\\\\\nFor example, when used with invalid authentication credentials in the command\\'s optional `AUTH` clause:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3 AUTH default mypassword\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR invalid password\\\\\\\\n    (the connection remains in RESP2 mode)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA successful reply to the [`HELLO`]() command is a map reply.\\\\\\\\nThe information in the reply is partly server-dependent, but certain fields are mandatory for all the RESP3 implementations:\\\\\\\\n* **server**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"redis\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (or other software name).\\\\\\\\n* **version**: the server\\'s version.\\\\\\\\n* **proto**: the highest supported version of the RESP protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis\\' RESP3 implementation, the following fields are also emitted:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **id**: the connection\\'s identifier (ID).\\\\\\\\n* **mode**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"standalone\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cluster\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **role**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"master\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"replica\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **modules**: list of loaded modules as an Array of Bulk Strings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that you are familiar with the RESP serialization format, you can use it to help write a Redis client library.\\\\\\\\nWe can further specify how the interaction between the client and the server works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A client sends the Redis server an [array](#arrays) consisting of only bulk strings.\\\\\\\\n* A Redis server replies to clients, sending any valid RESP data type as a reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, for example, a typical interaction could be the following.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client sends the command `LLEN mylist` to get the length of the list stored at the key _mylist_.\\\\\\\\nThen the server replies with an [integer](#integers) reply as in the following example (`C:` is the client, `S:` the server).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C:

different parts of the protocol with newlines for simplicity, but the actual interaction is the client sending `*2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLLEN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nmylist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` as a

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Clients send commands to the Redis server as RESP arrays.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, some Redis commands that return collections of elements use arrays as their replies. \\\\\\\\nAn example is the [`LRANGE`]() command that returns elements of a list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP Arrays\\' encoding uses the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *<number-of-elements>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n<element-1>...<element-n>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An asterisk (`*`) as the first byte.\\\\\\\\n* One or more decimal digits (`0`..`9`) as the number of elements in the array as an unsigned, base-10 value.\\\\\\\\n* The CRLF terminator.\\\\\\\\n* An additional RESP type for every element of the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo an empty Array is just the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhereas the encoding of an array consisting of the two bulk strings \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"world\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nhello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nworld\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see, after the `*<count>CRLF` part prefixing the array, the other data types that compose the array are concatenated one after the other.\\\\\\\\nFor example, an Array of three integers is encoded as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArrays can contain mixed data types.\\\\\\\\nFor instance, the following encoding is of a list of four integers and a bulk string:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(The raw RESP encoding is split into multiple lines for readability).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first line the server sent is `*5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`.\\\\\\\\nThis numeric value tells the client that five reply types are about to follow it.\\\\\\\\nThen, every successive reply constitutes an element in the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of the aggregate RESP types support nesting.\\\\\\\\nFor example, a nested array of two arrays is encoded as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n

-World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(The raw RESP encoding is split into multiple lines for readability).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above encodes a two-element array.\\\\\\\\nThe first element is an array that, in turn, contains three integers (1, 2, 3).\\\\\\\\nThe second element is another array containing a simple string and an error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn some places, the RESP Array type may be referred to as _multi bulk_.\\\\\\\\nThe two are the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nil-array-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n

multiple commands.\\\\\\\\nPipelining is supported, so multiple commands can be sent with a single write operation by the client.\\\\\\\\nThe client can skip reading replies and continue to send the commands one after the other.\\\\\\\\nAll the replies can be read at the end.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more information, see [Pipelining]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes you may need to send a command to the Redis server but only have `telnet` available.\\\\\\\\nWhile the Redis protocol is simple to implement, it is not ideal for interactive sessions, and `redis-cli` may not always be available.\\\\\\\\nFor this reason, Redis also accepts commands in the _inline command_ format.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following example demonstrates a server/client exchange using an inline command (the server chat starts with `S:`, the client chat with `C:`):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: PING\\\\\\\\n    S: +PONG\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s another example of an inline command where the server returns an integer:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: EXISTS somekey\\\\\\\\n    S: :0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically, to issue an inline command, you write space-separated arguments in a telnet session.\\\\\\\\nSince no command starts with `*` (the identifying byte of RESP Arrays), Redis detects this condition and parses your command inline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the Redis protocol is human-readable and easy to implement, its implementation can exhibit performance similar to that of a binary protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP uses prefixed lengths to transfer bulk data.\\\\\\\\nThat makes scanning the payload for special characters unnecessary (unlike parsing JSON, for example).\\\\\\\\nFor the same reason, quoting and escaping the payload isn\\'t needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReading the length of aggregate types (for example, bulk strings or arrays) can be processed with code that performs a single operation per character while at the same time scanning for the CR character.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample (in C):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```c\\\\\\\\n#include <stdio.h>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nint main(void) {\\\\\\\\n    unsigned char *p = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"$123\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n    int len = 0;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    p++;\\\\\\\\n    while(*p != \\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\') {\\\\\\\\n        len = (len*10)+(*p - \\'0\\');\\\\\\\\n        p++;\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    /* Now p points at \\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\', and the length is in len. */\\\\\\\\n    printf(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"%d\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\", len);\\\\\\\\n    return 0;\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the first CR is identified, it can be skipped along with the following LF without further processing.\\\\\\\\nThen, the bulk data can be read with a single read operation that doesn\\'t inspect the payload in any way.\\\\\\\\nFinally, the remaining CR and LF characters are discarded without additional processing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile comparable in performance to a binary protocol, the Redis protocol is significantly more straightforward to implement in most high-level languages, reducing the number of bugs in client software.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* For testing purposes, use [Lua\\'s type conversions]() to have Redis reply with any RESP2/RESP3 needed.\\\\\\\\n  As an example, a RESP3 double can be generated like so:\\\\\\\\n  ```\\\\\\\\n  EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return { double = tonumber(ARGV[1]) }\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 1e0\\\\\\\\n  ```\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.2435,\\\\n

version set for replies with the [`redis.setresp()` function] when it calls `redis.call()` or `redis.pcall()`, the user may opt-in to using RESP3 (with the `HELLO 3` command) for the connection.\\\\\\\\nAlthough the default protocol for incoming client connections is RESP2, the script should honor the user\\'s preference and return adequately-typed RESP3 replies, so the following rules apply on top of those specified in the [Lua to RESP2 type conversion](#lua-to-resp2-type-conversion) section when that is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Lua Boolean -> [RESP3 Boolean reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#boolean-reply) (note that this is a change compared to the RESP2, in which returning a Boolean Lua `true` returned the number 1 to the Redis client, and returning a `false` used to return a `null`.\\\\\\\\n* Lua table with a single _map_ field set to an associative Lua table -> [RESP3 map reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#map-type).\\\\\\\\n* Lua table with a single _set_ field set to an associative Lua table -> [RESP3 set reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#set-type).

reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#double-type).\\\\\\\\n* Lua nil -> [RESP3 null](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#null-reply).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, if the connection is set use the RESP2 protocol, and even if the script replies with RESP3-typed responses, Redis will automatically perform a RESP3 to RESP2 conversion of the reply as is the case for regular commands.\\\\\\\\nThat means, for example, that returning the RESP3 map type to a RESP2 connection will result in the reply being converted to a flat RESP2 array that consists of alternating field names and their values, rather than a RESP3 map.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n

replies:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    -ERR unknown command \\'asdf\\'\\\\\\\\n    -WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first upper-case word after the `-`, up to the first space or newline, represents the kind of error returned.\\\\\\\\nThis word is called an _error prefix_.\\\\\\\\nNote that the error prefix is a convention used by Redis rather than part of the RESP error type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, in Redis, `ERR` is a generic error, whereas `WRONGTYPE` is a more specific error that implies that the client attempted an operation against the wrong data type.\\\\\\\\nThe error prefix allows the client to understand the type of error returned by the server without checking the exact error message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client implementation can return different types of exceptions for various errors, or provide a generic way for trapping errors by directly providing the error name to the caller as a string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, such a feature should not be considered vital as it is rarely useful. \\\\\\\\nAlso, simpler client implementations can return a generic error value, such as

Since 2^14 = 16384, this number represents the maximum addressable space when using 14 bits of the CRC16 hash output.\n\nThe spec also notes that:\n- This effectively sets an upper limit of 16384 master nodes (though the recommended max is ~1000 nodes)\n- In testing, CRC16 behaved remarkably well in distributing different kinds of keys evenly across the 16384 slots\n\n## How Keys Are Mapped\n\nKeys are mapped to hash slots using this algorithm:\n\n```\nHASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\n```\n\n**CRC16 Specification:**\n- Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\n- Width: 16 bit\n- Poly: 1021 (x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\n- Initialization: 0000\n- Output for \"123456789\": 31C3\n\n**Hash Tags Exception:**\nIf a key contains a substring between `{}` brackets, only the content inside the brackets is hashed.

**hash slot**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute the hash\\\\\\\\nslot for a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo\\\\\\\\n16384.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,\\\\\\\\nso, for example, you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.\\\\\\\\n* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.\\\\\\\\n* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes it easy to add and remove cluster nodes. For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.7251,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Hash tags > Hash slot example code\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Commands accepting a glob-style pattern, including [`KEYS`](/commands/keys), [`SCAN`](/commands/scan) and [`SORT`](/commands/sort), are optimized for patterns that imply a single slot.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if all keys that can match a pattern must belong to a specific slot, only this slot is searched for keys matching the pattern.\\\\\\\\nThe pattern slot optimization is introduced in Redis 8.0.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe optimization kicks in when the pattern meets the following conditions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* the pattern contains a hashtag,\\\\\\\\n* there are no wildcards or escape characters before the hashtag, and\\\\\\\\n* the hashtag within curly braces doesn\\'t contain any wildcards or escape characters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, `SCAN 0 MATCH {abc}*` can successfully recognize the hashtag and scans only the slot corresponding to `abc`.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the patterns `*{abc}`, `{a*c}`, or `{a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*bc}` cannot recognize the hashtag, so all slots need to be scanned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding the hash tags exception, the following is an implementation of the `HASH_SLOT` function in Ruby and C language.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRuby example code:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    def HASH_SLOT(key)\\\\\\\\n        s = key.index \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n        if s\\\\\\\\n            e = key.index \\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\\\\\\\\\\\\\",s+1\\\\\\\\n            if e && e != s+1\\\\\\\\n                key = key[s+1..e-1]\\\\\\\\n            end\\\\\\\\n        end\\\\\\\\n        crc16(key) % 16384\\\\\\\\n    end\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nC example code:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    unsigned int HASH_SLOT(char *key, int keylen) {\\\\\\\\n        int s, e; /* start-end indexes of { and } */\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        /* Search the first occurrence of \\'{\\'. */\\\\\\\\n        for (s = 0; s < keylen; s++)\\\\\\\\n            if (key[s] == \\'{\\') break;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        /* No \\'{\\' ?

This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.8861,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > MOVED Redirection\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis client is free to send queries to every node in the cluster, including\\\\\\\\nreplica nodes.

的内存分配器（通常是 jemalloc 或 libc malloc）在释放内存时**不会立即将内存归还给操作系统**。这是大多数内存分配器的通用行为，不是 Redis 特有的问题。\n\n具体表现：\n- 你填充了 5GB 数据，然后删除了 2GB\n- RSS（实际物理内存占用）仍然是 5GB\n- Redis 报告的用户内存只有 3GB\n- 碎片率 = RSS / 实际使用内存 = 5GB / 3GB = 1.67（很高）\n\n原因是：被删除的 key 和仍然存在的 key 通常分配在**同一内存页**上，分配器无法轻易释放这些页面。\n\n## 处理方法\n\n### 1. **主动内存碎片整理（推荐）**\nRedis 4.0+ 支持主动碎片整理功能，配置方式：\n\n```redis\n# 启用主动碎片整理\nCONFIG SET activedefrag yes\n\n# 碎片率达到 100% 时触发（即 RSS / 使用内存 >= 2.0）\nCONFIG SET active-defrag-threshold-lower 100\n\n# 碎片浪费内存达到 100MB 时触发\nCONFIG SET active-defrag-ignore-bytes 104857600\n```\n\n### 2. **重启 Redis 实例**\n最直接的方法：\n- 保存数据（RDB 或 AOF）\n- 重启 Redis\n- 重新加载数据\n\n重启后内存会紧凑排列，碎片率恢复正常。\n\n### 3. **使用 jemalloc 分配器**\n确保 Redis 编译时使用 jemalloc（默认配置）：\n```bash\nredis-server --version  # 查看是否包含 jemalloc\n```\n\njemalloc 比 libc malloc 更能减少碎片问题。\n\n### 4. **预防措施**\n- **按峰值内存规划容量**：如果峰值需要 10GB，即使平时只用 5GB，也要按 10GB 规划\n- **设置 maxmemory**：避免内存无限增长\n  ```redis\n  CONFIG SET maxmemory 8gb  # 为碎片预留 20% 空间\n  ```\n- **监控碎片率**：\n  ```redis\n  INFO memory  # 查看 mem_fragmentation_ratio\n  ```\n\n## 重要提示\n\n⚠️ **碎片率在峰值后不可靠**：如果你的内存使用曾经达到峰值（如 10GB），后来降到 2GB，此时的高碎片率是正常的。分配器会尝试复用这些\"逻辑上已释放\"的内存，当你再次添加数据时，RSS 不会继续增长。\n\n[来源:

as the `maxmemory`\\\\\\\\nsetting enables (however there are small extra allocations possible).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe exact value can be set in the configuration file or set later via\\\\\\\\n[`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) (for more info, see [Using memory as an LRU cache]()).\\\\\\\\nThere are a few things that should be noted about how Redis manages memory:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis will not always free up (return) memory to the OS when keys are removed.\\\\\\\\nThis is not something special about Redis, but it is how most malloc() implementations work.\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you fill an instance with 5GB worth of data, and then\\\\\\\\nremove the equivalent of 2GB of data, the Resident Set Size (also known as\\\\\\\\nthe RSS, which is the number of memory pages consumed by the process)\\\\\\\\nwill probably still be around 5GB, even if Redis will claim that the user\\\\\\\\nmemory is around 3GB.  This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory error for write commands if and when it reaches the \\\\\\\\nlimit - which in turn may result in errors in the application but will not render the \\\\\\\\nwhole machine dead because of memory starvation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.4668,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/arm.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ARM support\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Building Redis in the Pi\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis versions 4.0 and above support the ARM processor in general, and\\\\\\\\nthe Raspberry Pi specifically, as a main platform. Every new release of Redis is tested on the Pi\\\\\\\\nenvironment, and we update this documentation page with information about supported devices and other useful information. While Redis does run on Android, in the future we look forward to extend our testing efforts to Android\\\\\\\\nto also make it an officially supported platform.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe believe that Redis is ideal for IoT and embedded devices for several\\\\\\\\nreasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis has a very small memory footprint and CPU requirements. It can run in small devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero without impacting the overall performance, using a small amount of memory while delivering good performance for many use cases.\\\\\\\\n* The data structures of Redis are often an ideal way to model IoT/embedded use cases. Some examples include accumulating time series data, receiving or queuing commands to execute or respond to send back to the remote servers, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n* Modeling data inside Redis can be very useful in order to make in-device decisions for appliances that must respond very quickly or when the remote servers are offline.\\\\\\\\n* Redis can be used as a communication system between the processes running in the device.\\\\\\\\n* The append-only file storage of Redis is well suited for SSD cards.\\\\\\\\n* The stream data structure included in Redis versions 5.0 and higher was specifically designed for time series applications and has a very low memory overhead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux on ARM allows to trap unaligned accesses and fix them inside the kernel\\\\\\\\nin order to continue the execution of the offending program instead of\\\\\\\\ngenerating a `SIGBUS`. Redis 4.0 and greater are fixed in order to avoid any kind\\\\\\\\nof unaligned access, so there is no need to have a specific value for this\\\\\\\\nkernel configuration. Even when kernel alignment fixing set as disabled Redis should\\\\\\\\nrun as expected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Download Redis version 4.0 or higher.\\\\\\\\n* Use `make` as usual to create the executable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is nothing special in the process. The only difference is that by\\\\\\\\ndefault, Redis uses the `libc` allocator instead of defaulting to `jemalloc`\\\\\\\\nas it does in other Linux based environments. This is because we believe\\\\\\\\nthat for the small use cases inside embedded devices, memory fragmentation\\\\\\\\nis unlikely to be a problem.

Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes.

A partition occurred isolating the old master.\\\\\\\\nSentinels 1 and 2 started a failover promoting Sentinel 1 as the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Sentinel properties guarantee that Sentinel 1 and 2 now have the new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration for the master. However Sentinel 3 has still the old configuration\\\\\\\\nsince it lives in a different partition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe know that Sentinel 3 will get its configuration updated when the network\\\\\\\\npartition will heal, however what happens during the partition if there\\\\\\\\nare clients partitioned with the old master?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients will be still able to write to Redis 3, the old master. When the\\\\\\\\npartition will rejoin, Redis 3 will be turned into a replica of Redis 1, and\\\\\\\\nall the data written during the partition will be lost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDepending on your configuration you may want or not that this scenario happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a cache, it could be handy that Client B is still able to write to the old master, even if its data will be lost.\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a store, this is not good and you need to configure the system in order to partially prevent this problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis is asynchronously replicated, there is no way to totally prevent data loss in this scenario, however you can bound the divergence between Redis 3 and Redis 1\\\\\\\\nusing the following Redis configuration option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration the Redis 3 in the above example will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel 3 configuration will converge to\\\\\\\\nthe new one, and Client B will be able to fetch a valid configuration and continue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general Redis + Sentinel as a whole are an **eventually consistent system** where the merge function is **last failover wins**, and the data from old masters are discarded to replicate the data of the current master, so there is always a window for losing acknowledged writes. This is due to Redis asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication and the discarding nature of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merge function of the system. Note that this is not a limitation of Sentinel itself, and if you orchestrate the failover with a strongly consistent replicated state machine, the same properties will still apply. There are only two ways to avoid losing acknowledged writes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Use synchronous replication (and a proper consensus algorithm to run a replicated state machine).\\\\\\\\n2. Use an eventually consistent system where different versions of the same object can be merged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis currently is not able to use any of the above systems, and is currently outside the development goals. However there are proxies implementing solution \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on top of Redis stores such as SoundCloud [Roshi](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi), or Netflix [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel persistent state\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel state is persisted in the sentinel configuration file. For example\\\\\\\\nevery time a new configuration is received, or created (leader Sentinels), for\\\\\\\\na master, the configuration is persisted on disk together with the configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch.

Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties.

This data will be lost forever since when the partition\\\\\\\\nwill heal, the master will be reconfigured as a replica of the new master,\\\\\\\\ndiscarding its data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis problem can be mitigated using the following Redis replication\\\\\\\\nfeature, that allows to stop accepting writes if a master detects that\\\\\\\\nit is no longer able to transfer its writes to the specified number of replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration, the old Redis master M1 in the above example, will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel configuration will converge to the new one, the client C1 will be able to fetch a valid configuration and will continue with the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever there is no free lunch. With this refinement, if the two replicas are\\\\\\\\ndown, the master will stop accepting writes.

Redis Functions and Lua scripts:\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### **Redis Functions** (introduced in Redis 7.0)\n- **First-class database artifacts**: Functions are managed as an integral part of the database\n- **Persistent**: Stored alongside data, persisted to AOF, and replicated from master to replicas\n- **Named and versioned**: Each function has a unique user-defined name, making it easier to call and trace\n- **Declared before use**: Applications don't need to load them during runtime\n- **Library-based**: Functions belong to libraries, enabling code sharing between functions\n- **Immutable libraries**: Libraries are updated as a whole, not selectively\n- **No debugger support**: The Lua debugger is not available for functions\n\n### **Lua Scripts** (EVAL/EVALSHA)\n- **Ephemeral**: Considered part of the client application, not the database\n- **Not persistent**: Script cache can be lost after server restart, failover, or SCRIPT FLUSH\n- **Anonymous**: Identified only by SHA1 digest, making debugging harder\n- **Sent on every execution**: EVAL sends the entire script each time (though EVALSHA optimizes this)\n- **Application responsibility**: Apps must reload scripts if missing\n- **No code sharing**: Scripts can't call other scripts\n- **Debugger available**: Full Lua debugger (LDB) support\n\n## When to Use Which?\n\n### **Use Redis Functions when:**\n- You need **persistent, reusable logic** that survives restarts and failovers\n- Building a **logical schema** or consistent data entity views\n- Want to **extend Redis with custom APIs** similar to modules\n- Need **code sharing** between multiple functions in a library\n- Prefer **named functions** for easier debugging and tracing\n- Using Redis as a primary database (not just cache)\n\n### **Use Lua Scripts when:**\n- Implementing **lightweight, application-specific logic**\n- Logic is **tightly coupled to application code** and changes frequently\n- Need the **Lua debugger** for development\n- Using Redis as an **ephemeral cache** where persistence isn't critical\n- Simple one-off operations that don't require code reuse\n\n## Common Ground\n\nBoth approaches share:\n- **Atomic execution**: Block all server activities during execution\n- **Same Lua 5.1 engine** and capabilities\n- **Access to all Redis commands** via `redis.call()` and `redis.pcall()`\n- **Script effects replication** (default since Redis 5.0/7.0)\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md > \"What are Redis Functions?\" + \"Prologue (or,

Redis commands from a Lua script either via [`redis.call()`]() or [`redis.pcall()`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two are nearly identical.\\\\\\\\nBoth execute a Redis command along with its provided arguments, if these represent a well-formed command.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as

evolutionary step from ephemeral scripting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions provide the same core functionality as scripts but are first-class software artifacts of the database.\\\\\\\\nRedis manages functions as an integral part of the database and ensures their availability via data persistence and replication.\\\\\\\\nBecause functions are part of the database and therefore declared before use, applications aren\\'t required to load them during runtime nor risk aborted transactions.\\\\\\\\nAn application that uses functions depends only on their APIs rather than on the embedded script logic in the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhereas ephemeral scripts are considered a part of the application\\'s domain, functions extend the database server itself with user-provided logic.\\\\\\\\nThey can be used to expose a richer API composed of core Redis commands, similar to modules, developed once, loaded at startup, and used repeatedly by various applications / clients.\\\\\\\\nEvery function has a unique user-defined name, making it much easier to call and trace its execution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe design of Redis Functions also attempts to demarcate between the programming language used for writing functions and their management by the server.\\\\\\\\nLua, the only language interpreter that Redis presently support as an embedded execution engine, is meant to be simple and easy to learn.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the choice of Lua as a language still presents many Redis users with a challenge.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Functions feature makes no assumptions about the implementation\\'s language.\\\\\\\\nAn execution engine that is part of the definition of the function handles running it.\\\\\\\\nAn engine can theoretically execute functions in any language as long as it respects several rules (such as the ability to terminate an executing function).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPresently, as noted above, Redis ships with a single embedded [Lua 5.1]() engine.\\\\\\\\nThere are plans to support additional engines in the future.\\\\\\\\nRedis functions can use all of Lua\\'s available capabilities to ephemeral scripts,\\\\\\\\nwith the only exception being the [Redis Lua scripts debugger]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions also simplify development by enabling code sharing.\\\\\\\\nEvery function belongs to a single library, and any given library can consist of multiple functions.\\\\\\\\nThe library\\'s contents are immutable, and selective updates of its functions aren\\'t allowed.\\\\\\\\nInstead, libraries are updated as a whole with all of their functions together in one operation.\\\\\\\\nThis allows calling functions from other functions within the same library, or sharing code between functions by using a common code in library-internal methods, that can also take language native arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions are intended to better support the use case of maintaining a consistent view for data entities through a logical schema, as mentioned above.\\\\\\\\nAs such, functions are stored alongside the data itself.\\\\\\\\nFunctions are also persisted to the AOF file and replicated from master to replicas, so they are as durable as the data itself.\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis is used as an ephemeral cache, additional mechanisms (described below) are required to make functions more durable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLike all other operations in Redis, the execution of a function is atomic.\\\\\\\\nA function\\'s execution blocks all server activities during its entire time, similarly to the semantics of [transactions]().\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\nThe blocking semantics of an executed function apply to all connected clients at all times.\\\\\\\\nBecause running a function blocks the Redis server, functions are meant to finish executing quickly, so you should avoid using long-running functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n

employ programmatic control structures and use most of the [commands]() while executing to access the database.\\\\\\\\nBecause scripts execute in the server, reading and writing data from scripts is very efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis guarantees the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\nWhile executing the script, all server activities are blocked during its entire runtime.\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripting offers several properties that can be valuable in many cases.\\\\\\\\nThese include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Providing locality by executing logic where data lives. Data locality reduces overall latency and saves networking resources.\\\\\\\\n* Blocking semantics that ensure the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\n* Enabling the composition of simple capabilities that are either missing from Redis or are too niche to be a part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLua lets you run part of your application logic inside Redis.\\\\\\\\nSuch scripts can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine.\\\\\\\\nPresently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference]() page for complete documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough the server executes them, Eval scripts are regarded as a part of the client-side application, which is why they\\'re not named, versioned, or persisted.\\\\\\\\nSo all scripts may need to be reloaded by the application at any time if missing (after a server restart, fail-over to a replica, etc.).\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, [Redis Functions]() offer an alternative approach to programmability which allow the server itself to be extended with additional programmed logic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll start scripting with Redis by using the [`EVAL`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s our first example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello, scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, [`EVAL`]() takes two arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe first argument is a string that consists of the script\\'s Lua source code.\\\\\\\\nThe script doesn\\'t need to include any definitions of Lua function.\\\\\\\\nIt is just a Lua program that will run in the Redis engine\\'s context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second argument is the number of arguments that follow the script\\'s body, starting from the third argument, representing Redis key names.\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we used the value _0_ because we didn\\'t provide the script with any arguments, whether the names of keys or not.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.4927,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with Redis 3.2, it is possible to select an alternative replication method.\\\\\\\\nInstead of replicating whole scripts, we can replicate the write commands generated by the script.\\\\\\\\nWe call this **script effects replication**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:**\\\\\\\\nstarting with Redis 5.0, script effects replication is the default mode and does not need to be explicitly enabled.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this replication mode, while Lua scripts are executed, Redis collects all the commands executed by the Lua scripting engine that actually modify the dataset.\\\\\\\\nWhen the script execution finishes, the sequence of commands that the script generated are wrapped into a [`MULTI`]()/[`EXEC`]() [transaction]() and are sent to the replicas and AOF.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is useful in several ways depending on the use case:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When the script is slow to compute, but the effects can be summarized by a few write commands, it is a shame to re-compute the script on the replicas or when reloading the AOF.\\\\\\\\n  In this case, it is much better to replicate just the effects of the script.\\\\\\\\n* When script effects replication is enabled, the restrictions on non-deterministic functions are removed.\\\\\\\\n  You can, for example, use the [`TIME`]() or [`SRANDMEMBER`]() commands inside your scripts freely at any place.\\\\\\\\n* The Lua PRNG in this mode is seeded randomly on every call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnless already enabled by the server\\'s configuration or defaults (before Redis 7.0), you need to issue the following Lua command before the script performs a write:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.replicate_commands()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`redis.replicate_commands()`]() function returns _true) if script effects replication was enabled;\\\\\\\\notherwise, if the function was called after the script already called a write command,\\\\\\\\nit returns _false_, and normal whole script replication is used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis function is deprecated as of Redis 7.0, and while you can still call it, it will always succeed.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\":

By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes to already-established and well-liked ephemeral scripts, Redis v7.0 introduces Redis Functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.9564,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

\\\\\\\\nHowever other clients can be developed by following the simple protocol implemented by the server.\\\\\\\\n* By default every new debugging session is a forked session.\\\\\\\\nIt means that while the Redis Lua script is being debugged, the server does not block and is usable for development or in order to execute multiple debugging sessions in parallel.\\\\\\\\nThis also means that changes are **rolled back** after the script debugging session finished, so that\\'s possible to restart a new debugging session again, using exactly the same Redis data set as the previous debugging session.\\\\\\\\n* An alternative synchronous (non forked) debugging model is available on demand, so that changes to the dataset can be retained.\\\\\\\\nIn this mode the server blocks for the time the debugging session is active.\\\\\\\\n* Support for step by step execution.\\\\\\\\n* Support for static and dynamic breakpoints.\\\\\\\\n* Support from logging the debugged script into the debugger console.\\\\\\\\n* Inspection of Lua variables.\\\\\\\\n* Tracing of Redis commands executed by the script.\\\\\\\\n* Pretty printing of Redis and Lua values.\\\\\\\\n* Infinite loops and long execution detection, which simulates a breakpoint.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.3362,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

a given Redis command and returns its reply.\\\\\\\\nIts inputs are the command and arguments, and once called, it executes the command in Redis and returns the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, we can call the [`ECHO`]() command from a script and return its reply like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nreturn redis.call(\\'ECHO\\', \\'Echo, echo... eco...

exception is thrown by the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following demonstrates how to use `redis.pcall()` to intercept and handle runtime exceptions from within the context of an ephemeral

how to benchmark Redis performance:\n\n## Primary Tool: redis-benchmark\n\nRedis includes a built-in utility called **`redis-benchmark`** that simulates running commands by N clients sending M total queries (similar to Apache's `ab` utility).\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -q -n 100000\n```\n\n### Key Options\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark [-h <host>] [-p <port>] [-c <clients>] [-n <requests>] [-k <boolean>]\n\n-h <hostname>      Server hostname (default 127.0.0.1)\n-p <port>          Server port (default 6379)\n-c <clients>       Number of parallel connections (default 50)\n-n <requests>      Total number of requests (default 100000)\n-d <size>          Data size of SET/GET value in bytes (default 3)\n-P <numreq>        Pipeline requests (default 1, no pipeline)\n-t <tests>         Only run specific tests (comma-separated)\n-q                 Quiet mode - just show query/sec values\n--threads <num>    Enable multi-thread mode\n--cluster          Enable cluster mode\n```\n\n### Common Scenarios\n\n**Test specific commands:**\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -t set,lpush -n 100000 -q\n```\n\n**Use pipelining for higher throughput:**\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\n```\n\n**Random key space (more realistic):**\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -t set -r 100000 -n 1000000\n```\n\n## Alternative Third-Party Tools\n\n1. **[memtier_benchmark](https://github.com/redislabs/memtier_benchmark)** - NoSQL Redis and Memcache traffic generation tool from Redis Labs\n2. **[rpc-perf](https://github.com/twitter/rpc-perf)** - RPC benchmarking tool from Twitter (supports Redis and Memcache)\n3. **[YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB)** - Yahoo's benchmarking framework with clients for many databases including Redis\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n- Use pipelining (`-P` option) to achieve realistic throughput\n- Test with random keys (`-r` option) to simulate cache misses\n- Run tests on the loopback interface or use multiple connections\n- Consider network bandwidth, CPU, and RAM as performance factors\n- For production-like results, enable AOF if you use persistence\n\n[Source:

In Redis the difference\\\\\\\\nbetween such a synthetic benchmark and a real one is not huge since it is an\\\\\\\\nin-memory system, however it is possible to stress cache misses and in general\\\\\\\\nto simulate a more real-world work load by using a large key space.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is obtained by using the `-r` switch. For instance if I want to run\\\\\\\\none million SET operations, using a random key for every operation out of\\\\\\\\n100k possible keys, I\\'ll use the following command line:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli flushall\\\\\\\\n    OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -t set -r 100000 -n 1000000\\\\\\\\n    ====== SET ======\\\\\\\\n      1000000 requests completed in 13.86 seconds\\\\\\\\n      50 parallel clients\\\\\\\\n      3 bytes payload\\\\\\\\n      keep alive: 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    99.76% `<=` 1 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    99.98% `<=` 2 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    72144.87 requests per second\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli dbsize\\\\\\\\n    (integer) 99993\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default every client (the benchmark simulates 50 clients if not otherwise\\\\\\\\nspecified with `-c`) sends the next command only when the reply of the previous\\\\\\\\ncommand is received, this means that the server will likely need a read call\\\\\\\\nin order to read each command from every client. Also RTT is paid as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis supports [pipelining](/topics/pipelining), so it is possible to send\\\\\\\\nmultiple commands at once, a feature often exploited by real world applications.\\\\\\\\nRedis pipelining is able to dramatically improve the number of operations per\\\\\\\\nsecond a server is able to deliver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of running the benchmark in a MacBook Air 11\\\\\\\\\\\\\" using a\\\\\\\\npipelining of 16 commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\\\\\\\\n    SET: 1536098.25 requests per second, p50=0.479 msec                     \\\\\\\\n    GET: 1811594.25 requests per second, p50=0.391 msec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining results in a significant increase in performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPitfalls and misconceptions\\\\\\\\n---------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first point is obvious: the golden rule of a useful benchmark is to\\\\\\\\nonly compare apples and apples. Different versions of Redis can be compared\\\\\\\\non the same workload for instance. Or the same version of Redis, but with\\\\\\\\ndifferent options. If you plan to compare Redis to something else, then it is\\\\\\\\nimportant to evaluate the functional and technical differences, and take them\\\\\\\\nin account.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is a server, hence, all commands involve network round trips. Embedded data stores do not involve network and protocol management. When comparing such products to Redis, command execution times should be used instead of end-to-end times.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis commands return an acknowledgment for all usual commands. Some other data stores do not. Comparing Redis to stores involving one-way queries is only mildly useful.\\\\\\\\n+ Naively iterating on synchronous Redis commands does not benchmark Redis itself, but rather measure your network (or IPC) latency and the client library intrinsic latency. To really test Redis, you need multiple connections (like redis-benchmark) and/or to use pipelining to aggregate several commands and/or multiple threads or processes.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is an in-memory data store with some optional persistence options. If you plan to compare it to transactional servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc ...), then you should consider activating AOF and decide on a suitable fsync policy.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is, mostly, a single-threaded server from the POV of commands execution (actually modern versions of Redis use threads for different things). It is not designed to benefit from multiple CPU cores. People are supposed to launch several Redis instances to scale out on several cores if needed. It is not really fair to compare one single Redis instance to a multi-threaded data store.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA common misconception is that redis-benchmark is designed to make Redis\\\\\\\\nperformances look stellar, the throughput achieved by redis-benchmark being\\\\\\\\nsomewhat artificial, and not achievable by a real application. This is\\\\\\\\nactually not true.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `redis-benchmark` program is a quick and useful way to get some figures and\\\\\\\\nevaluate the performance of a Redis instance on a given hardware. However,\\\\\\\\nby default, it does not represent the maximum throughput a Redis instance can\\\\\\\\nsustain. Actually, by using pipelining and a fast client (hiredis), it is fairly\\\\\\\\neasy to write a program generating more throughput than redis-benchmark. The\\\\\\\\ndefault behavior of redis-benchmark is to achieve throughput by exploiting\\\\\\\\nconcurrency only (i.e. it creates several connections to the server).\\\\\\\\nIt does not use pipelining or any parallelism at all (one pending query per\\\\\\\\nconnection at most, and no multi-threading), if not explicitly enabled via\\\\\\\\nthe `-P` parameter. So in some way using `redis-benchmark` and, triggering, for\\\\\\\\nexample, a `BGSAVE` operation in the background at the same time, will provide\\\\\\\\nthe user with numbers more near to the *worst case* than to the best case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo run a benchmark using pipelining mode (and achieve higher throughput),\\\\\\\\nyou need to explicitly use the -P option. Please note that it is still a\\\\\\\\nrealistic behavior since a lot of Redis based applications actively use\\\\\\\\npipelining to improve performance. However you should use a pipeline size that\\\\\\\\nis more or less the average pipeline length you\\'ll be able to use in your\\\\\\\\napplication in order to get realistic numbers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, the benchmark should apply the same operations, and work in the same way\\\\\\\\nwith the multiple data stores you want to compare. It is absolutely pointless to\\\\\\\\ncompare the result of redis-benchmark to the result of another benchmark\\\\\\\\nprogram and extrapolate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, Redis and memcached in single-threaded mode can be compared on\\\\\\\\nGET/SET operations. Both are in-memory data stores, working mostly in the same\\\\\\\\nway at the protocol level. Provided their respective benchmark application is\\\\\\\\naggregating queries in the same way (pipelining) and use a similar number of\\\\\\\\nconnections, the comparison is actually meaningful.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis perfect example is illustrated by the dialog between Redis (antirez) and\\\\\\\\nmemcached (dormando) developers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 1 - On Redis, Memcached, Speed, Benchmarks and The Toilet](http://antirez.com/post/redis-memcached-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[dormando - Redis VS Memcached (slightly better bench)](http://dormando.livejournal.com/525147.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 2 - An update on the Memcached/Redis benchmark](http://antirez.com/post/update-on-memcached-redis-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can see that in the end, the difference between the two solutions is not\\\\\\\\nso staggering, once all technical aspects are considered. Please note both\\\\\\\\nRedis and memcached have been optimized further after these benchmarks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, when very efficient servers are benchmarked (and stores like Redis\\\\\\\\nor memcached definitely fall in this category), it may be difficult to saturate\\\\\\\\nthe server. Sometimes, the performance bottleneck is on client side,\\\\\\\\nand not server-side. In that case, the client (i.e. the benchmark program itself)\\\\\\\\nmust be fixed, or perhaps scaled out, in order to reach the maximum throughput.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFactors impacting Redis performance\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are multiple factors having direct consequences on Redis performance.\\\\\\\\nWe mention them here, since they can alter the result of any benchmarks.\\\\\\\\nPlease note however, that a typical Redis instance running on a low end,\\\\\\\\nuntuned box usually provides good enough performance for most applications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Network bandwidth and latency usually have a direct impact on the performance.\\\\\\\\nIt is a good practice to use the ping program to quickly check the latency\\\\\\\\nbetween the client and server hosts is normal before launching the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nRegarding the bandwidth, it is generally useful to estimate\\\\\\\\nthe throughput in Gbit/s and compare it to the theoretical bandwidth\\\\\\\\nof the network. For instance a benchmark setting 4 KB strings\\\\\\\\nin Redis at 100000 q/s, would actually consume 3.2 Gbit/s of bandwidth\\\\\\\\nand probably fit within a 10 Gbit/s link, but not a 1 Gbit/s one. In many real\\\\\\\\nworld scenarios, Redis throughput is limited by the network well before being\\\\\\\\nlimited by the CPU. To consolidate several high-throughput Redis instances\\\\\\\\non a single server, it worth considering putting a 10 Gbit/s NIC\\\\\\\\nor multiple 1 Gbit/s NICs with TCP/IP bonding.\\\\\\\\n+ CPU is another very important factor. Being single-threaded, Redis favors\\\\\\\\nfast CPUs with large caches and not many cores. At this game, Intel CPUs are\\\\\\\\ncurrently the winners. It is not uncommon to get only half the performance on\\\\\\\\nan AMD Opteron CPU compared to similar Nehalem EP/Westmere EP/Sandy Bridge\\\\\\\\nIntel CPUs with Redis. When client and server run on the same box, the CPU is\\\\\\\\nthe limiting factor with redis-benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ Speed of RAM and memory bandwidth seem less critical for global performance\\\\\\\\nespecially for small objects. For large objects (>10 KB), it may become\\\\\\\\nnoticeable though. Usually, it is not really cost-effective to buy expensive\\\\\\\\nfast memory modules to optimize Redis.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis runs slower on a VM compared to running without virtualization using\\\\\\\\nthe same hardware. If you have the chance to run Redis on a physical machine\\\\\\\\nthis is preferred. However this does not mean that Redis is slow in\\\\\\\\nvirtualized environments, the delivered performances are still very good\\\\\\\\nand most of the serious performance issues you may incur in virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironments are due to over-provisioning, non-local disks with high latency,\\\\\\\\nor old hypervisor software that have slow `fork` syscall implementation.\\\\\\\\n+ When the server and client benchmark programs run on the same box, both\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback and unix domain sockets can be used. Depending on the\\\\\\\\nplatform, unix domain sockets can achieve around 50% more throughput than\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback (on Linux for instance). The default behavior of\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark is to use the TCP/IP loopback.\\\\\\\\n+ The performance benefit of unix domain sockets compared to TCP/IP loopback\\\\\\\\ntends to decrease when pipelining is heavily used (i.e. long pipelines).\\\\\\\\n+ When an ethernet network is used to access Redis, aggregating commands using\\\\\\\\npipelining is especially efficient when the size of the data is kept under\\\\\\\\nthe ethernet packet size (about 1500 bytes). Actually, processing 10 bytes,\\\\\\\\n100 bytes, or 1000 bytes queries almost result in the same throughput.\\\\\\\\nSee the graph below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Data size impact](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/client_command/topics/Data_size.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ On multi CPU sockets servers, Redis performance becomes dependent on the\\\\\\\\nNUMA configuration and process location. The most visible effect is that\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark results seem non-deterministic because client and server\\\\\\\\nprocesses are distributed randomly on the cores. To get deterministic results,\\\\\\\\nit is required to use process placement tools (on Linux: taskset or numactl).\\\\\\\\nThe most efficient combination is always to put the client and server on two\\\\\\\\ndifferent cores of the same CPU to benefit from the L3 cache.\\\\\\\\nHere are some results of 4 KB SET benchmark for 3 server CPUs (AMD Istanbul,\\\\\\\\nIntel Nehalem EX, and Intel Westmere) with different relative placements.\\\\\\\\nPlease note this benchmark is not meant to compare CPU models between themselves\\\\\\\\n(CPUs exact model and frequency are therefore not disclosed).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![NUMA chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/6374a07f93e867353e5e946c1e39a573dfc83f6c/topics/NUMA_chart.gif)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, the number of client connections is also an\\\\\\\\nimportant factor. Being based on epoll/kqueue, the Redis event loop is quite\\\\\\\\nscalable. Redis has already been benchmarked at more than 60000 connections,\\\\\\\\nand was still able to sustain 50000 q/s in these conditions. As a rule of thumb,\\\\\\\\nan instance with 30000 connections can only process half the throughput\\\\\\\\nachievable with 100 connections. Here is an example showing the throughput of\\\\\\\\na Redis instance per number of connections:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![connections chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/system_info/topics/Connections_chart.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, it is possible to achieve higher throughput by\\\\\\\\ntuning the NIC(s) configuration and associated interruptions. Best throughput\\\\\\\\nis achieved by setting an affinity between Rx/Tx NIC queues and CPU cores,\\\\\\\\nand activating RPS (Receive Packet Steering) support. More information in this\\\\\\\\n[thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/gUhc19gnYgc/BruTPCOroiMJ).\\\\\\\\nJumbo frames may also provide a performance boost when large objects are used.\\\\\\\\n+ Depending on the platform, Redis can be compiled against different memory\\\\\\\\nallocators (libc malloc, jemalloc, tcmalloc), which may have different behaviors\\\\\\\\nin term of raw speed, internal and external fragmentation.\\\\\\\\nIf you did not compile Redis yourself, you can use the INFO command to check\\\\\\\\nthe `mem_allocator` field. Please note most benchmarks do not run long enough to\\\\\\\\ngenerate significant external fragmentation (contrary to production Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOther things to consider\\\\\\\\n------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne important goal of any benchmark is to get reproducible results, so they\\\\\\\\ncan be compared to the results of other tests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ A good practice is to try to run tests on isolated hardware as much as possible.\\\\\\\\nIf it is not possible, then the system must be monitored to check the benchmark\\\\\\\\nis not impacted by some external activity.\\\\\\\\n+ Some configurations (desktops and laptops for sure, some servers as well)\\\\\\\\nhave a variable CPU core frequency mechanism. The policy controlling this\\\\\\\\nmechanism can be set at the OS level. Some CPU models are more aggressive than\\\\\\\\nothers at adapting the frequency of the CPU cores to the workload. To get\\\\\\\\nreproducible results, it is better to set the highest possible fixed frequency\\\\\\\\nfor all the CPU cores involved in the benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ An important point is to size the system accordingly to the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nThe system must have enough RAM and must not swap. On Linux, do not forget\\\\\\\\nto set the `overcommit_memory` parameter correctly. Please note 32 and 64 bit\\\\\\\\nRedis instances do not have the same memory footprint.\\\\\\\\n+ If you plan to use RDB or AOF for your benchmark, please check there is no other\\\\\\\\nI/O activity in the system. Avoid putting RDB or AOF files on NAS or NFS shares,\\\\\\\\nor on any other devices impacting your network bandwidth and/or latency\\\\\\\\n(for instance, EBS on Amazon EC2).\\\\\\\\n+ Set Redis logging level (loglevel parameter) to warning or notice. Avoid putting\\\\\\\\nthe generated log file on a remote filesystem.\\\\\\\\n+ Avoid using monitoring tools which can alter the result of the benchmark. For\\\\\\\\ninstance using INFO at regular interval to gather statistics is probably fine,\\\\\\\\nbut MONITOR will impact the measured performance significantly.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5715,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/arm.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ARM support\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance testing of Redis was performed on the Raspberry Pi 3 and Pi 1 model B.

2000) ** 2 < 100 and .rating / 2 > 4'\n```\n\n## 性能调优\n\n使用 `FILTER-EF` 参数控制引擎检查多少候选节点来找到足够的过滤结果（默认 `COUNT * 100`）：\n\n```bash\nVSIM vset VALUES 3 0 0 0 COUNT 10 FILTER '.year > 2000' FILTER-EF 500\n```\n\n- 对于稀有过滤条件，使用更高的值\n- 使用 `FILTER-EF 0` 扫描所有需要的节点\n- 引擎会在找到足够高质量结果时提前停止\n\n## 支持的数据类型\n\n- 数字\n- 字符串\n- 布尔值（转换为 1 或 0）\n- 数组（用于 `in` 运算符）\n\n如果字段缺失或无效，该元素会被跳过，不会报错。\n\n---\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/filtered-search.md]**", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/vector-database.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["vector", "filter", "search"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/vector-database.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "a51fdbb3-04ba-406d-892b-81c290e5cd68", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "576e685a-3cda-4417-af5a-c4a328e418c4", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来帮你检索 Redis vector sets 的 filtered search 相关信息。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_30oBUikY73iWykjWeyWB2z', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis vector sets filtered search tag filter', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_BzERNo8ZOsuTLnY4CfD1Fr', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'filtered search|tag filter|vector search filter'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_30oBUikY73iWykjWeyWB2z', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.2669,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"49a1af21\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"49a1af21-009\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisos 8.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Open Source 8.0.1 (May 2025) > Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- [#13959](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/13959) Vector sets -

The following code creates a Python NumPy array from the query vector and converts it into a compact, byte-level representation that can be passed as a parameter to the query:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nfor i, encoded_query in enumerate(encoded_queries):\\\\\\\\n    result = client.ft(\\'idx:bikes_vss\\').search(\\\\\\\\n        query,\\\\\\\\n        {\\\\\\\\n          \\'query_vector\\': np.array(encoded_query, dtype=np.float32).tobytes()\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n    )\\\\\\\\n    print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Results for query \\'{queries[i]}\\':\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n    for doc in result.docs:\\\\\\\\n        print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t{doc.id}: {doc.brand} {doc.model}\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the template for the query in place, you can execute all queries in a loop. Notice that the script calculates the `vector_score` for each result as `1 - doc.vector_score`. Because the cosine distance is used as the metric, the items with the smallest distance are closer and, therefore, more similar to the query.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, loop over the matched documents and create a list of results that can be converted into a Pandas table to visualize the results:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe query results show the individual queries\\' top three matches (our K parameter) along with the bike\\'s id, brand, and model for each query.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, for the query \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Best Mountain bikes for kids\\\\\\\\\\\\\", the highest similarity score (`0.54`) and, therefore the closest match was the \\'Nord\\' brand \\'Chook air 5\\' bike model, described as:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> The Chook Air 5 gives kids aged six years and older a durable and uberlight mountain bike for their first experience on tracks and easy cruising through forests and fields. The lower top tube makes it easy to mount and dismount in any situation, giving your kids greater safety on the trails.

This update also includes highly-requested support for indexing empty and missing values and enhances the developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities. Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax easier.

Here's how to do it:\n\n## Building a Local RAG Agent with Llama 3.2\n\n### Overview\nYou can build a fully local RAG system using Llama 3.2 via Ollama, with Qdrant as the vector database, using the Agno v2.0 framework.\n\n### Key Features\n- Fully local implementation (no external API dependencies)\n- Powered by Llama 3.2 through Ollama\n- Vector search using Qdrant\n- Interactive AgentOS interface\n- Uses Agno v2.0 Knowledge class for document management\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n**1. Clone the repository**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent\n```\n\n**2. Install dependencies**\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**3. Set up Qdrant vector database**\n```bash\ndocker pull qdrant/qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\n**4. Install Ollama and pull required models**\n```bash\nollama pull llama3.2\nollama pull openhermes  # For embeddings\n```\n\n**5. Run the RAG agent**\n```bash\npython local_rag_agent.py\n```\n\n**6. Access the interface**\nOpen your browser to `http://localhost:7777` to interact with the RAG agent through the AgentOS interface.\n\n### Important Notes\n- The knowledge base loads a Thai Recipes PDF on the first run\n- After the first run, you can comment out the `knowledge_base.add_content()` line to avoid reloading\n- The AgentOS interface provides a web-based UI for interaction\n\n### Complete Tutorial\nFor detailed code walkthroughs, explanations, and best practices, follow the [complete step-by-step tutorial](https://www.theunwindai.com/p/build-a-local-rag-agent).\n\n[来源:

167.67045164108276, "cost_usd": 0.070663, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 4090, "answer": "Based on the knowledge base search, here's how to build a RAG app that can chat with PDF documents:\n\n## Quick Start: 30-Line Python Implementation\n\nThe simplest approach uses **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** with just 30 lines of Python code:\n\n**Core Steps:**\n1. **Upload PDF** - Allow users to upload PDF documents\n2. **Process & Chunk** - Split PDF content into manageable chunks\n3. **Create Embeddings** - Convert text chunks to vector embeddings\n4. **Store in Vector DB** - Index embeddings for similarity search\n5. **Query & Retrieve** - Find relevant chunks based on user questions\n6. **Generate Answers** - Use LLM to synthesize responses from retrieved context\n\n## Implementation Options\n\n### Option 1: Basic RAG with OpenAI (Recommended for Beginners)\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_pdf\npip install -r requirements.txt\nstreamlit run chat_pdf.py\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Simple Streamlit interface\n- OpenAI embeddings + GPT for generation\n- Basic RAG pipeline\n- ~30 lines of code\n\n### Option 2: Hybrid Search RAG (Better Accuracy)\nUses combination of semantic search + keyword matching with reranking:\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- Claude 3 Opus for generation\n- OpenAI text-embedding-3-large for embeddings\n- Cohere 3.5 for reranking\n- PostgreSQL (Neon) or SQLite for storage\n- RAGLite for document processing\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\ncd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/hybrid_search_rag\npip install -r requirements.txt\nstreamlit run main.py\n```\n\n### Option 3: Local RAG (Privacy-Focused)\nRuns entirely on your machine without external API calls:\n\n**Features:**\n- Local LLM (GGUF format, Q4_K_M quantization)\n- BGE-M3 embedder (1024 dimensions)\n- 4096 token context window\n- Metal/CUDA acceleration support\n\n```bash\ncd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_hybrid_search_rag\nstreamlit run local_main.py\n```\n\n### Option 4: Voice-Enabled RAG\nAdds text-to-speech for audio responses:\n\n**Additional Features:**\n- OpenAI TTS with multiple voice options\n- Audio playback and download\n- Qdrant vector database\n- Real-time audio streaming\n\n```bash\ncd awesome-llm-apps/voice_ai_agents/voice_rag_openaisdk\nstreamlit run rag_voice.py\n```\n\n### Option 5: Autonomous RAG (Advanced)\nSelf-improving system with web search fallback:\n\n**Features:**\n- GPT-4o with autonomous decision-making\n- PgVector database\n- DuckDuckGo web search integration\n- Persistent conversation storage\n\n```bash\ncd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/autonomous_rag\n# Start PgVector database first\ndocker run -d -e POSTGRES_DB=ai -e POSTGRES_USER=ai \\\n  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ai -p 5532:5432 \\\n  --name pgvector phidata/pgvector:16\nstreamlit run autorag.py\n```\n\n## Key Components Explained\n\n**Document Processing:**\n- Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for intelligent chunking\n- Maintain context overlap between chunks\n- Extract and preserve document metadata\n\n**Vector Storage:**\n- Qdrant Cloud (managed, scalable)\n- PgVector (PostgreSQL extension)\n- SQLite (local development)\n\n**Retrieval Strategy:**\n- Semantic search for concept matching\n- Keyword search for exact terms\n- Hybrid approach combines both\n- Reranking improves result quality\n\n**Response Generation:**\n- Provide retrieved context to LLM\n- Include source attribution\n- Fallback to general knowledge when needed\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Chunk size:** 500-1000 characters with 100-200 overlap\n- **Top-k retrieval:** Start with 3-5 most relevant chunks\n- **Embeddings:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-large or BGE-M3 for local\n- **Reranking:** Use Cohere for production quality\n- **Context window:** Ensure LLM can handle retrieved chunks + prompt\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_pdf/README.md > 📄 Chat with PDF > Interactive Application Demo]\n\n[来源:

It enables you to ask questions about images, diagrams, charts, and PDF pages using natural language.\n\n### How Vision RAG Works\n\n**Two-Stage Process:**\n\n1. **Retrieval Stage:**\n   - Images (or PDF pages) are converted to base64 strings\n   - A multimodal embedding model (like Cohere Embed-4) generates vector embeddings for each image\n   - When you ask a text question, it's embedded using the same model\n   - Cosine similarity finds the most relevant image for your query\n\n2. **Generation Stage:**\n   - The retrieved image + your text question are sent to a vision-capable LLM (like Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)\n   - The model analyzes the image content and generates a contextual answer\n\n### Key Capabilities\n\n- **Multimodal Search**: Find relevant images based on text queries using semantic similarity\n- **Visual Question Answering**: Get answers about chart data, diagrams, infographics without OCR\n- **PDF Support**: Automatically extracts PDF pages as images for

the content of the retrieved image/page and generate accurate, context-aware answers.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexible Content Sources**: \\\\\\\\n    - Use pre-loaded sample financial charts and infographics.\\\\\\\\n    - Upload your own custom images (PNG, JPG, JPEG).\\\\\\\\n    - **Upload PDF documents**: Automatically extracts pages as images for analysis.\\\\\\\\n- **No OCR Required**: Directly processes complex images and visual elements within PDF pages without needing separate text extraction steps.\\\\\\\\n- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction, including content loading, question input, and result display.\\\\\\\\n- **Session Management**: Remembers loaded/uploaded content (images and processed PDF pages) within a session.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Python 3.8+\\\\\\\\n- Cohere API key\\\\\\\\n- Google Gemini API key\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow these steps to set up and run the application:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Clone and Navigate to Directory**

Dependencies**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n    *(Ensure you have the latest `PyMuPDF` installed along with other requirements)*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3.  **Set up your API keys**:\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Cohere API key from: [https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Google API key from: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4.  **Run the Streamlit app**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    streamlit run

this URL in your web browser.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe application follows a two-stage RAG process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Retrieval**: \\\\\\\\n    - When you load sample images or upload your own images/PDFs:\\\\\\\\n        - Regular images are converted to base64 strings.\\\\\\\\n        - **PDFs are processed page by page**: Each page is rendered as an image, saved temporarily, and converted to a base64 string.\\\\\\\\n    - Cohere\\'s `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_document\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`) is used to generate a dense vector embedding for each image or PDF page image.\\\\\\\\n    - When you ask a question, the text query is embedded using the same `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_query\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`).\\\\\\\\n    - Cosine similarity is calculated between the question embedding and all image embeddings.\\\\\\\\n    - The image with the highest similarity score (which could be a regular image or a specific PDF page image) is retrieved as the most relevant context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Generation**:\\\\\\\\n    - The original text question and the retrieved image/page image are passed as input to the Google `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model.\\\\\\\\n    - Gemini analyzes the image content in the context of the question and generates a textual answer.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\":

For example:\n   - **LangChain + Redis**: Use the [Redis vector store integration](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) to create RAG pipelines\n   - **LangChain + Qdrant**: Combine LangChain with Qdrant for document storage and retrieval\n\n3. **Embed and Store Data**: \n   - Convert your documents into vector embeddings using models like BERT or GPT\n   - Store embeddings in your vector database for quick retrieval\n   - Use document loaders like `WebBaseLoader` to ingest content\n   - Split documents using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`\n\n4. **Integrate with a Generative Model**: \n   - Connect a language model (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) that can leverage retrieved data\n   - The model uses vectors from the database to augment its generation process\n\n5. **Query and Generate**: \n   - Implement query logic to retrieve relevant vectors based on input prompts\n   - Feed retrieved context into the generative model to produce augmented outputs\n\n### Advanced Patterns\n\n**Agentic RAG with LangGraph**: For more sophisticated workflows, use LangGraph to orchestrate:\n- Document retrieval from vector databases\n- Relevance assessment of retrieved documents\n- Query refinement for better results\n- Fallback mechanisms (e.g., web search when no relevant docs found)\n\n**Database Routing**: Use LangChain with intelligent routing to query multiple specialized databases and automatically select the most relevant source.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/rag.md > Benefits of Using Redis for

application with Redis, follow these general steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Set up Redis**: Start by setting up a Redis instance and configuring it to handle vector data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Use a Framework**:\\\\\\\\n    1. **Redis Vector Library (RedisVL)**: [RedisVL](https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redisvl/) enhances the development of generative AI applications by efficiently managing vectors and metadata. It allows for storage of vector embeddings and facilitates fast similarity searches, crucial for retrieving relevant information in RAG.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Popular AI frameworks**: Redis integrates seamlessly with various AI frameworks and tools. For instance, combining Redis with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) or [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/RedisIndexDemo/), libraries for building language models, enables developers to create sophisticated RAG pipelines. These integrations support efficient data management and building real-time LLM chains.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Spring AI and Redis**: Using [Spring AI with Redis](https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/) simplifies building RAG applications. Spring AI provides a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into applications, while Redis handles data management, ensuring the RAG pipeline is efficient and scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Embed and store data**: Convert your data into vector embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., BERT, GPT). Store these embeddings in Redis, where they can be quickly retrieved based on vector searches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Integrate with a generative model**: Use a generative AI model that can leverage the retrieved data. The model will use the vectors stored in Redis to augment its generation process, ensuring the output is informed by relevant, up-to-date information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Query and generate**: Implement the query logic to retrieve relevant vectors from Redis based on the input prompt. Feed these vectors into the generative model to produce augmented outputs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency**: The in-memory data store of Redis ensures that retrieval operations are performed with minimal latency.\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability**: Redis scales horizontally, seamlessly handling growing volumes of data and queries.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures and integrates with AI frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, Redis offers a powerful and efficient platform for implementing RAG. Its vector management capabilities, high performance, and seamless integration with AI frameworks make it an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI applications with real-time data retrieval.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.329,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3c75fde5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3c75fde5-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/rag_agent_cohere/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG Agent with Cohere ⌘R\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG Agent with Cohere ⌘R\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A RAG Agentic system built with Cohere\\'s new model Command-r7b-12-2024, Qdrant for vector storage, Langchain for RAG and LangGraph for orchestration.

This creates a more natural, interactive experience where users see the AI's response appear progressively, similar to how a human types.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- **Real-time AI Streaming**: Token-by-token response generation using OpenAI's streaming API\n- **Live State Management**: Conversation state updates in real-time with message history\n- **Event-driven Architecture**: Clean API → Event → Streaming Response flow\n- **Progressive Display**: Users see responses as they're generated, not all at once\n\n## How to Build One\n\n### Architecture (3 Core Files)\n\n```\nstreaming-ai-chatbot/\n├── steps/\n│   ├── conversation.stream.ts    # Real-time conversation state\n│   ├── chat-api.step.ts         # Simple chat API endpoint  \n│   └── ai-response.step.ts      # Streaming AI response handler\n├── package.json\n├── .env.example\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n**1. Enable Streaming in OpenAI API**\n\n```typescript\nconst stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',\n  messages: [...],\n  stream: true, // Enable streaming\n})\n\nfor await (const chunk of stream) {\n  // Update state with each token\n  await streams.conversation.set(conversationId, messageId, {\n    message: fullResponse,\n    status: 'streaming',\n    // ...\n  })\n}\n```\n\n**2. Define State Schema**\n\n```typescript\nexport const config: StateStreamConfig = {\n  name: 'conversation',\n  schema: z.object({\n    message: z.string(),\n    from: z.enum(['user', 'assistant']),\n    status: z.enum(['created', 'streaming', 'completed']),\n    timestamp: z.string(),\n  }),\n  baseConfig: { storageType: 'state' },\n}\n```\n\n**3. Set Up Event-Driven Flow**\n\n```typescript\n// API emits event\nawait emit({\n  topic: 'chat-message',\n  data: { message, conversationId, assistantMessageId },\n})\n\n// Event handler subscribes and processes\nexport const config: EventConfig = {\n  subscribes: ['chat-message'],\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**4. API Endpoint**\n\n**POST** `/chat`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"Hello, how are you?\",\n  \"conversationId\": \"optional-conversation-id\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"conversationId\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"message\": \"Message received, AI is responding...\",\n  \"status\": \"streaming\"\n}\n```\n\nStatus values:\n- `created`: Initial message state\n- `streaming`: AI is generating the response\n- `completed`: Response is complete with full message\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_llm_apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/streaming_ai_chatbot\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Configure OpenAI API\ncp .env.example .env\n# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key\n\n# Start the development server\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nNavigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the chatbot.\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n- **Effortless streaming**: Real-time AI responses with automatic state updates\n- **Type-safe events**: End-to-end type safety from API to event handlers\n- **Built-in state management**: No external state libraries needed\n- **Scalable architecture**: Event-driven design that grows with your needs\n- **Minimal Complexity**: Maximum impact with just 3 core files\n\n[来源:

collaborate:\n\n1. **Technical Recruiter Agent**\n   - Analyzes resumes and evaluates technical skills\n   - Performs skills matching and experience verification\n   - Makes selection decisions based on role requirements\n\n2. **Communication Agent**\n   - Handles professional email correspondence with candidates\n   - Drafts automated notifications and feedback\n   - Manages follow-up communications\n\n3. **Scheduling Coordinator Agent**\n   - Manages interview scheduling and coordination\n   - Creates Zoom meetings automatically\n   - Handles calendar management and timezone coordination\n\n## End-to-End Process\n\nThe agents work together to provide:\n- **Automated resume screening** - Candidates upload resumes through a simple interface\n- **Role-specific technical evaluation** - Skills are matched against job requirements\n- **Professional candidate communication** - Automated emails for acceptance/rejection\n- **Automated interview scheduling** - Zoom links sent directly to selected candidates\n- **Integrated feedback system** - Real-time updates throughout the process\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n- Built with **Phidata** framework\n- Uses **OpenAI GPT-4o** for intelligent decision-making\n- Integrates with **Zoom API** for meeting creation\n- Uses **EmailTools** for automated communication\n- Streamlit interface for easy interaction\n\nThe system streamlines the entire recruitment workflow from resume submission to interview scheduling, though it's designed to assist rather than completely replace human judgment in final hiring decisions.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_recruitment_agent_team/README.md > 💼 AI Recruitment Agent Team]", "tools_used":

Destination\n   - Travel dates\n   - Budget constraints\n   - Travel style preferences\n   - Personal preferences\n\n2. **Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents collaborate in parallel to handle their respective domains (flights, hotels, activities, budgeting)\n\n3. **Itinerary Generation**: The system produces a complete day-by-day plan with:\n   - Booking recommendations\n   - Cost breakdowns\n   - Activity suggestions\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n- **Agent Framework**: Powered by **Agno** (a multi-agent orchestration framework)\n- **Frontend**: Streamlit application with MCP integration\n- **Coordination Mode**: Agents operate in coordinated mode for efficient collaboration\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_travel_planner_agent_team/backend/agents/README.md > TripCraft AI -

Here's how an AI chess-playing agent is built:\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe system uses a **multi-agent architecture** with three specialized agents:\n\n1. **Player White Agent** - OpenAI-powered strategic decision maker\n2. **Player Black Agent** - OpenAI-powered tactical opponent  \n3. **Board Proxy Agent** - Validation agent that ensures move legality and maintains game state\n\n## Key Components\n\n**Move Validation System**\n- Robust move verification to prevent illegal moves\n- Real-time board state monitoring\n- Secure game progression control\n\n**AI Decision Making**\n- AI-powered position evaluation\n- Deep tactical analysis\n- Dynamic strategy adaptation\n- Complete chess ruleset implementation\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Framework**: Autogen (for agent orchestration)\n- **LLM**: OpenAI models for both players\n- **UI**: Streamlit for the web interface\n- **Language**: Python\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe two AI agents play against each other while the Board Proxy agent acts as a referee, validating every move to ensure it follows chess rules. Each agent analyzes the board position, evaluates tactics and strategy, then makes decisions autonomously.\n\n[来源:

Using Qdrant Vector Store + Mem0\n\nThe most common pattern uses **Qdrant** as a vector database for storing conversation history and user preferences:\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\ndocker pull qdrant/qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \\\n    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \\\n    qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Persistent memory across sessions\n- User-specific conversation history\n- Memory retrieval for contextual responses\n- Support for multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet)\n\n## 2. Session-Based Memory (OpenAI SDK)\n\nFor OpenAI-based applications, use **SQLite Sessions** for automatic conversation management:\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Automatic conversation history storage\n- Persistent and in-memory storage options\n- Eliminates manual context handling\n- Supports multiple session IDs for different conversations\n\n**How it works:**\n```\nUser Input → Session Memory (retrieve history) \n          → Agent (process with context) \n          → Store new items → Response\n```\n\n## 3. Local Implementation (No External APIs)\n\nFor fully local setups using **Llama 3.1 + Ollama**:\n\n- Local embedding generation with Nomic Embed\n- Vector storage with Qdrant\n- Personal memory space per user\n- No external API dependencies\n\n## 4. Multi-LLM Shared Memory\n\nBuild applications where multiple LLMs share the same memory layer:\n\n- Maintain conversation history across different models\n- User can switch between GPT-4o and Claude while keeping context\n- Centralized memory retrieval system\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\nThe knowledge base contains several working examples:\n- Multi-LLM App with Shared Memory\n- LLM App with Personalized Memory\n- AI Travel Agent with Memory\n- Local ChatGPT Clone with Memory\n\n[来源:

Here's how to build an AI teaching agent team for education:\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nBuild a **multi-agent system with specialized teaching roles**, where each agent acts as a specialized educator working together to create a complete educational experience.\n\n## Specialized Agent Roles\n\nThe teaching agent team should include:\n\n1. **Curriculum Designer** - Designs the overall learning structure and objectives\n2. **Learning Path Expert** - Creates personalized learning pathways for students\n3. **Resource Librarian** - Curates and manages educational resources\n4. **Practice Instructor** - Develops exercises and assessments\n5. **Team Lead/Coordinator** - Orchestrates collaboration between all agents\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Collaborative workflow**: Agents work together like a professional teaching faculty\n- **Document-based output**: Results can be delivered through platforms like Google Docs\n- **Specialized expertise**: Each agent focuses on their domain (curriculum, resources, practice, etc.)\n- **Coordinated execution**: Team lead ensures comprehensive educational experience\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nThe system uses **multi-agent orchestration** patterns:\n- Agents-as-tools pattern for specialized tasks\n- Parallel execution for efficiency\n- Coordinated mode for comprehensive planning\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Clone the repository with the teaching agent team example\n2. Install dependencies (typically includes OpenAI SDK, Streamlit, etc.)\n3. Set up API keys (OpenAI or your preferred LLM provider)\n4. Run the application through a web interface\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Define clear roles and responsibilities for each agent\n- Use a coordinator agent to manage handoffs between specialists\n- Implement proper delegation patterns for task routing\n- Consider using persistent storage (like SQLite) to track interactions\n\n[来源:

It depicts the potential of Agno as a team of collaborative agents working together seamlessly in order to address a real-world challenge - analyzing speech presentations by users and providing them with comprehensive evaluation and feedback to improve their public speaking skills. Each individual agent has a clear cut goal to follow and together they coordinate as a team to solve a complex multimodal problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- This project has a huge potential for further enhancements. It could be a starting point for a more comprehensive and useful agentic systsem. Some of the proposed additional functionalities could be:\\\\\\\\n  1. Incorporating real-time video recording and conversational capabilities through different role scenarios.\\\\\\\\n  2. Playing back the user speech through an AI avatar to help users learn and understand best speaking practices.\\\\\\\\n  3. Keeping a record of user sessions.\\\\\\\\n  4. Including a performance dashboard to track user performance over time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Each of these additional functionalities could be added by implementing specific goal-oriented agents in the system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Together API** with **meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free** as LLM has a small token limit, therefore, it works with small video clips (15-30 seconds).\\\\\\\\n- Use other LLM options for longer video clips.

The knowledge base contains several examples of multimodal agent implementations.\n\n## Key Components\n\n**1. Multimodal AI Model**\n- Use models like Google Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash or Gemini 3 Pro that support both text and image inputs\n- These models can analyze visual content and generate responses based on combined text + image context\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Architecture**\n- Implement a **Coordinator/Dispatcher pattern** with specialized agents\n- Each agent handles a specific aspect of the task\n- Agents work sequentially or in parallel depending on the workflow\n\n**3. Core Implementation Steps**\n\n```bash\n# Setup environment\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/multimodal_design_agent_team\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Get API key from Google AI Studio\n# https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n\n# Run the application\nstreamlit run design_agent_team.py\n```\n\n**4. Agent Orchestration Framework**\n- Use frameworks like **Phidata** or **Google ADK** for agent coordination\n- Implement image processing with Pillow\n- Add external tools (e.g., DuckDuckGo Search API for market research)\n\n**5. Example Architecture (Design Agent Team)**\n\nThree specialized agents:\n- **Visual Design Agent**: Analyzes design elements, colors, typography\n- **UX Analysis Agent**: Evaluates user flows, usability, accessibility\n- **Market Analysis Agent**: Provides competitive insights\n\n**6. Best Practices**\n- Upload clear, high-resolution images for better analysis\n- Provide context about your use case and target audience\n- Support multiple file formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG)\n- Implement real-time processing with progress indicators\n- Structure output for actionable insights\n\n**7. Advanced Features**\n- Comparative analysis (upload multiple images)\n- Iterative refinement based on feedback\n- Sandbox execution environments (using E2B for code execution)\n- Budget-aware planning and recommendations\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/multimodal_design_agent_team/README.md > Multimodal AI Design Agent

Agent Framework Approach**\n- Use frameworks like **Agno v2.0** or **Google ADK** for agent orchestration\n- Implement specialized tools and capabilities for code analysis\n- Structure the agent with clear phases: Input → Analysis → Review → Output\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Team Pattern** (from Legal Agent Team example)\n- Create specialized sub-agents for different review aspects:\n  - **Code Quality Analyst**: Reviews code structure, patterns, best practices\n  - **Security Reviewer**: Identifies vulnerabilities and security issues\n  - **Performance Analyst**: Analyzes efficiency and optimization opportunities\n  - **Team Lead**: Coordinates analysis and synthesizes recommendations\n\n**3. Essential Components**\n- **Real-time Analysis**: Process code files and generate actionable feedback\n- **Interactive UI**: Use Streamlit or similar for easy code submission\n- **Structured Output**: Provide organized feedback with priority levels\n- **Source Attribution**: Reference specific lines/sections of code\n\n**4. Technical Stack Recommendations**\n- LLM: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, or similar advanced models\n- Framework: Agno, Google ADK, or custom agent implementation\n- Tools: Code parsing, static analysis integration, search capabilities\n- UI: Streamlit for interactive interface\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo get the complete code review guidelines and implementation details, you should read the full

Here's what the knowledge base contains:\n\n## Overview\n\nAn AI Services Agency is a multi-agent system that simulates a full-service digital agency using specialized AI agents to analyze and plan software projects. Each agent represents a different role in the project lifecycle, from strategic planning to technical implementation.\n\n## Agent Team Structure\n\nThe agency consists of five specialized agents:\n\n1. **CEO Agent** - Strategic leader and final decision maker\n   - Analyzes startup ideas using structured evaluation\n   - Makes strategic decisions across product, technical, marketing, and financial domains\n   - Uses AnalyzeProjectRequirements tool\n\n2. **CTO Agent** - Technical architecture and feasibility expert\n   - Evaluates technical requirements and feasibility\n   - Provides architecture decisions\n   - Uses CreateTechnicalSpecification tool\n\n3. **Product Manager Agent** - Product strategy specialist\n   - Defines product strategy and roadmap\n   - Coordinates between technical and marketing teams\n   - Focuses on product-market fit\n\n4. **Developer Agent** - Technical implementation expert\n   - Provides detailed technical implementation guidance\n   - Suggests optimal tech stack and cloud solutions\n   - Estimates development costs and timelines\n\n5. **Client Success Agent** - Marketing strategy leader\n   - Develops go-to-market strategies\n   - Plans customer acquisition approaches\n   - Coordinates with product team\n\n## Agent Communication Flows\n\nThe agents coordinate through explicit communication patterns:\n- CEO ↔️ All Agents (Strategic Oversight)\n- CTO ↔️ Developer (Technical Implementation)\n- Product Manager ↔️ Client Success Manager (Go-to-Market Strategy)\n- Product Manager ↔️ Developer (Feature Implementation)\n\n## How to Build It\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_services_agency\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**Run:**\n```bash\nstreamlit run agency.py\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- OpenAI API Key (get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)\n- Specialized tools built with OpenAI Schema for structured analysis\n\n## Key Design Principles\n\n- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has a distinct expertise area\n- **Structured Communication**: Explicit flows between agents prevent chaos\n- **Tool Integration**: Custom tools (AnalyzeProjectRequirements, CreateTechnicalSpecification) enable structured outputs\n- **Coordination**: Team Lead pattern ensures comprehensive analysis\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_services_agency/README.md]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search",

自动连接当前 master\n```\n\n**Java (Jedis):**\n```java\nSet<String> sentinels = new HashSet<>();\nsentinels.add(\"sentinel1:26379\");\nsentinels.add(\"sentinel2:26379\");\nJedisSentinelPool pool = new JedisSentinelPool(\"mymaster\", sentinels);\n```\n\n### 2. 应急处理（临时方案）\n\n如果应用暂时无法修改代码，可以临时允许 replica 写入（不推荐）：\n```bash\nredis-cli -h <replica-host> CONFIG SET replica-read-only no\n```\n\n⚠️ **警告**：这会导致主从数据不一致，仅用于紧急恢复。\n\n### 3. 验证 Sentinel 配置\n\n确认 Sentinel 配置正确：\n```bash\n# 查看当前 master\nredis-cli -h <sentinel-host> -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n\n# 查看 Sentinel 日志确认 failover 事件\ngrep \"+switch-master\" /var/log/redis/sentinel.log\n```\n\n## 监控建议\n\n- 监控 Sentinel 的 `+switch-master` 事件\n- 应用层记录 Redis 连接切换日志\n- 设置告警：Redis 写入延迟突增\n\n---\n\n**来源:**\n- [docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 故障现象](file:///home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/runbook/redis-failover.md)\n- [Redis replication > Read-only replica](file:///home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md)", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["replica", "failover", "SENTINEL", "master", "addr", "主从切换", "Sentinel"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "05978ca7-fb37-4980-8d7f-14b204f34dac", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "10f228a6-7e33-4fbe-8637-ea20b91b90f2", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来帮你检索这个 Redis 报错的解决方案。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_oS6YeHxcYYgIm8sVjoQkmv', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': \"READONLY You can't write against a read only replica\"})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_JcDHrc5258J3kU5P5SnW45', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': \"READONLY You can't write against a read only replica 报错解决\", 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_oS6YeHxcYYgIm8sVjoQkmv', content='Found 2 files\\ndocs/eval-review.md\\ndocs/runbook/redis-failover.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_JcDHrc5258J3kU5P5SnW45', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.578,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/eval-review.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review > 数据格式设计\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"无论是否引入 Ragas，统一数据格式（兼容 Ragas 的 SingleTurnSample）:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ntest_case = {\\\\\\\\n    #

This does not mean that the feature is intended to expose a replica instance to the internet or more generally to a network where untrusted clients exist, because administrative commands like [`DEBUG`](/commands/debug) or [`CONFIG`](/commands/config) are still enabled. The [Security]() page describes how to secure a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may wonder why it is possible to revert the read-only setting\\\\\\\\nand have replica instances that can be targeted by write operations.\\\\\\\\nThe answer is that writable replicas exist only for historical reasons.\\\\\\\\nUsing writable replicas can result in inconsistency between the master and the replica, so it is not recommended to use writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nTo understand in which situations this can be a problem, we need to understand how replication works.\\\\\\\\nChanges on the master is replicated by propagating regular Redis commands to the replica.\\\\\\\\nWhen a key expires on the master, this is propagated as a DEL command.\\\\\\\\nIf a key which exists on the master but is deleted, expired or has a different type on the replica compared to the master will react differently to commands like DEL, INCR or RPOP propagated from the master than intended.\\\\\\\\nThe propagated command may fail on the replica or result in a different outcome.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risks (if you insist on using writable replicas) we suggest you follow these recommendations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t write to keys in a writable replica that are also used on the master.\\\\\\\\n  (This can be hard to guarantee if you don\\'t have control over all the clients that write to the master.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica as an intermediary step when upgrading a set of instances in a running system.\\\\\\\\n  In general, don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica if it can ever be promoted to a master if you want to guarantee data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHistorically, there were some use cases that were considered legitimate for writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, these use cases are now all obsolete and the same can be achieved by other means.\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Computing slow Set or Sorted set operations and storing the result in temporary local keys using commands like [`SUNIONSTORE`](/commands/sunionstore) and [`ZINTERSTORE`](/commands/zinterstore).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use commands that return the result without storing it, such as [`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and [`ZINTER`](/commands/zinter).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using the [`SORT`](/commands/sort) command (which is not considered a read-only command because of the optional STORE option and therefore cannot be used on a read-only replica).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`SORT_RO`](/commands/sort_ro), which is a read-only command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using [`EVAL`](/commands/eval) and [`EVALSHA`](/commands/evalsha) are also not considered read-only commands, because the Lua script may call write commands.\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`EVAL_RO`](/commands/eval_ro) and [`EVALSHA_RO`](/commands/evalsha_ro) where the Lua script can only call read-only commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile writes to a replica will be discarded if the replica and the master resync or if the replica is restarted, there is no guarantee that they will sync automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore version 4.0, writable replicas were incapable of expiring keys with a time to live set.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if you use [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) or other commands that set a maximum TTL for a key, the key will leak, and while you may no longer see it while accessing it with read commands, you will see it in the count of keys and it will still use memory.\\\\\\\\nRedis 4.0 RC3 and greater versions are able to evict keys with TTL as masters do, with the exceptions of keys written in DB numbers greater than 63 (but by default Redis instances only have 16 databases).\\\\\\\\nNote though that even in versions greater than 4.0, using [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) on a key that could ever exists on the master can cause inconsistency between the replica and the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that since Redis 4.0 replica writes are only local, and are not propagated to sub-replicas attached to the instance. Sub-replicas instead will always receive the replication stream identical to the one sent by the top-level master to the intermediate replicas. So for example in the following setup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    A ---> B ---> C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if `B` is writable, C will not see `B` writes and will instead have identical dataset as the master instance `A`.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.2593,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis functions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Function flags\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In some cases there may be a need to start a fresh Redis server with a set of functions pre-loaded. Common reasons for that could be:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Starting Redis in a new environment\\\\\\\\n* Re-starting an ephemeral (cache-only) Redis, that uses functions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, we need to make sure that the pre-loaded functions are available before Redis accepts inbound user connections and commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo do that, it is possible to use `redis-cli --functions-rdb` to extract the functions from an existing server. This generates an RDB file that can be loaded by Redis at startup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis needs to have some information about how a function is going to behave when executed, in order to properly enforce resource usage policies and maintain data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, Redis needs to know that a certain function is read-only before permitting it to execute using [`FCALL_RO`]() on a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all functions may perform arbitrary read or write operations. Function Flags make it possible to declare more specific function behavior at the time of registration. Let\\'s see how this works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our previous example, we defined two functions that only read data. We can try executing them using [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis > FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n(error) ERR Can not execute a function with write flag using fcall_ro.\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis returns this error because a function can, in theory, perform both read and write operations on the database.\\\\\\\\nAs a safeguard and by default, Redis assumes that the function does both, so it blocks its execution.\\\\\\\\nThe server will reply with this error in the following cases:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Executing a function with [`FCALL`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n2. Using [`FCALL_RO`]() to execute a function.\\\\\\\\n3. A disk error was detected (Redis is unable to persist so it rejects writes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn these cases, you can add the `no-writes` flag to the function\\'s registration, disable the safeguard and allow them to run.\\\\\\\\nTo register a function with flags use the [named arguments]() variant of `redis.register_function`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe updated registration code snippet from the library looks like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function(\\'my_hset\\', my_hset)\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hgetall\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hgetall,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hlastmodified\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hlastmodified,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce we\\'ve replaced the library, Redis allows running both `my_hgetall` and `my_hlastmodified` with [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"myfield\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"some value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_field\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hlastmodified 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1640772721\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the complete documentation flags, please refer to [Script flags]().\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.3325,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Lua API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"_redis_ object {#redis_object} > `redis.register_function` {#redis.register_function} > Script flags {#script_flags}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Important:**\\\\\\\\nUse script flags with care, which may negatively impact if misused.\\\\\\\\nNote that the default for Eval scripts are different than the default for functions that are mentioned below, see [Eval Flags]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you register a function or load an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nThis results in the following behavior:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

With [`FCALL_RO`]() / [`EVAL_RO`]()\\\\\\\\n    2. On read-only replicas.\\\\\\\\n    3. Even if there\\'s a disk error (Redis is unable to persist so it rejects writes).\\\\\\\\n    4.

The following is the list of its subcommands (minimal version is noted for where applicable):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG GET `<name>`** (`>= 6.2`) Get the current value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter. The specified name may be a wildcard, similar to the Redis [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG SET `<name>` `<value>`** (`>= 6.2`) Set the value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CKQUORUM `<master name>`** Check if the current Sentinel configuration is able to reach the quorum needed to failover a master, and the majority needed to authorize the failover. This command should be used in monitoring systems to check if a Sentinel deployment is ok.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FLUSHCONFIG** Force Sentinel to rewrite its configuration on disk, including the current Sentinel state. Normally Sentinel rewrites the configuration every time something changes in its state (in the context of the subset of the state which is persisted on disk across restart). However sometimes it is possible that the configuration file is lost because of operation errors, disk failures, package upgrade scripts or configuration managers. In those cases a way to force Sentinel to rewrite the configuration file is handy. This command works even if the previous configuration file is completely missing.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FAILOVER `<master name>`** Force a failover as if the master was not reachable, and without asking for agreement to other Sentinels (however a new version of the configuration will be published so that the other Sentinels will update their configurations).\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL GET-MASTER-ADDR-BY-NAME `<master name>`** Return the ip and port number of the master with that name. If a failover is in progress or terminated successfully for this master it returns the address and port of the promoted replica.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL INFO-CACHE** (`>= 3.2`) Return cached [`INFO`](/commands/info) output from masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR <ip> <port> <current-epoch> <runid>** Check if the master specified by ip:port is down from current Sentinel\\'s point of view. This command is mostly for internal use.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTER `<master name>`** Show the state and info of the specified master.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTERS** Show a list of monitored masters and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MONITOR** Start Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MYID** (`>= 6.2`) Return the ID of the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL PENDING-SCRIPTS** This command returns information about pending scripts.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REMOVE** Stop Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REPLICAS `<master name>`** (`>= 5.0`) Show a list of replicas for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SENTINELS `<master name>`** Show a list of sentinel instances for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SET** Set Sentinel\\'s monitoring configuration. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SIMULATE-FAILURE (crash-after-election|crash-after-promotion|help)** (`>= 3.2`) This command simulates different Sentinel crash scenarios.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL RESET `<pattern>`** This command will reset all the masters with matching name. The pattern argument is a glob-style pattern. The reset process clears any previous state in a master (including a failover in progress), and removes every replica and sentinel already discovered and associated with the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor connection management and administration purposes, Sentinel supports the following subset of Redis\\' commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **ACL** (`>= 6.2`) This command manages the Sentinel Access Control List. For more information refer to the [ACL]() documentation page and the [_Sentinel Access Control List authentication_](#sentinel-access-control-list-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **AUTH** (`>= 5.0.1`) Authenticate a client connection. For more information refer to the [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command and the [_Configuring Sentinel instances with authentication_ section](#configuring-sentinel-instances-with-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **CLIENT** This command manages client connections. For more information refer to its subcommands\\' pages.\\\\\\\\n* **COMMAND** (`>= 6.2`) This command returns information about commands. For more information refer to the [`COMMAND`](/commands/command) command and its various subcommands.\\\\\\\\n* **HELLO** (`>= 6.0`) Switch the connection\\'s protocol. For more information refer to the [`HELLO`](/commands/hello) command.\\\\\\\\n* **INFO** Return information and statistics about the Sentinel server. For more information see the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command.\\\\\\\\n* **PING** This command simply returns PONG.\\\\\\\\n* **ROLE** This command returns the string \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a list of monitored masters. For more information refer to the [`ROLE`](/commands/role) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SHUTDOWN** Shut down the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, Sentinel also supports the [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe), [`UNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/unsubscribe), [`PSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/psubscribe) and [`PUNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/punsubscribe) commands.

If you set a password\\\\\\\\nand check the output of [`ACL LIST`](/commands/acl-list) or [`ACL GETUSER`](/commands/acl-getuser), you\\'ll see a long hex\\\\\\\\nstring that looks pseudo random. Here is an example, because in the previous\\\\\\\\nexamples, for the sake of brevity, the long hex string was trimmed:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> ACL GETUSER default\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"flags\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"on\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"passwords\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2d9c75273d72b32df726fb545c8a4edc719f0a95a6fd993950b10c474ad9c927\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"commands\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"+@all\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"keys\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"~*\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"channels\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"&*\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"selectors\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing SHA256 provides the ability to avoid storing the password in clear text\\\\\\\\nwhile still allowing for a very fast [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command, which is a very important\\\\\\\\nfeature of Redis and is coherent with what clients expect from Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever ACL *passwords* are not really passwords. They are shared secrets\\\\\\\\nbetween the server and the client, because the password is\\\\\\\\nnot an authentication token used by a human being. For instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* There are no length limits, the password will just be memorized in some client software. There is no human that needs to recall a password in this context.\\\\\\\\n* The ACL password does not protect any other thing. For example, it will never be the password for some email account.\\\\\\\\n* Often when you are able to access the hashed password itself, by having full access to the Redis commands of a given server, or corrupting the system itself, you already have access to what the password is protecting: the Redis instance stability and the data it contains.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor this reason, slowing down the password authentication, in order to use an\\\\\\\\nalgorithm that uses time and space to make password cracking hard,\\\\\\\\nis a very poor choice. What we suggest instead is to generate strong\\\\\\\\npasswords, so that nobody will be able to crack it using a\\\\\\\\ndictionary or a brute force attack even if they have the hash. To do so, there is a special ACL\\\\\\\\ncommand [`ACL GENPASS`](/commands/acl-genpass) that generates passwords using the system cryptographic pseudorandom\\\\\\\\ngenerator:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    > ACL GENPASS\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"dd721260bfe1b3d9601e7fbab36de6d04e2e67b0ef1c53de59d45950db0dd3cc\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe command outputs a 32-byte (256-bit) pseudorandom string converted to a\\\\\\\\n64-byte alphanumerical string. This is long enough to avoid attacks and short\\\\\\\\nenough to be easy to manage, cut & paste, store, and so forth. This is what\\\\\\\\nyou should use in order to generate Redis passwords.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.0464,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"498bf3fa\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"498bf3fa-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/archive/STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🎉 知识库搜索系统 - 已达到良好状态 > 🎯 当前状态\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"unknown\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**系统已达到良好状态，可以进行性能测试和演示！**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**后台任务**:\\\\\\\\n- K8s 文档索引: 进行中（8/10）\\\\\\\\n- Redis 文档索引: 进行中（7/10）\\\\\\\\n- 预计完成时间: 5-10 分钟\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**建议**:\\\\\\\\n等待索引完成后，运行性能测试验证核心价值假设。\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**准备就绪！** 🎉\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.6749,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e051e108\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e051e108-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"PROJECT_STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🎉 知识库搜索系统 - 项目完成状态 > 💡 核心价值 > 4.

This includes a stack trace, dump of registers, and information about the state of clients.\\\\\\\\n* Since Redis 2.8, a fast memory test is performed as a first check of the reliability of the crashing system.\\\\\\\\n* If the server was daemonized, the PID file is removed.\\\\\\\\n* Finally the server unregisters its own signal handler for the received signal and resends the same signal to itself to make sure that the default action is performed, such as dumping the core on the file system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the child performing the Append Only File rewrite gets killed by a signal,\\\\\\\\nRedis handles this as an error and discards the (probably partial or corrupted)\\\\\\\\nAOF file. It will attempt the rewrite again later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the child performing an RDB save is killed, Redis handles the\\\\\\\\ncondition as a more severe error. While the failure of an\\\\\\\\nAOF file rewrite can cause AOF file enlargement, failed RDB file\\\\\\\\ncreation reduces durability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result of the child producing the RDB file being killed by a signal,\\\\\\\\nor when the child exits with an error (non zero exit code), Redis enters\\\\\\\\na special error condition where no further write command is accepted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis will continue to reply to read commands.\\\\\\\\n* Redis will reply to all write commands with a `MISCONFIG` error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis error condition will persist until it becomes possible to create an RDB file successfully.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes the user may want to kill the RDB-saving child process without\\\\\\\\ngenerating an error. Since Redis version 2.6.10, this can be done using the signal `SIGUSR1`. This signal is handled in a special way:\\\\\\\\nit kills the child process like any other signal, but the parent process will\\\\\\\\nnot detect this as a critical error and will continue to serve write\\\\\\\\nrequests.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.1587,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/runbook/redis-failover.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册 > 恢复操作 > 手动恢复\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"如果应用使用 Sentinel 客户端（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会自动切换。检查：\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. 确认客户端配置了 Sentinel 地址而非直连 master\\\\\\\\n2. 确认连接池的 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置已开启\\\\\\\\n3. 等待 30 秒，观察错误率是否下降\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n如果应用直连 master IP：\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. 获取新 master 地址：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\\\\\\\\n2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\\\\\\\\n3. 滚动重启应用 Pod\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nkubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.5003,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Transactions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Discarding the command queue\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"During a transaction it is possible to encounter two kind of command errors:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A command may fail to be queued, so there may be an error before [`EXEC`]() is called.\\\\\\\\nFor instance the command may be syntactically wrong (wrong number of arguments,\\\\\\\\nwrong command name, ...), or there may be some critical condition like an out of\\\\\\\\nmemory condition (if the server is configured to have a memory limit using the `maxmemory` directive).\\\\\\\\n* A command may fail *after* [`EXEC`]() is called, for instance since we performed\\\\\\\\nan operation against a key with the wrong value (like calling a list operation against a string value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStarting with Redis 2.6.5, the server will detect an error during the accumulation of commands.\\\\\\\\nIt will then refuse to execute the transaction returning an error during [`EXEC`](), discarding the transaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Note for Redis < 2.6.5:** Prior to Redis 2.6.5 clients needed to detect errors occurring prior to [`EXEC`]() by checking\\\\\\\\nthe return value of the queued command: if the command replies with QUEUED it was\\\\\\\\nqueued correctly, otherwise Redis returns an error.\\\\\\\\nIf there is an error while queueing a command, most clients\\\\\\\\nwill abort and discard the transaction.

This may\\\\\\\\nsound unexpected as in the first part of this tutorial we stated that Redis\\\\\\\\nCluster can lose writes during the failover because it uses asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication. What we did not say is that this is not very likely to happen\\\\\\\\nbecause Redis sends the reply to the client, and the commands to replicate\\\\\\\\nto the replicas, about at the same time, so there is a very small window to\\\\\\\\nlose data.

their output should be presented to the human user as is and without quoting the string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, the Redis command [`INFO`]() outputs a report that includes newlines.\\\\\\\\nWhen using RESP3, `redis-cli` displays it correctly because it is sent as a Verbatim String reply (with its three bytes being \\\\\\\\\\\\\"txt\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\\\\nWhen using

strings](#simple-strings), but their first character is the minus (`-`) character.\\\\\\\\nThe difference between simple strings and errors in RESP is that clients should treat errors as exceptions, whereas the string encoded in the error type is the error message itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe basic format is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    -Error message\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis replies with an error only when something goes wrong, for example, when you try to operate against the wrong data type, or when the command does not exist.\\\\\\\\nThe client should raise an exception when it receives an Error reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following are examples of error replies:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    -ERR unknown command \\'asdf\\'\\\\\\\\n    -WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first upper-case word after the `-`, up to the first space or newline, represents the kind of error returned.\\\\\\\\nThis word is called an _error prefix_.\\\\\\\\nNote that the error prefix is a convention used by Redis rather than part of the RESP error type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, in Redis, `ERR` is a generic error, whereas `WRONGTYPE` is a more specific error that implies that the client attempted an operation against the wrong data type.\\\\\\\\nThe error prefix allows the client to understand the type of error returned by the server without checking the exact error message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client implementation can return different types of exceptions for various errors, or provide a generic way for trapping errors by directly providing the error name to the caller as a string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, such a feature should not be considered vital as it is rarely useful. \\\\\\\\nAlso, simpler client implementations can return a generic error value, such as `false`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a

状态和事件\n```bash\nkubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>\n```\n\n重点关注：\n- **OOMKilled** — 容器超出内存限制\n- **Error** — 应用启动时崩溃\n- **ContainerCannotRun** — 镜像或入口点问题\n\n### 2. 查看日志\n```bash\n# 当前崩溃的日志\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>\n\n# 上一次崩溃的日志（更有价值）\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous\n```\n\n### 3. 检查资源限制\n```bash\nkubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].resources}'\n```\n\n如果是 OOMKilled，增加内存限制：\n```yaml\nresources:\n  requests:\n    memory: \"256Mi\"\n  limits:\n    memory: \"512Mi\"\n```\n\n### 4. 检查存活探针配置\n```bash\nkubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].livenessProbe}'\n```\n\n常见问题：\n- `initialDelaySeconds` 太短（应用启动慢）\n- 健康检查端点实现错误\n- 探针超时设置过于激进\n\n## 常见原因和解决方案\n\n| 原因 | 解决方法 |\n|------|---------|\n| OOMKilled | 增加内存限制或修复内存泄漏 |\n| 配置错误 | 检查 ConfigMap/Secret 挂载、环境变量 |\n| 依赖服务缺失 | 确保依赖的服务正在运行 |\n| 镜像问题 | 验证镜像标签和仓库访问权限 |\n| 存活探针失败 | 调整探针时间或修复健康检查端点 |\n| 权限拒绝 | 检查 SecurityContext 和 RBAC |\n\n## 紧急处理\n\n如果问题持续超过 30 分钟：\n1. 通知应用团队负责人\n2. 查看最近的部署历史：`kubectl rollout history deployment/<name>`\n3. 考虑回滚：`kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name>`\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/kubernetes-pod-crashloop.md > Kubernetes Pod CrashLoopBackOff Troubleshooting Guide]**", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"],

Token\n\n系统设计了双 token 机制来避免频繁登录：\n\n1. **access_token**（短期）：15 分钟有效期，用于日常 API 请求\n2. **refresh_token**（长期）：7 天有效期，用于自动刷新 access_token\n\n### 工作流程\n\n```\n用户登录 → 获得 access_token (15分钟) + refresh_token (7天)\n    ↓\n使用 access_token 访问 API\n    ↓\n15分钟后 access_token 过期\n    ↓\n客户端自动用 refresh_token 调用 /api/v1/auth/refresh\n    ↓\n获得新的 access_token + 新的 refresh_token（旧的立即失效）\n    ↓\n继续使用新 token，无需重新输入密码\n```\n\n### 实现方式\n\n当 API 返回 `401 TOKEN_EXPIRED` 错误时，客户端应该：\n\n1. 用 refresh_token 请求 `/api/v1/auth/refresh` 端点\n2. 获取新的 access_token\n3. 重试原来的请求\n\n这样用户可以保持 **7 天免登录**，只要在这期间有使用过系统。\n\n### 安全特性\n\n- refresh_token 是**单次使用**的，用完立即轮换（防止重放攻击）\n- 所有 token 必须通过 HTTPS 传输\n- 登录失败超过 5 次会锁定账户 30 分钟\n\n**[来源: docs/api/authentication.md > Token 验证 & API 错误码]**",

However, a new version of the configuration will be published so that other Sentinels will update their configurations accordingly.\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **No consensus required**: Unlike automatic failovers, this command doesn't require agreement from other Sentinels\n- **Configuration propagation**: The new configuration is still broadcast to other Sentinels so they can update\n- **Use case**: Commonly used for maintenance tasks, such as upgrading a Redis master instance with minimal downtime\n\n## Manual Failover Process\n\nWhen you execute a manual failover on a replica, the system ensures data safety by:\n\n1. Pausing clients connected to the current master\n2. The master sends its replication offset to the replica\n3. The replica waits until it processes all replication data from the old master\n4. Only then does the failover election start\n5. Clients are redirected to the new master once the switch is complete\n\nThis approach avoids data loss by ensuring the new master has processed all replication stream from the old master before taking over.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Sentinel API > Sentinel commands]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["replica", "failover", "SENTINEL", "master", "manual", "Sentinel"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "498a205b-8323-4a21-80bd-dd22399175de", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "117bfc2c-1e2b-48ba-ae33-333e5251a0fc", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about manually triggering Redis Sentinel failover.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_sXgh8Pnz2U7v66Dk4PcoUE', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'sentinel failover|SENTINEL FAILOVER|manual failover'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_V6X7jp0VV49xSdwtdUmsej', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'manually trigger Redis Sentinel failover command', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_sXgh8Pnz2U7v66Dk4PcoUE', content='Found 2 files\\ndocs/eval-review.md\\ndocs/runbook/redis-failover.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_V6X7jp0VV49xSdwtdUmsej', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.9487,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis service discovery via Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel is a monitoring solution for Redis instances that handles\\\\\\\\nautomatic failover of Redis masters and service discovery (who is the current\\\\\\\\nmaster for a given group of instances?).

The following is the list of its subcommands (minimal version is noted for where applicable):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG GET `<name>`** (`>= 6.2`) Get the current value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter. The specified name may be a wildcard, similar to the Redis [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG SET `<name>` `<value>`** (`>= 6.2`) Set the value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CKQUORUM `<master name>`** Check if the current Sentinel configuration is able to reach the quorum needed to failover a master, and the majority needed to authorize the failover. This command should be used in monitoring systems to check if a Sentinel deployment is ok.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FLUSHCONFIG** Force Sentinel to rewrite its configuration on disk, including the current Sentinel state. Normally Sentinel rewrites the configuration every time something changes in its state (in the context of the subset of the state which is persisted on disk across restart). However sometimes it is possible that the configuration file is lost because of operation errors, disk failures, package upgrade scripts or configuration managers. In those cases a way to force Sentinel to rewrite the configuration file is handy. This command works even if the previous configuration file is completely missing.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FAILOVER `<master name>`** Force a failover as if the master was not reachable, and without asking for agreement to other Sentinels (however a new version of the configuration will be published so that the other Sentinels will update their configurations).\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL GET-MASTER-ADDR-BY-NAME `<master name>`** Return the ip and port number of the master with that name. If a failover is in progress or terminated successfully for this master it returns the address and port of the promoted replica.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL INFO-CACHE** (`>= 3.2`) Return cached [`INFO`](/commands/info) output from masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR <ip> <port> <current-epoch> <runid>** Check if the master specified by ip:port is down from current Sentinel\\'s point of view. This command is mostly for internal use.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTER `<master name>`** Show the state and info of the specified master.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTERS** Show a list of monitored masters and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MONITOR** Start Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MYID** (`>= 6.2`) Return the ID of the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL PENDING-SCRIPTS** This command returns information about pending scripts.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REMOVE** Stop Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REPLICAS `<master name>`** (`>= 5.0`) Show a list of replicas for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SENTINELS `<master name>`** Show a list of sentinel instances for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SET** Set Sentinel\\'s monitoring configuration. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SIMULATE-FAILURE (crash-after-election|crash-after-promotion|help)** (`>= 3.2`) This command simulates different Sentinel crash scenarios.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL RESET `<pattern>`** This command will reset all the masters with matching name. The pattern argument is a glob-style pattern. The reset process clears any previous state in a master (including a failover in progress), and removes every replica and sentinel already discovered and associated with the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor connection management and administration purposes, Sentinel supports the following subset of Redis\\' commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **ACL** (`>= 6.2`) This command manages the Sentinel Access Control List. For more information refer to the [ACL]() documentation page and the [_Sentinel Access Control List authentication_](#sentinel-access-control-list-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **AUTH** (`>= 5.0.1`) Authenticate a client connection. For more information refer to the [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command and the [_Configuring Sentinel instances with authentication_ section](#configuring-sentinel-instances-with-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **CLIENT** This command manages client connections. For more information refer to its subcommands\\' pages.\\\\\\\\n* **COMMAND** (`>= 6.2`) This command returns information about commands. For more information refer to the [`COMMAND`](/commands/command) command and its various subcommands.\\\\\\\\n* **HELLO** (`>= 6.0`) Switch the connection\\'s protocol. For more information refer to the [`HELLO`](/commands/hello) command.\\\\\\\\n* **INFO** Return information and statistics about the Sentinel server. For more information see the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command.\\\\\\\\n* **PING** This command simply returns PONG.\\\\\\\\n* **ROLE** This command returns the string \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a list of monitored masters. For more information refer to the [`ROLE`](/commands/role) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SHUTDOWN** Shut down the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, Sentinel also supports the [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe), [`UNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/unsubscribe), [`PSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/psubscribe) and [`PUNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/punsubscribe) commands.

At the same time all the Sentinels wait for messages to see what is the configuration\\\\\\\\nadvertised by the other Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfigurations are broadcast in the `__sentinel__:hello` Pub/Sub channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause every configuration has a different version number, the greater version\\\\\\\\nalways wins over smaller versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example the configuration for the master `mymaster` start with all the\\\\\\\\nSentinels believing the master is at 192.168.1.50:6379. This configuration\\\\\\\\nhas version 1. After some time a Sentinel is authorized to failover with version 2. If the failover is successful, it will start to broadcast a new configuration, let\\'s say 192.168.1.50:9000, with version 2. All the other instances will see this configuration and will update their configuration accordingly, since the new configuration has a greater version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that Sentinel guarantees a second liveness property: a set of\\\\\\\\nSentinels that are able to communicate will all converge to the same configuration with the higher version number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically if the net is partitioned, every partition will converge to the higher\\\\\\\\nlocal configuration. In the special case of no partitions, there is a single\\\\\\\\npartition and every Sentinel will agree about the configuration.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2875,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Manual failover\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Sometimes it is useful to force a failover without actually causing any problem\\\\\\\\non a master. For example, to upgrade the Redis process of one of the\\\\\\\\nmaster nodes it is a good idea to failover it to turn it into a replica\\\\\\\\nwith minimal impact on availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are supported by Redis Cluster using the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)\\\\\\\\ncommand, that must be executed in one of the replicas of the master you want\\\\\\\\nto failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are special and are safer compared to failovers resulting from\\\\\\\\nactual master failures. They occur in a way that avoids data loss in the\\\\\\\\nprocess, by switching clients from the original master to the new master only\\\\\\\\nwhen the system is sure that the new master processed all the replication stream\\\\\\\\nfrom the old one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what you see in the replica log when you perform a manual failover:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Manual failover user request accepted.\\\\\\\\n    # Received replication offset for paused master manual failover: 347540\\\\\\\\n    # All master replication stream processed, manual failover can start.\\\\\\\\n    # Start of election delayed for 0 milliseconds (rank #0, offset 347540).\\\\\\\\n    # Starting a failover election for epoch 7545.\\\\\\\\n    # Failover election won: I\\'m the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically clients connected to the master we are failing over are stopped.\\\\\\\\nAt the same time the master sends its replication offset to the replica, that\\\\\\\\nwaits to reach the offset on its side. When the replication offset is reached,\\\\\\\\nthe failover starts, and the old master is informed about the configuration\\\\\\\\nswitch. When the clients are unblocked on the old master, they are redirected\\\\\\\\nto the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTo promote a replica to master, it must first be known as a replica by a majority of the masters in the cluster.\\\\\\\\n  Otherwise, it cannot win the failover election.\\\\\\\\n  If the replica has just been added to the cluster (see [Add a new node as a replica](#add-a-new-node-as-a-replica)), you may need to wait a while before sending the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover) command, to make sure the masters in cluster are aware of the new replica.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6095,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-022\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > SDOWN and ODOWN failure state\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel has two different concepts of *being down*, one is called\\\\\\\\na *Subjectively Down* condition (SDOWN) and is a down condition that is\\\\\\\\nlocal to a given Sentinel instance. Another is called *Objectively Down*\\\\\\\\ncondition (ODOWN) and is reached when enough Sentinels (at least the\\\\\\\\nnumber configured as the `quorum` parameter of the monitored master) have\\\\\\\\nan SDOWN condition, and get feedback from other Sentinels using\\\\\\\\nthe `SENTINEL is-master-down-by-addr` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of a Sentinel an SDOWN condition is reached when it\\\\\\\\ndoes not receive a valid reply to PING requests for the number of seconds\\\\\\\\nspecified in the configuration as `is-master-down-after-milliseconds`\\\\\\\\nparameter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn acceptable reply to PING is one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with +PONG.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -LOADING error.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -MASTERDOWN error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAny other reply (or no reply at all) is considered non valid.\\\\\\\\nHowever note that **a logical master that advertises itself as a replica in\\\\\\\\nthe INFO output is considered to be down**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that SDOWN requires that no acceptable reply is received for the whole\\\\\\\\ninterval configured, so for instance if the interval is 30000 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n(30 seconds) and we receive an acceptable ping reply every 29 seconds, the\\\\\\\\ninstance is considered to be working.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSDOWN is not enough to trigger a failover: it only means a single Sentinel\\\\\\\\nbelieves a Redis instance is not available. To trigger a failover, the\\\\\\\\nODOWN state must be reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo switch from SDOWN to ODOWN no strong consensus algorithm is used, but\\\\\\\\njust a form of gossip: if a given Sentinel gets reports that a master\\\\\\\\nis not working from enough Sentinels **in a given time range**, the SDOWN is\\\\\\\\npromoted to ODOWN. If this acknowledge is later missing, the flag is cleared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA more strict authorization that uses an actual majority is required in\\\\\\\\norder to really start the failover, but no failover can be triggered without\\\\\\\\nreaching the ODOWN state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ODOWN condition **only applies to masters**. For other kind of instances\\\\\\\\nSentinel doesn\\'t require to act, so the ODOWN state is never reached for replicas\\\\\\\\nand other sentinels, but only SDOWN is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever SDOWN has also semantic implications. For example a replica in SDOWN\\\\\\\\nstate is not selected to be promoted by a Sentinel performing a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels and replicas auto discovery\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels stay connected with other Sentinels in order to reciprocally\\\\\\\\ncheck the availability of each other, and to exchange messages. However you\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t need to configure a list of other Sentinel addresses in every Sentinel\\\\\\\\ninstance you run, as Sentinel uses the Redis instances Pub/Sub capabilities\\\\\\\\nin order to discover the other Sentinels that are monitoring the same masters\\\\\\\\nand replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is implemented by sending *hello messages* into the channel named\\\\\\\\n`__sentinel__:hello`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly you don\\'t need to configure what is the list of the replicas attached\\\\\\\\nto a master, as Sentinel will auto discover this list querying Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel publishes a message to every monitored master and replica Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello`, every two seconds, announcing its presence with ip, port, runid.\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel is subscribed to the Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello` of every master and replica, looking for unknown sentinels. When new sentinels are detected, they are added as sentinels of this master.\\\\\\\\n* Hello messages also include the full current configuration of the master. If the receiving Sentinel has a configuration for a given master which is older than the one received, it updates to the new configuration immediately.\\\\\\\\n* Before adding a new sentinel to a master a Sentinel always checks if there is already a sentinel with the same runid or the same address (ip and port pair). In that case all the matching sentinels are removed, and the new added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel reconfiguration of instances outside the failover procedure\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven when no failover is in progress, Sentinels will always try to set the\\\\\\\\ncurrent configuration on monitored instances. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Replicas (according to the current configuration) that claim to be masters, will be configured as replicas to replicate with the current master.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas connected to a wrong master, will be reconfigured to replicate with the right master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinels to reconfigure replicas, the wrong configuration must be observed for some time, that is greater than the period used to broadcast new configurations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis prevents Sentinels with a stale configuration (for example because they just rejoined from a partition) will try to change the replicas configuration before receiving an update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note how the semantics of always trying to impose the current configuration makes the failover more resistant to partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Masters failed over are reconfigured as replicas when they return available.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas partitioned away during a partition are reconfigured once reachable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe important lesson to remember about this section is: **Sentinel is a system where each process will always try to impose the last logical configuration to the set of monitored instances**.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Based on the search results, here's how to manually trigger a Redis Sentinel failover:\\n\\n## Command\\n\\n```bash\\nSENTINEL FAILOVER <master name>\\n```\\n\\nThis command forces a failover as if the master was not reachable, without asking for agreement from other Sentinels.

in Redis Open Source used to estimate the `K` highest-rank elements from a stream.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Highest-rank\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in this case means \\\\\\\\\\\\\"elements with a highest number or score attached to them\\\\\\\\\\\\\", where the score can be a count of how many times the element has appeared in the stream - thus making the data structure perfect for finding the elements with the highest frequency in a stream.\\\\\\\\nOne very common application is detecting network anomalies and DDoS attacks where Top K can answer the question: Is there a sudden increase in the flux of requests to the same address or from the same IP?\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Open Source implementation of Top-K is based on the [HeavyKeepers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong) algorithm presented by Junzhi Gong et al. It discards some older approaches like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"count-all\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"admit-all-count-some\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in favour of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**count-with-exponential-decay**\\\\\\\\\\\\\" strategy which is biased against mouse (small) flows and has a limited impact on elephant (large) flows. This implementation uses two data structures in tandem: a hash table that holds the probabilistic counts (much like the Count-Min Sketch), and a min heap that holds the `K` items with the highest counts. This ensures high accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms allowed, while keeping memory utilization to a fraction of what is typically required by a Sorted Set. It has the additional benefit of being able to get real time notifications when elements are added or removed from the Top K list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trending hashtags (social media platforms, news distribution networks)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What are the K hashtags people have mentioned the most in the last X hours? \\\\\\\\n- What are the K news with highest read/view count today? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData flow is the incoming social media posts from which you parse out the different hashtags. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`TOPK.LIST`]() command has a time complexity of `O(K*log(k))` so if `K` is small, there is no need to keep a separate set or sorted set of all the hashtags.

When a Module is unloaded, all the\\\\\\\\nauth callbacks registered by it are unregistered.\\\\\\\\nThe callbacks are attempted (in the order of most recently registered first) when the AUTH/HELLO\\\\\\\\n(with AUTH field provided) commands are called.\\\\\\\\nThe callbacks will be called with a module context along with a username and a password, and are\\\\\\\\nexpected to take one of the following actions:\\\\\\\\n(1) Authenticate - Use the `RedisModule_AuthenticateClient`* API and return `REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED`.\\\\\\\\nThis will immediately end the auth chain as successful and add the OK reply.\\\\\\\\n(2) Deny Authentication - Return `REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED` without authenticating or blocking the\\\\\\\\nclient. Optionally, `err` can be set to a custom error message and `err` will be automatically\\\\\\\\nfreed by the server.\\\\\\\\nThis will immediately end the auth chain as unsuccessful and add the ERR reply.\\\\\\\\n(3) Block a client on authentication - Use the [`RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth`](#RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth) API and return\\\\\\\\n`REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED`. Here, the client will be blocked until the [`RedisModule_UnblockClient`](#RedisModule_UnblockClient) API is used\\\\\\\\nwhich will trigger the auth reply callback (provided through the [`RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth`](#RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth)).\\\\\\\\nIn this reply callback, the Module should authenticate, deny or skip handling authentication.\\\\\\\\n(4) Skip handling Authentication - Return `REDISMODULE_AUTH_NOT_HANDLED` without blocking the\\\\\\\\nclient. This will allow the engine to attempt the next module auth callback.\\\\\\\\nIf none of the callbacks authenticate or deny auth, then password based auth is attempted and\\\\\\\\nwill authenticate or add failure logs and reply to the clients accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: If a client is disconnected while it was in the middle of blocking module auth, that\\\\\\\\noccurrence of the AUTH or

However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel. So instead of a hard coded IP address and port, a client supporting Sentinel should optionally be able to take as input:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A list of ip:port pairs pointing to known Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* The name of the service, like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"timelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the procedure a client should follow in order to obtain the master address starting from the list of Sentinels and the service name.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.0288,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/eval-review.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review > 数据格式设计\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"无论是否引入 Ragas，统一数据格式（兼容 Ragas 的 SingleTurnSample）:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ntest_case = {\\\\\\\\n    # 输入\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"user_input\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"READONLY You can\\'t write against a read only replica 怎么解决\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # 检索结果（从 Agent 日志提取）\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"retrieved_contexts\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换后...\\\\\\\\\\\\\",  # chunk text\\\\\\\\n    ],\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Agent 输出\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"response\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"根据文档，这个错误是 Redis Sentinel 主从切换导致的...\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Ground truth（手写）\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"reference\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"READONLY 错误是 Redis Sentinel failover 后，应用仍连接旧 master（已降为 replica）导致。解决方案：使用 Sentinel 客户端自动切换。\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # 元数据\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"expected_doc\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"redis-failover.md\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"source\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"local\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"exact\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n这个格式可以直接喂给:\\\\\\\\n- 我们的自建评估函数\\\\\\\\n- Ragas 的 `SingleTurnSample`\\\\\\\\n- 任何其他评测框架\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='根据检索结果，Redis 主从切换后客户端自动重连的方案如下：\\n\\n## 使用 Sentinel 客户端（推荐）\\n\\n如果应用使用 **Sentinel 客户端**（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会**自动切换**到新的 master，无需手动干预。\\n\\n**关键配置要求：**\\n\\n1. **客户端配置 Sentinel 地址**，而非直连 master IP\\n2. **开启连接池健康检查**：`testOnBorrow` 或等效配置\\n3. **等待 30 秒**，观察错误率是否自动下降\\n\\n**工作原理：**\\n- Sentinel 客户端会从 Sentinel 实例获取当前 master 地址\\n- 当 Sentinel 触发 failover 后，客户端会自动发现新 master 并重连\\n- 这是服务发现（service discovery）机制，客户端只需知道 Sentinel 地址和服务名（如 \"mymaster\"）\\n\\n## 直连 master IP 的情况（不推荐）\\n\\n如果应用**直连 master IP**，则需要手动处理：\\n\\n1. 获取新 master 地址：\\n```bash\\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n```\\n\\n2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\\n\\n3. 滚动重启应用：\\n```bash\\nkubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\\n```\\n\\n## 最佳实践\\n\\n- ✅ **所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP**\\n- ✅ 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\\n- ✅ 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\\n\\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 恢复操作 > 手动恢复]**  \\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md > Redis service discovery via Sentinel]**')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "根据检索结果，Redis 主从切换后客户端自动重连的方案如下：\n\n## 使用 Sentinel 客户端（推荐）\n\n如果应用使用 **Sentinel 客户端**（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会**自动切换**到新的 master，无需手动干预。\n\n**关键配置要求：**\n\n1. **客户端配置 Sentinel 地址**，而非直连 master IP\n2. **开启连接池健康检查**：`testOnBorrow` 或等效配置\n3. **等待 30 秒**，观察错误率是否自动下降\n\n**工作原理：**\n- Sentinel 客户端会从 Sentinel 实例获取当前 master 地址\n- 当 Sentinel 触发 failover 后，客户端会自动发现新 master 并重连\n- 这是服务发现（service discovery）机制，客户端只需知道 Sentinel 地址和服务名（如 \"mymaster\"）\n\n## 直连 master IP 的情况（不推荐）\n\n如果应用**直连 master IP**，则需要手动处理：\n\n1. 获取新 master 地址：\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n```\n\n2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\n\n3. 滚动重启应用：\n```bash\nkubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\n```\n\n## 最佳实践\n\n- ✅ **所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP**\n- ✅ 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\n- ✅ 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 恢复操作 > 手动恢复]**  \n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md > Redis service discovery via Sentinel]**", "session_id": "5b981f47-fd3d-4a6c-ac54-abb490c68980", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 94878, "total_cost_usd": 0.051282499999999995, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1224, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2450, "cache_read_input_tokens": 30650, "output_tokens": 581, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

At some point a single\\\\\\\\nbox may not be enough anyway, so if you want to use multiple CPUs you can\\\\\\\\nstart thinking of some way to shard earlier.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can find more information about using multiple Redis instances in the [Partitioning page]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs of version 4.0, Redis has started implementing threaded actions. For now this is limited to deleting objects in the background and blocking commands implemented via Redis modules. For subsequent releases, the plan is to make Redis more and more threaded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis can handle up to 2^32 keys, and was tested in practice to\\\\\\\\nhandle at least 250 million keys per instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery hash, list, set, and sorted set, can hold 2^32 elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn other words your limit is likely the available memory in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you use keys with limited time to live (Redis expires) this is normal behavior. This is what happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The primary generates an RDB file on the first synchronization with the replica.\\\\\\\\n* The RDB file will not include keys already expired in the primary but which are still in memory.\\\\\\\\n* These keys are still in the memory of the Redis primary, even if logically expired. They\\'ll be considered non-existent, and their memory will be reclaimed later, either incrementally or explicitly on access. While these keys are not logically part of the dataset, they are accounted for in the [`INFO`]() output and in the [`DBSIZE`]() command.\\\\\\\\n* When the replica reads the RDB file generated by the primary, this set of keys will not be loaded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of this, it\\'s common for users with many expired keys to see fewer keys in the replicas. However, logically, the primary and replica will have the same content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is an acronym that stands for **RE**mote **DI**ctionary **S**erver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSalvatore originally created Redis to scale [LLOOGG](https://github.com/antirez/lloogg), a real-time log analysis tool.

Check logs to confirm:**\n```bash\n# Current crash logs\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>\n\n# Previous crash logs (from before the restart)\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous\n```\n\n## Fix OOMKilled Issues\n\nIf the container is being killed due to memory limits, increase them:\n\n```yaml\nresources:\n  requests:\n    memory: \"256Mi\"\n  limits:\n    memory: \"512Mi\"\n```\n\n## Other Common Causes\n\nIf it's not OOMKilled, check for:\n- **Config errors**: Verify ConfigMap/Secret mounts and environment variables\n- **Liveness probe failures**: The probe might be too aggressive for slow-starting apps\n- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure required services are running\n- **Bad image**: Verify image tag and registry access\n\n[来源: docs/runbook/kubernetes-pod-crashloop.md > Kubernetes Pod CrashLoopBackOff Troubleshooting Guide > Diagnostic Steps > 4.

使用**异步复制**机制。当主节点接收写命令后，会几乎同时做两件事：\n1. 向客户端返回响应\n2. 将命令复制到从节点\n\n虽然这两个操作时间窗口很小，但仍存在主节点已响应客户端、但数据还未复制到从节点就宕机的情况，此时会丢失这部分写入。\n\n根据 Redis 官方测试数据：在一次 failover 中，系统无法接受 578 次读和 577 次写，但**没有产生数据不一致**。\n\n## 如何保证数据一致性？\n\n### 1. 使用 Sentinel 客户端（必须）\n\n```\n禁止直连 master IP，必须使用 Sentinel 客户端\n```\n\n- 使用 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel 等客户端\n- 配置 Sentinel 地址而非 master 地址\n- 客户端会自动发现新 master 并切换连接\n\n### 2. 连接池配置\n\n```\nminEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000\ntestOnBorrow=true\n```\n\n确保连接池能及时检测并剔除失效连接。\n\n### 3. 定期演练 failover\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster\n```\n\n通过定期演练验证应用的容错能力。\n\n### 4. 监控关键指标\n\n- 监控 Sentinel 日志中的 `+switch-master` 事件\n- 监控应用日志中的 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\n- 监控 Redis 写入延迟\n\n## 故障恢复流程\n\n如果应用使用 Sentinel 客户端：\n1. 连接会自动切换到新 master\n2. 等待 30 秒观察错误率下降\n\n如果应用直连 master IP（不推荐）：\n1. 获取新 master：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\n2. 更新应用配置\n3.

do (that is also\\\\\\\\nthe semantically simplest failure that can occur in a distributed system)\\\\\\\\nis to crash a single process, in our case a single master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nDuring this test, you should take a tab open with the consistency test\\\\\\\\napplication running.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can identify a master and crash it with the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes | grep master\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385482984082 0 connected

This may\\\\\\\\nsound unexpected as in the first part of this tutorial we stated that Redis\\\\\\\\nCluster can lose writes during the failover because it uses asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication. What we did not say is that this is not very likely to happen\\\\\\\\nbecause Redis sends the reply to the client, and the commands to replicate\\\\\\\\nto the replicas, about at the same time, so there is a very small window to\\\\\\\\nlose data. However the fact that it is hard to trigger does not mean that it\\\\\\\\nis impossible, so this does not change the consistency guarantees provided\\\\\\\\nby Redis cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can now check what is the cluster setup after the failover (note that\\\\\\\\nin the meantime I restarted the crashed instance so that it rejoins the\\\\\\\\ncluster as a replica):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes\\\\\\\\n3fc783611028b1707fd65345e763befb36454d73 127.0.0.1:7004 slave 3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 0 1385503418521 0 connected\\\\\\\\na211e242fc6b22a9427fed61285e85892fa04e08 127.0.0.1:7003 slave 97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 0 1385503419023 0 connected\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 127.0.0.1:7005 master - 0 1385503419023 3 connected 11423-16383\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385503417005 0 connected 5960-10921\\\\\\\\n2938205e12de373867bf38f1ca29d31d0ddb3e46 127.0.0.1:7002 slave 3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 0 1385503418016 3 connected\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow the masters are running on ports 7000, 7001 and 7005.

propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"An important part of Redis Cluster is the mechanism used to propagate the information about which cluster node is serving a given set of hash slots. This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.7326,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"227377d9\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"227377d9-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/multi-key-operations.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Multi-key operations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Pipelines, transactions, and scripts\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"| Behavior | Commands |\\\\\\\\n|----------|----------|\\\\\\\\n| **ROS/RS clustering disabled:**<br>&ndash; the whole DB (single shard)<br><br>**ROS clustering enabled, RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API enabled):**<br>&ndash; the current shard<br><br>**RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API disabled):**<br>&ndash; all shards | FLUSHALL, FLUSHDB |\\\\\\\\n| **ROS/RS clustering disabled:**<br>&ndash; cross-slot<br><br>**ROS clustering enabled, RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API enabled):**<br>&ndash; single-slot<br><br>**RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API disabled):**<br>&ndash; cross-slot (all shards) | DEL, MSET, TOUCH, UNLINK<br><br>Note: on Active-Active, DEL, MSET, and UNLINK are single-slot |\\\\\\\\n| **ROS/RS clustering disabled:**<br>&ndash; cross-slot<br><br>**ROS clustering enabled, RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API enabled), RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API disabled):**<br>&ndash; single-slot | BITOP, BLMOVE, BLMPOP, BLPOP, BRPOP, BRPOPLPUSH, BZMPOP, BZPOPMAX, BZPOPMIN, CMS.MERGE, COPY, GEORADIUS or GEORADIUSBYMEMBER (with STORE or STOREDIST), GEOSEARCHSTORE, JSON.MSET, LMOVE, LMPOP, MSETNX, PFMERGE, RENAME, RENAMENX, RPOPLPUSH, SDIFFSTORE, SINTERSTORE, SMOVE, SUNIONSTORE, TDIGEST.MERGE, TS.MADD, ZDIFFSTORE, ZINTERSTORE, ZMPOP, ZRANGESTORE, ZUNIONSTORE |\\\\\\\\n| **ROS/RS clustering disabled:**<br>&ndash; cross-slot<br><br>**ROS clustering enabled, RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API enabled), RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API disabled):**<br>&ndash; single-shard | TS.CREATERULE, TS.DELETERULE<br><br>Users won\\'t get a CROSSSLOT error.

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis server 7.2 introduces significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets, several improvements, including encoding improvements for sets and lists, stream consumer group improvements, and improved durability.\\\\\\\\nSearch and Query brings the frequently asked Geo polygons queries for basic shapes and improved query performance on sorting in different scenarios. \\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands: [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) and [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) for more efficient data manipulation.\\\\\\\\nPreview of triggers and functions that allows developers to run JavaScript functions inside the Redis process.\\\\\\\\nLastly, 7.2 adds the option to use the new protocol [RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) improving the response format for all commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis server**:\\\\\\\\nRedis server 7.2 brings performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process. These functions can be executed on-demand, by an event-driven trigger, or by a stream processing trigger. Triggers and functions empowers developers to build and maintain real-time applications by moving logic closer to the data, ensuring a lower latency whilst delivering the best developer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry it out with the [triggers and functions quick start](https://redis.io/docs/interact/programmability/triggers-and-functions/quick_start/).\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.6767,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e37f9728\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e37f9728-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/ai_Self-Evolving_agent/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Create a new conda environment\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🎯 Roadmap\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"We use our framework to optimize existing multi-agent systems on the [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) benchmark.

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

`data` argument which pass to the stream consumer callback are in the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"<ms>\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<seq>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<stream name>\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n

],\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why the record is a list of touples and not an object is because the Redis Stream specifications allows duplicate keys.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotice that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS` `ArrayBuffer`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can observe the streams which are tracked by our registered consumer using `TFUNCTION LIST` command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFUNCTION LIST

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When new `configEpoch` values are created via replica promotion during\\\\\\\\nfailovers, they are guaranteed to be unique.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever there are two distinct events where new configEpoch values are\\\\\\\\ncreated in an unsafe way, just incrementing the local `currentEpoch` of\\\\\\\\nthe local node and hoping there are no conflicts at the same time.\\\\\\\\nBoth the events are system-administrator triggered:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover) command with `TAKEOVER` option is able to manually promote a replica node into a master *without the majority of masters being available*. This is useful, for example, in multi data center setups.\\\\\\\\n2. Migration of slots for cluster rebalancing also generates new configuration epochs inside the local node without agreement for performance reasons.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, during manual resharding, when a hash slot is migrated from\\\\\\\\na node A to a node B, the resharding program will force B to upgrade\\\\\\\\nits configuration to an epoch which is the greatest found in the cluster,\\\\\\\\nplus 1 (unless the node is already the one with the greatest configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch), without requiring agreement from other nodes.\\\\\\\\nUsually a real world resharding involves moving several hundred hash slots\\\\\\\\n(especially in small clusters). Requiring an agreement to generate new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration epochs during resharding, for each hash slot moved, is\\\\\\\\ninefficient. Moreover it requires a fsync in each of the cluster nodes\\\\\\\\nevery time in order to store the new configuration. Because of the way it is\\\\\\\\nperformed instead, we only need a new config epoch when the first hash slot is moved,\\\\\\\\nmaking it much more efficient in production environments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever because of the two cases above, it is possible (though unlikely) to end\\\\\\\\nwith multiple nodes having the same configuration epoch. A resharding operation\\\\\\\\nperformed by the system administrator, and a failover happening at the same\\\\\\\\ntime (plus a lot of bad luck) could cause `currentEpoch` collisions if\\\\\\\\nthey are not propagated fast enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, software bugs and filesystem corruptions can also contribute\\\\\\\\nto multiple nodes having the same configuration epoch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen masters serving different hash slots have the same `configEpoch`, there\\\\\\\\nare no issues. It is more important that replicas failing over a master have\\\\\\\\nunique configuration epochs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat said, manual interventions or resharding may change the cluster\\\\\\\\nconfiguration in different ways. The Redis Cluster main liveness property\\\\\\\\nrequires that slot configurations always converge, so under every circumstance\\\\\\\\nwe really want all the master nodes to have a different `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to enforce this, **a conflict resolution algorithm** is used in the\\\\\\\\nevent that two nodes end up with the same `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* IF a master node detects another master node is advertising itself with\\\\\\\\nthe same `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n* AND IF the node has a lexicographically smaller Node ID compared to the other node claiming the same `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n* THEN it increments its `currentEpoch` by 1, and uses it as the new `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf there are any set of nodes with the same `configEpoch`, all the nodes but the one with the greatest Node ID will move forward, guaranteeing that, eventually, every node will pick a unique configEpoch regardless of what happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism also guarantees that after a fresh cluster is created, all\\\\\\\\nnodes start with a different `configEpoch` (even if this is not actually\\\\\\\\nused) since `redis-cli` makes sure to use [`CLUSTER SET-CONFIG-EPOCH`](/commands/cluster-set-config-epoch) at startup.\\\\\\\\nHowever if for some reason a node is left misconfigured, it will update\\\\\\\\nits configuration to a different configuration epoch automatically.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.9191,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"See also\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis vector sets are efficient, but vector similarity indexing and graph traversal require memory tradeoffs.

Some applications may require that all queries be served in less than 1 millisecond. For other applications, it may be acceptable for a small amount of clients to experience a 2 second latency on occasion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step to enable the latency monitor is to set a **latency threshold** in milliseconds. Only events that take longer than the specified threshold will be logged as latency spikes. The user should set the threshold according to their needs. For example, if the application requires a maximum acceptable latency of 100 milliseconds, the threshold should be set to log all the events blocking the server for a time equal or greater to 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEnable the latency monitor at runtime in a production server\\\\\\\\nwith the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMonitoring is turned off by default (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. While the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe user interface to the latency monitoring subsystem is the [`LATENCY`](/commands/latency) command.\\\\\\\\nLike many other Redis commands, [`LATENCY`](/commands/latency) accepts subcommands that modify its behavior.

When a JSON document is indexed, the value extracted by the JSONPath query is indexed in the given field.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n _This features require the module [RedisJSON 2.0](https://www.redisjson.io) to be installed._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the new `FT.PROFILE` command, it is now possible to profile in detail the execution time of several internal steps involved in the execution of `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE`.\\\\\\\\nThat way, it is possible to understand which part of the query is taking most of the resources.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the support of JSON document indexing, it is now possible to map a JSONPath query to an alias. Therefore, it is possible to index the same value in different indexing attributes with different indexing strategies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs of RediSearch v2.2, index `fields` are now known as `attributes` in order to avoid confusion with hash fields. This change impacts the `FT.INFO` command\\'s response, which might break clients.  It is advised to upgrade your application to the latest supported Redis clients prior to upgrading to RediSearch 2.2.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.31,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"design-review-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"design-review-002-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/design-review.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 系统设计 Review v2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 系统设计 Review v2 > 当前架构 > 已验证的数据\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"| 组件 | 文件 | 行数 | 状态 |\\\\\\\\n|------|------|------|------|\\\\\\\\n| MCP Server | `scripts/mcp_server.py` | 198 | ✅ hybrid_search + keyword_search + index_status |\\\\\\\\n| 索引工具 | `scripts/index.py` | ~500 | ✅ heading-based chunking + section_path + delete_by_source_repo |\\\\\\\\n| 评估模块 | `scripts/eval_module.py` | 335 | ✅ extract_contexts + gate_check + llm_judge |\\\\\\\\n| 检索 Skill | `.claude/skills/search/` | ~270 | ✅ Agentic Router 策略 |\\\\\\\\n| 仓库导入 Skill | `.claude/skills/ingest-repo/` | ~160 | ✅ clone → 提取 → 溯源 front-matter → 索引 |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| 指标 | 结果 |\\\\\\\\n|------|------|\\\\\\\\n| Hybrid vs Dense-only | +36% 准确率 |\\\\\\\\n| Layer 1 本地文档 (Grep) | 17/17 (100%) |\\\\\\\\n| Layer 2 Qdrant (USE_MCP=1) | 37/41 (90%) |\\\\\\\\n| Notfound 防幻觉 | 6/6 (100%) |\\\\\\\\n| 总体 (USE_MCP=1) | 60/64 (93.8%) |\\\\\\\\n| 跨语言 | 英文问→中文文档 ✅，中文问→英文文档 ✅ |\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.0649,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7b321ff7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7b321ff7-005\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisearch/redisearch-2.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisearch 2.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v2.0.0 (September 2020) > Noteworthy changes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- [#1246](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/1246): `geodistance` function for `FT.AGGREGATE` APPLY operation.\\\\\\\\n- [#1394](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/1394): Expired documents (TTL) will be removed from the index.\\\\\\\\n- [#1394](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/1394): Optimization to avoid reindexing documents when non-indexed fields are updated.\\\\\\\\n- After index creation, an initial scan starts for existing documents.  You can check the status of this scan by calling `FT.INFO` and looking at the `indexing` and `percent_indexed` values.  While `indexing` is true, queries return partial results.\\\\\\\\n- [#1435](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/1435): `NOINITIALINDEX` flag on `FT.CREATE` to skip the initial scan of documents on index creation.\\\\\\\\n- [#1401](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/1401): Support upgrade from v1.x and for reading RDB\\'s created by RediSearch 1.x.\\\\\\\\n- [#1445](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/1445): Support for load event.

To support this, we\\'ve\\\\\\\\nmade a few changes to the API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition to simplifying indexing, RediSearch 2.0 allows you to scale a single index over multiple Redis shards using the Redis cluster API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, RediSearch 2.x keeps its indexes outside of the main Redis key space. Improvements to the indexing code have increased query performance 2.4x.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can read more details in [the RediSearch 2.0 announcement blog post](https://redislabs.com/blog/introducing-redisearch-2-0/), and you can get started by checking out this [quick start blog post](https://redislabs.com/blog/getting-started-with-redisearch-2-0/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- When you create an index, you must specify a prefix condition and/or a filter. This determines which hashes RediSearch will index.\\\\\\\\n- Several RediSearch commands now map to their Redis equivalents: `FT.ADD` -> `HSET`, `FT.DEL` -> `DEL` (equivalent to `FT.DEL` with the DD flag in RediSearch 1.x), `FT.GET` -> `HGETALL`, `FT.MGET` -> `HGETALL`.\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch indexes no longer reside within the key space, and the indexes are no longer saved to the RDB.\\\\\\\\n- You can upgrade from RediSearch 1.x to RediSearch 2.x.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='❌ 未找到相关文档。\\n\\n知识库中没有关于 Elasticsearch index mapping 设计的文档。检索结果主要是 RediSearch（Redis 的搜索模块）和本项目的设计文档，与 Elasticsearch 无关。\\n\\n如果你需要了解 Elasticsearch mapping 设计，建议：\\n1. 导入 Elasticsearch 官方文档到知识库\\n2. 或者我可以基于通用知识回答（但不符合知识库检索的防幻觉约束）')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "❌ 未找到相关文档。\n\n知识库中没有关于 Elasticsearch index mapping 设计的文档。检索结果主要是 RediSearch（Redis 的搜索模块）和本项目的设计文档，与 Elasticsearch 无关。\n\n如果你需要了解 Elasticsearch mapping 设计，建议：\n1. 导入 Elasticsearch 官方文档到知识库\n2. 或者我可以基于通用知识回答（但不符合知识库检索的防幻觉约束）", "session_id": "50aaa84a-53ae-4962-a821-bba2da272357", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 138419, "total_cost_usd": 0.04446875, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1346, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2693, "cache_read_input_tokens": 33665, "output_tokens": 163, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

It allows for storage of vector embeddings and facilitates fast similarity searches, crucial for retrieving relevant information in RAG.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Popular AI frameworks**: Redis integrates seamlessly with various AI frameworks and tools. For instance, combining Redis with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) or [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/RedisIndexDemo/), libraries for building language models, enables developers to create sophisticated RAG pipelines. These integrations support efficient data management and building real-time LLM chains.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Spring AI and Redis**: Using [Spring AI with Redis](https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/) simplifies building RAG applications. Spring AI provides a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into applications, while Redis handles data management, ensuring the RAG pipeline is efficient and scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Embed and store data**: Convert your data into vector embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., BERT, GPT). Store these embeddings in Redis, where they can be quickly retrieved based on vector searches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Integrate with a generative model**: Use a generative AI model that can leverage the retrieved data. The model will use the vectors stored in Redis to augment its generation process, ensuring the output is informed by relevant, up-to-date information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Query and generate**: Implement the query logic to retrieve relevant vectors from Redis based on the input prompt. Feed these vectors into the generative model to produce augmented outputs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency**: The in-memory data store of Redis ensures that retrieval operations are performed with minimal latency.\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability**: Redis scales horizontally, seamlessly handling growing volumes of data and queries.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures and integrates with AI frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, Redis offers a powerful and efficient platform for implementing RAG. Its vector management capabilities, high performance, and seamless integration with AI frameworks make it an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI applications with real-time data retrieval.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -8.5106,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6a7aea0e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6a7aea0e-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_services_agency/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"AI Services Agency 👨\\u200d💼\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"AI Services Agency 👨\\u200d💼 > How to Run\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:\\\\\\\\nBefore anything else, Please get your OpenAI API Key here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Clone the Repository**:\\\\\\\\n   ```bash\\\\\\\\n   git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\\\\\\\\n   cd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_services_agency\\\\\\\\n   ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Install the dependencies**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Run the Streamlit app**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    streamlit run agency.py\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Enter your OpenAI API Key** in the sidebar when prompted and start analyzing your startup idea!\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -9.5646,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6224b31\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6224b31-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/multimodal_ai_agent/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Readme\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🧬 Multimodal AI Agent\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Streamlit application that combines video analysis and web search capabilities using Google\\'s Gemini 2.5 model.

You can migrate shards to restart them. Newly created databases can skip this step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Use [`rladmin status shards db <db-name>`]() to list all shards for your database:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ```sh\\\\\\\\n    rladmin status shards db db-name\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Example output:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ```sh\\\\\\\\n    SHARDS:\\\\\\\\n    DB:ID   NAME                ID      NODE   ROLE   SLOTS   USED_MEMORY STATUS\\\\\\\\n    db:2    db-name             redis:1 node:1 master 0-16383 1.95MB      OK    \\\\\\\\n    db:2    db-name             redis:2 node:2 slave  0-16383 1.95MB      OK    \\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Note the following fields for the next steps: \\\\\\\\n    - `ID`: the Redis shard\\'s ID.\\\\\\\\n    - `NODE`: the node on which the shard currently resides.\\\\\\\\n    - `ROLE`: `master` is a primary shard; `slave` is a replica shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. For each replica shard, use [`rladmin migrate shard`]() to move it to a different node and restart it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ```sh\\\\\\\\n    rladmin migrate shard <shard_id> target_node <node_id>\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. After you migrate the replica shards, migrate the original primary shards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

\\\\\"Commands accepting a glob-style pattern, including [`KEYS`](/commands/keys), [`SCAN`](/commands/scan) and [`SORT`](/commands/sort), are optimized for patterns that imply a single slot.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if all keys that can match a pattern must belong to a specific slot, only this slot is searched for keys matching the pattern.\\\\\\\\nThe pattern slot optimization is introduced in Redis 8.0.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe optimization kicks in when the pattern meets the following conditions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* the pattern contains a hashtag,\\\\\\\\n* there are no wildcards or escape characters before the hashtag, and\\\\\\\\n* the hashtag within curly braces doesn\\'t contain any wildcards or escape characters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, `SCAN 0 MATCH {abc}*` can successfully recognize the hashtag and scans only the slot corresponding to `abc`.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the patterns `*{abc}`, `{a*c}`, or `{a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*bc}` cannot recognize the hashtag, so all slots need to be scanned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding the hash tags exception, the following is an implementation of the `HASH_SLOT` function in Ruby and C language.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRuby example
