\\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis sorted set is a collection of unique strings (members) ordered by an associated score.\\\\\\\\nWhen more than one string has the same score, the strings are ordered lexicographically.\\\\\\\\nSome use cases for sorted sets include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Leaderboards. For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"agent_hint\\\\\": \\\\\"[overview | gaps:incomplete_steps,missing_example]\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"evidence_flags\\\\\": {\\\\n      \\\\\"has_command\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_config\\\\\": true,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_code_block\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_steps\\\\\": false\\\\n    }\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.345,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-053\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 53,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"../my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Key API for Sorted Set iterator > `RedisModule_ZsetRangePrev`\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"int RedisModule_ZsetLastInLexRange(RedisModuleKey *key,\\\\\\\\n                                       RedisModuleString *min,\\\\\\\\n                                       RedisModuleString *max);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 4.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExactly like [`RedisModule_ZsetFirstInLexRange()`](#RedisModule_ZsetFirstInLexRange) but the last element of\\\\\\\\nthe range is selected for the start of the iteration instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<span id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"RedisModule_ZsetRangeCurrentElement\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisModuleString *RedisModule_ZsetRangeCurrentElement(RedisModuleKey *key,\\\\\\\\n                                                           double *score);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 4.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReturn the current sorted set element of an active sorted set iterator\\\\\\\\nor NULL if the range specified in the iterator does not include any\\\\\\\\nelement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<span id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"RedisModule_ZsetRangeNext\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nint RedisModule_ZsetRangeNext(RedisModuleKey *key);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 4.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGo to the next element of the sorted set iterator.

It has made key strides in the development of wind turbines and energy-efficient software.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.3758,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d166f57\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d166f57-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/8d166f57.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"S&P 500 stocks: 5 companies now make up 18% of the index.

This massive growth also means these companies now have an outsized impact on the performance of the market itself. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, these 5 tech stocks were responsible for more than 20% of the S&P 500’s 31% return in 2019. When you see a handful of stocks dominate in such a way it can make some investors nervous. What happens to the stock market if these companies begin to sell off? Is the rest of the market participating in this rally or is it all being driven by just a small number of stocks? One of the things that jumps out from this list is how high the turnover at the top can be. Every decade there were at least five to six new names at the top of the list. While technology firms dominate the top slots today, in the early-1980s it was energy companies. The behemoth tech stocks have taken advantage of these trends but it was not preordained that these companies would be where they are today. Apple was rescued by Microsoft with a $150 million loan in 1997 which was one year before Google was founded. Jeff Bezos started Amazon in a garage in 1994.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.4823,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6db497de\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

It was officially introduced on March 4, 1957 by Standard & Poor. McGraw-Hill acquired it in 1966. The S&P Dow Jones Indices owns it as of 2022 and that\\'s a joint venture between S&P Global (formerly) McGraw Hill Financial, CME Group, and News Corp, the owner of Dow Jones. It tracks 500 publicly traded, large-cap U.S. companies. These businesses must meet specific criteria to be a part of the S&P 500. The mix of industries that make up the S&P 500 list often reflects the economic makeup of the United States. The S&P 500 tracks the market capitalization of the companies in its index. Market cap is the total value of all shares of stock that a company has issued. It\\'s calculated by multiplying the number of shares issued by the stock price. A company that has a market cap of $100 billion receives 10 times the representation as a company whose market cap is $10 billion. It represents the stock market\\'s performance by reporting the risks and returns of the biggest companies. Investors use it as the benchmark of the overall market, to which all other investments are compared.

Additionally, while PepsiCo’s revenues have steadily increased during the 2016-2019 period, Coca-Cola’s revenues have declined during this period due to refranchising of its bottling operations (franchise owners record revenues from bottling plants they own, while Coca-Cola earns fees from franchisees), with some revenue growth coming only in FY2019 with most refranchising already done.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.9977,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a54493c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a54493c-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/0a54493c.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc - ADR Shares Close the Day 11.0% Higher - Daily Wrap ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc - ADR Shares Close the Day 11.0% Higher - Daily Wrap ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"XPeng Inc - ADR (XPEV) shares closed today 11.0% higher than it did at the end of yesterday.

Since it represents the “market” value of a company, it is computed based on the current market price (CMP) of its shares and the total number of outstanding shares. Since capitalization represents a dollar value that can vary widely, different buckets and associated nomenclatures exist for categorizing the different market cap ranges. Below are the commonly used standards for each capitalization. Companies that are considered micro-cap consist mostly of penny stocks—this category denotes companies with market capitalizations between $50 million to $300 million. For instance, a lesser-known pharma company with no marketable product and working on developing a drug for an incurable disease, or a five-person company working on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered robotics technology may be listed with a small valuation and limited trading activity. Companies may be categorized as large-, mid-, or small-cap depending on their market capitalization. Blue-chip companies are often large- or mega-cap stocks, while the very smallest are referred to as micro-caps. Market cap is calculated by multiplying a company\\'s outstanding shares by the current market price of one share.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.0849,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8c9cde5e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8c9cde5e-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/8c9cde5e.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"CURO Group Holdings Stock Price | CURO Stock Quote, News, and History ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"CURO Group Holdings Stock Price | CURO Stock Quote, News, and History ...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"What was the 52-week low for CURO Group Holdings stock?

According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, these 5 tech stocks were responsible for more than 20% of the S&P 500’s 31% return in 2019. When you see a handful of stocks dominate in such a way it can make some investors nervous. What happens to the stock market if these companies begin to sell off? Is the rest of the market participating in this rally or is it all being driven by just a small number of stocks? One of the things that jumps out from this list is how high the turnover at the top can be. Every decade there were at least five to six new names at the top of the list. While technology firms dominate the top slots today, in the early-1980s it was energy companies. The behemoth tech stocks have taken advantage of these trends but it was not preordained that these companies would be where they are today. Apple was rescued by Microsoft with a $150 million loan in 1997 which was one year before Google was founded. Jeff Bezos started Amazon in a garage in 1994.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.6037,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"61e7db98\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"61e7db98-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/61e7db98.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Todays High: What It Is, How It Works, Example\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Today\\'s High: What It Is, How It Works, Example\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Today&#x27;s high refers to a security&#x27;s intraday high trading price or the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the day.This can be contrasted with today\\'s low, which is the trading day\\'s intraday low price. Today\\'s high provides information to traders and investors on a stock\\'s price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock\\'s price might be. Today\\'s high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today\\'s high, along with today\\'s low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock\\'s price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade.

Dicks Sporting\\'s Price to Sales ratio is typically used for valuing equity relative to its own past performance as well as to performance of other companies or market indexes. In most cases, the lower the ratio, the better it is for investors. However, it is advisable for investors to exercise caution when looking at price-to-sales ratios across different industries. Consistent increases or drops in fundamental ratios usually indicate a possible pattern that can be successfully translated into profits. However, when comparing two companies, knowing each company\\'s price to sales growth rates may not be enough to decide which company is a better investment.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.1061,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"45eb8405\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"45eb8405-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 2,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/crag-finance/45eb8405.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"NYSE Equity Daily Volumes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Daily U.S Equity Matched Volumes (millions) > ### includes CS2 until January 31, 2024 > ICE\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* [Our Business](https://www.ice.com/about)\\\\\\\\n* [Investors](https://ir.theice.com/home/default.aspx)\\\\\\\\n* [Media Center](https://www.ice.com/media)\\\\\\\\n* [Careers](https://www.ice.com/careers)\\\\\\\\n* [Corporate Citizenship](https://www.ice.com/about/corporate-responsibility)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [List](/listings)\\\\\\\\n* [Trade](/trade)\\\\\\\\n* [Data](/trading-data)\\\\\\\\n* [Insights](/research)\\\\\\\\n* [Regulation](/regulation)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Subscriptions](/subscriptions)\\\\\\\\n* [Bell & Photography Information](/media)\\\\\\\\n* [NYSE Contact](/contact)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Exchanges](https://www.ice.com/about/exchanges-clearing)\\\\\\\\n* [Fixed Income & Data Services](https://www.ice.com/about/fixed-income-data)\\\\\\\\n* [Mortgage Technology](https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/)\\\\\\\\n* [Futures & Options](https://www.ice.com/products)\\\\\\\\n* [Trade](https://www.ice.com/trade)\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n[SEARCH NOTE] 以上为文档片段（chunks），可能不完整。如果 chunk 内容不足以完整回答问题（缺少具体步骤、命令、配置、代码），请用 Read(path) 读取对应文件获取完整上下文，严禁用通用知识补充。\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='API Error: 429 已达到周费用限制 ($280)且加油包已用完')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "API Error: 429 已达到周费用限制 ($280)且加油包已用完", "session_id": "3c2b33ca-3f4e-442c-911e-fb039802d5df", "num_turns": 2, "duration_ms": 1072097, "total_cost_usd": 0.00957175, "usage": {"input_tokens": 306, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 613, "cache_read_input_tokens": 7671, "output_tokens": 15, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}
