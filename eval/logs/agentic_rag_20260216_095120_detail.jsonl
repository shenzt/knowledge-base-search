For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3277,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis set is an unordered collection of unique strings (members).\\\\\\\\nYou can use Redis sets to efficiently:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Track unique items (e.g., track all unique IP addresses accessing a given blog post).\\\\\\\\n* Represent relations (e.g., the set of all users with a given role).\\\\\\\\n* Perform common set operations such as intersection, unions, and differences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`SADD`]() adds a new member to a set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SREM`]() removes the specified member from the set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SISMEMBER`]() tests a string for set membership.\\\\\\\\n* [`SINTER`]() returns the set of members that two or more sets have in common (i.e., the intersection).\\\\\\\\n* [`SCARD`]() returns the size (a.k.a. cardinality) of a set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of set commands](?group=set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Store the sets of bikes racing in France and the USA.

For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6694,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Learn more\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* There are two ways we can use a sorted set to represent a leaderboard.

Complete Worker Pattern\n\n```ruby\n# Pseudocode for a reliable worker\nconsumer_name = \"worker-1\"\ngroup_name = \"workers\"\n\nloop do\n  # First, check for pending messages (recovery from crash)\n  messages = XREADGROUP GROUP workers worker-1 STREAMS myqueue 0\n  \n  if messages.empty?\n    # No pending messages, get new ones\n    messages = XREADGROUP GROUP workers worker-1 BLOCK 2000 COUNT 10 STREAMS myqueue >\n  end\n  \n  messages.each do |msg|\n    process_message(msg)\n    XACK myqueue workers msg.id\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### 5. Handling Failed Messages\n\n**Check pending messages:**\n```bash\nXPENDING myqueue workers\n```\n\n**Claim messages from failed workers:**\n```bash\n# Claim messages idle for 60+ seconds\nXAUTOCLAIM myqueue workers worker-2 60000 0-0 COUNT 10\n```\n\n### Key Features for Message Queuing\n\n- **Load balancing**: Multiple consumers automatically get different messages\n- **At-least-once delivery**: Messages stay pending until acknowledged\n- **Failure recovery**: Claim idle messages from crashed workers\n- **Message history**: All messages retained (unless trimmed)\n- **Observability**: `XINFO` and `XPENDING` for monitoring\n\n### Capping Stream Size\n\n```bash\n# Keep only last 10,000 messages\nXADD myqueue MAXLEN ~ 10000 * task \"new-task\"\n\n# Or trim separately\nXTRIM myqueue MAXLEN ~ 10000\n```\n\n[Source: /home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/tests/fixtures/kb-sources/redis-docs/content/develop/data-types/streams/_index.md]", "tools_used": ["Read", "Grep",

Request/Response server can be implemented so that it is able to process new requests even if the client hasn\\'t already read the old responses.\\\\\\\\nThis way it is possible to send *multiple commands* to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use for many decades.\\\\\\\\nFor instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has supported pipelining since its early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.\\\\\\\\nThis is an example using the raw netcat utility:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash \\\\\\\\n$ (printf \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; sleep 1) | nc localhost 6379\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time we don\\'t pay the cost of RTT for every call, but just once for the three commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be explicit, with pipelining the order of operations of our very first example will be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the client sends commands using pipelining, the server will be forced to queue the replies, using memory. So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.0149,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/streams/idempotency.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotent message processing\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotency modes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when using at-least-once delivery patterns. This feature enables reliable message submission with automatic deduplication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdempotent message processing ensures that handling the same message multiple times produces the same system state as handling it once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeginning with Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when producers resend messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProducers may need to resend messages under two scenarios:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producer-Redis network issues (disconnection and reconnection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If a disconnection occurs after the producer executes `XADD`, but before it receives the reply, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The producer crashes and restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If the producer crashes after calling `XADD` but before receiving the reply and marking a message as delivered, after a restart, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases, to guarantee that the message is added to the stream, the producer must call `XADD` again with the same message. Without idempotent message processing, a retry may result in a message being delivered twice. With idempotent message processing, producers can guarantee at-most-once production even under such scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA unique ID, called an idempotent ID or *iid*, is associated with each message that is added to a stream. \\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to assign iids:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producers provide a unique iid for each message. An iid can be some identifier already associated with this message: a transaction ID, a counter, or a UUID.\\\\\\\\n1. Redis generates an iid based on each message’s content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the same message is added to the stream more than once, the same iid would need to be provided by the producer.\\\\\\\\nFor (1), this is the producer’s responsibility, and for (2), Redis will calculate the same iid, as long as the message content hasn’t changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the [`XADD`]() command with idempotency parameters, `IDMP` or `IDMPAUTO`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # producer-1 (pid) and iid-1 (iid) are provided manually\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value        # producer-2 (pid) is provided manually, Redis provides the iid\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.0844,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/streams/idempotency.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotent message processing\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotency modes > Automatic mode (`IDMPAUTO`)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Specify both producer ID (pid) and iid explicitly:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer1 msg1 * field value\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `pid`: Unique identifier for the message producer.\\\\\\\\n- `iid`: Unique identifier for a specific message.\\\\\\\\n- Performance: Faster processing (no hash calculation).\\\\\\\\n- Control: Full control over ID generation and uniqueness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecify only the pid;

With Streams, you can create a [capped stream](, effectively limiting the number of messages by count. In RedisTimeSeries, you can apply a retention policy in milliseconds. This is better for time series use cases, because they are typically interested in the data during a given time window, rather than a fixed number of samples.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n

pushing\\\\\\\\nelements, or removing empty lists when they no longer have elements inside.\\\\\\\\nIt is Redis\\' responsibility to delete keys when lists are left empty, or to create\\\\\\\\nan empty list if the key does not exist and we are trying to add elements\\\\\\\\nto it, for example, with [`LPUSH`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is not specific to lists, it applies to all the Redis data types\\\\\\\\ncomposed of multiple elements -- Streams, Sets, Sorted Sets and Hashes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically we can summarize the behavior with three rules:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. When we add an element to an aggregate data type, if the target key does not exist, an empty aggregate data type is created before adding the element.\\\\\\\\n2. When we remove elements from an aggregate data type, if the value remains empty, the key is automatically destroyed. The Stream data type is the only exception to this rule.\\\\\\\\n3. Calling a read-only command such as [`LLEN`]() (which returns the length of the list), or a write command removing elements, with an empty key, always produces the same result as if the key is holding an empty aggregate type of the type the command expects to find.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExamples of rule 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL new_bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> LPUSH new_bikes bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever we can\\'t perform operations against the wrong type if the key exists:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL new_bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SET new_bikes bike:1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> TYPE new_bikes\\\\\\\\nstring\\\\\\\\n> LPUSH new_bikes bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample of rule 2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> LPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> EXISTS bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> LPOP bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> LPOP bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> LPOP bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> EXISTS bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe key no longer exists after all the elements are popped.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample of rule 3:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> LLEN bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> LPOP bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(nil)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe maximum length of a Redis list is 2^32 - 1 (4,294,967,295) elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nList operations that access its head or tail are O(1), which means they\\'re highly efficient.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands that manipulate elements within a list are usually O(n).\\\\\\\\nExamples of these include [`LINDEX`](), [`LINSERT`](), and [`LSET`]().\\\\\\\\nExercise caution when running these commands, mainly when operating on large lists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConsider [Redis streams]() as an alternative to lists when you need to store and process an indeterminate series of events.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Redis Lists Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB5SeOkkxQc) is a short, comprehensive video explainer on Redis lists.\\\\\\\\n* [Redis University\\'s RU101](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/) covers Redis lists in detail.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Let me search more specifically for Redis Streams documentation with commands and usage examples.')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_dVq1gKeyvETLa27oXr64gU', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'streams data type append read consumer', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_LaVFsj4aF6oyuWU5n47m9E', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'context': 3, 'pattern': 'streams.*sequence.*entries'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_dVq1gKeyvETLa27oXr64gU', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.0157,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Compare data types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Data type features > Streams\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"-   **Structure**: sequence of entries, each with a set of field-value pairs.\\\\\\\\n-   **Operations**: add, read, trim.\\\\\\\\n-   **Suitable for**: Log data, time series, and other append-only structures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStreams store sequences of entries, each with a set of field-value pairs.\\\\\\\\nThey are optimized for appending new entries and reading them in order,\\\\\\\\nand so they are useful for implementing log data, time series, and other\\\\\\\\nappend-only data structures.

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

],\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why the record is a list of touples and not an object is because the Redis Stream specifications allows duplicate keys.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotice that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS` `ArrayBuffer`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can observe the streams which are tracked by our registered consumer using `TFUNCTION LIST` command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFUNCTION LIST

These include random access in O(1) time and complex consumption strategies, such as consumer groups.\\n    19→You can use streams to record and simultaneously syndicate events in real time.\\n    20→Examples of Redis stream use cases include:\\n    21→\\n    22→* Event sourcing (e.g., tracking user actions, clicks, etc.)\\n    23→* Sensor monitoring (e.g., readings from devices in the field) \\n    24→* Notifications (e.g., storing a record of each user\\'s notifications in a separate stream)\\n    25→\\n    26→Redis generates a unique ID for each stream entry.\\n    27→You can use these IDs to retrieve their associated entries later or to read and process all subsequent entries in the stream. Note that because these IDs are related to time, the ones shown here may vary and will be different from the IDs you see in your own Redis instance.\\n    28→\\n    29→Redis streams support several trimming strategies (to prevent streams from growing unbounded) and more than one consumption strategy (see [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}), [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}), and [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}})). Starting with Redis 8.2, the `XACKDEL`, `XDELEX`, `XADD`, and `XTRIM` commands provide fine-grained control over how stream operations interact with multiple consumer groups, simplifying the coordination of message processing across different applications.\\n    30→\\n    31→Beginning with Redis 8.6, Redis streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when using at-least-once delivery patterns. This feature enables reliable message submission with automatic deduplication.

It gets as its first argument the key name `race:france`, the second argument is the entry ID that identifies every entry inside a stream. However, in this case, we passed `*` because we want the server to generate a new ID for us. Every new ID will be monotonically increasing, so in more simple terms, every new entry added will have a higher ID compared to all the past entries. Auto-generation of IDs by the server is almost always what you want, and the reasons for specifying an ID explicitly are very rare. We\\'ll talk more about this later. The fact that each Stream entry has an ID is another similarity with log files, where line numbers, or the byte offset inside the file, can be used in order to identify a given entry. Returning back at our [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) example, after the key name and ID, the next arguments are the field-value pairs composing our stream entry.\\n   107→\\n   108→It is possible to get the number of items inside a Stream just using the [`XLEN`]({{< relref \"/commands/xlen\" >}}) command:\\n   109→\\n   110→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xlen\" description=\"Foundational: Get the total number of entries in a stream using XLEN\" >}}\\n   111→> XLEN race:france\\n   112→(integer) 4\\n   113→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   114→\\n   115→### Entry IDs\\n   116→\\n   117→The entry ID returned by the [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) command, and identifying univocally each entry inside a given stream, is composed of two parts:\\n   118→\\n   119→```\\n   120→<millisecondsTime>-<sequenceNumber>\\n   121→```\\n   122→\\n   123→The milliseconds time part is actually the local time in the local Redis node generating the stream ID, however if the current milliseconds time happens to be smaller than the previous entry time, then the previous entry time is used instead, so if a clock jumps backward the monotonically incrementing ID property still holds. The sequence number is used for entries created in the same millisecond. Since the sequence number is 64 bit wide, in practical terms there is no limit to the number of entries that can be generated within the same millisecond.\\n   124→\\n   125→The format of such IDs may look strange at first, and the gentle reader may wonder why the time is part of the ID. The reason is that Redis streams support range queries by ID. Because the ID is related to the time the entry is generated, this gives the ability to query for time ranges basically for free. We will see this soon while covering the [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}) command.\\n   126→\\n   127→If for some reason the user needs incremental IDs that are not related to time but are actually associated to another external system ID, as previously mentioned, the [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) command can take an explicit ID instead of the `*` wildcard ID that triggers auto-generation, like in the following examples:\\n   128→\\n   129→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xadd_id\" description=\"Specify explicit stream entry IDs instead of auto-generated ones when you need to use external system IDs\" difficulty=\"advanced\" >}}\\n   130→> XADD race:usa 0-1 racer Castilla\\n   131→0-1\\n   132→> XADD race:usa 0-2 racer Norem\\n   133→0-2\\n   134→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   135→\\n   136→Note that in this case, the minimum ID is 0-1 and that the command will not accept an ID equal or smaller than a previous one:\\n   137→\\n   138→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xadd_bad_id\" description=\"Understand ID validation - XADD rejects IDs that are not monotonically increasing\" difficulty=\"advanced\" >}}\\n   139→> XADD race:usa 0-1 racer Prickett\\n   140→(error) ERR The ID specified in XADD is equal or smaller than the target stream top item\\n   141→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   142→\\n   143→If you\\'re running Redis 7 or later, you can also provide an explicit ID consisting of the milliseconds part only. In this case, the sequence portion of the ID will be automatically generated. To do this, use the syntax below:\\n   144→\\n   145→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xadd_7\" description=\"Use partial explicit IDs with XADD to specify milliseconds while letting Redis auto-generate the sequence number\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   146→> XADD race:usa 0-* racer Prickett\\n   147→0-3\\n   148→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   149→\\n   150→## Getting data from Streams\\n   151→\\n   152→Now we are finally able to append entries in our stream via [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}). However, while appending data to a stream is quite obvious, the way streams can be queried in order to extract data is not so obvious. If we continue with the analogy of the log file, one obvious way is to mimic what we normally do with the Unix command `tail -f`, that is, we may start to listen in order to get the new messages that are appended to the stream. Note that unlike the blocking list operations of Redis, where a given element will reach a single client which is blocking in a *pop style* operation like [`BLPOP`]({{< relref \"/commands/blpop\" >}}), with streams we want multiple consumers to see the new messages appended to the stream (the same way many `tail -f` processes can see what is added to a log). Using the traditional terminology we want the streams to be able to *fan out* messages to multiple clients.\\n   153→\\n   154→However, this is just one potential access mode. We could also see a stream in quite a different way: not as a messaging system, but as a *time series store*. In this case, maybe it\\'s also useful to get the new messages appended, but another natural query mode is to get messages by ranges of time, or alternatively to iterate the messages using a cursor to incrementally check all the history. This is definitely another useful access mode.\\n   155→\\n   156→Finally, if we see a stream from the point of view of consumers, we may want to access the stream in yet another way, that is, as a stream of messages that can be partitioned to multiple consumers that are processing such messages, so that groups of consumers can only see a subset of the messages arriving in a single stream. In this way, it is possible to scale the message processing across different consumers, without single consumers having to process all the messages: each consumer will just get different messages to process. This is basically what Kafka (TM) does with consumer groups. Reading messages via consumer groups is yet another interesting mode of reading from a Redis Stream.\\n   157→\\n   158→Redis Streams support all three of the query modes described above via different commands. The next sections will show them all, starting from the simplest and most direct to use: range queries.\\n   159→\\n   160→### Querying by range: XRANGE and XREVRANGE\\n   161→\\n   162→To query the stream by range we are only required to specify two IDs, *start* and *end*. The range returned will include the elements having start or end as ID, so the range is inclusive.

We already said that the entry IDs have a relation with the time, because the part at the left of the `-` character is the Unix time in milliseconds of the local node that created the stream entry, at the moment the entry was created (however note that streams are replicated with fully specified [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) commands, so the replicas will have identical IDs to the master). This means that I could query a range of time using [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}). In order to do so, however, I may want to omit the sequence part of the ID: if omitted, in the start of the range it will be assumed to be 0, while in the end part it will be assumed to be the maximum sequence number available. This way, querying using just two milliseconds Unix times, we get all the entries that were generated in that range of time, in an inclusive way. For instance, if I want to query a two milliseconds period I could use:\\n   205→\\n   206→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xrange_time\" description=\"Query stream entries by time range using millisecond timestamps instead of full IDs\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   207→> XRANGE race:france 1692632086369 1692632086371\\n   208→1) 1) \"1692632086370-0\"\\n   209→   2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   210→      2) \"Castilla\"\\n   211→      3) \"speed\"\\n   212→      4) \"30.2\"\\n   213→      5) \"position\"\\n   214→      6) \"1\"\\n   215→      7) \"location_id\"\\n   216→      8) \"1\"\\n   217→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   218→\\n   219→I have only a single entry in this range.

If I want more, I can get the last ID returned, increment the sequence part by one, and query again. Let\\'s see this in the following example. Let\\'s assume that the stream `race:france` was populated with 4 items.

So [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}) is also the de facto *streams iterator* and does not require an **XSCAN** command.\\n   275→\\n   276→The command [`XREVRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrevrange\" >}}) is the equivalent of [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}) but returning the elements in inverted order, so a practical use for [`XREVRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrevrange\" >}}) is to check what is the last item in a Stream:\\n   277→\\n   278→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xrevrange\" description=\"Foundational: Retrieve stream entries in reverse order using XREVRANGE when you need the most recent entries first\" >}}\\n   279→> XREVRANGE race:france + - COUNT 1\\n   280→1) 1) \"1692632147973-0\"\\n   281→   2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   282→      2) \"Castilla\"\\n   283→      3) \"speed\"\\n   284→      4) \"29.9\"\\n   285→      5) \"position\"\\n   286→      6) \"1\"\\n   287→      7) \"location_id\"\\n   288→      8) \"2\"\\n   289→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   290→\\n   291→Note that the [`XREVRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrevrange\" >}}) command takes the *start* and *stop* arguments in reverse order.\\n   292→\\n   293→## Listening for new items with XREAD\\n   294→\\n   295→When we do not want to access items by a range in a stream, usually what we want instead is to *subscribe* to new items arriving to the stream. This concept may appear related to Redis Pub/Sub, where you subscribe to a channel, or to Redis blocking lists, where you wait for a key to get new elements to fetch, but there are fundamental differences in the way you consume a stream:\\n   296→\\n   297→1. A stream can have multiple clients (consumers) waiting for data. Every new item, by default, will be delivered to *every consumer* that is waiting for data in a given stream. This behavior is different than blocking lists, where each consumer will get a different element. However, the ability to *fan out* to multiple consumers is similar to Pub/Sub.\\n   298→2. While in Pub/Sub messages are *fire and forget* and are never stored anyway, and while when using blocking lists, when a message is received by the client it is *popped* (effectively removed) from the list, streams work in a fundamentally different way. All the messages are appended in the stream indefinitely (unless the user explicitly asks to delete entries): different consumers will know what is a new message from its point of view by remembering the ID of the last message received.\\n   299→3. Streams Consumer Groups provide a level of control that Pub/Sub or blocking lists cannot achieve, with different groups for the same stream, explicit acknowledgment of processed items, ability to inspect the pending items, claiming of unprocessed messages, and coherent history visibility for each single client, that is only able to see its private past history of messages.\\n   300→\\n   301→The command that provides the ability to listen for new messages arriving into a stream is called [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}). It\\'s a bit more complex than [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}), so we\\'ll start showing simple forms, and later the whole command layout will be provided.\\n   302→\\n   303→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xread\" description=\"Foundational: Read entries from a stream starting from a specific ID using XREAD (non-blocking form)\" >}}\\n   304→> XREAD COUNT 2 STREAMS race:france 0\\n   305→1) 1) \"race:france\"\\n   306→   2) 1) 1) \"1692632086370-0\"\\n   307→         2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   308→            2) \"Castilla\"\\n   309→            3) \"speed\"\\n   310→            4) \"30.2\"\\n   311→            5) \"position\"\\n   312→            6) \"1\"\\n   313→            7) \"location_id\"\\n   314→            8) \"1\"\\n   315→      2) 1) \"1692632094485-0\"\\n   316→         2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   317→            2) \"Norem\"\\n   318→            3) \"speed\"\\n   319→            4) \"28.8\"\\n   320→            5) \"position\"\\n   321→            6) \"3\"\\n   322→            7) \"location_id\"\\n   323→            8) \"1\"\\n   324→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   325→\\n   326→The above is the non-blocking form of [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}). Note that the **COUNT** option is not mandatory, in fact the only mandatory option of the command is the **STREAMS** option, that specifies a list of keys together with the corresponding maximum ID already seen for each stream by the calling consumer, so that the command will provide the client only with messages with an ID greater than the one we specified.\\n   327→\\n   328→In the above command we wrote `STREAMS race:france 0` so we want all the messages in the Stream `race:france` having an ID greater than `0-0`. As you can see in the example above, the command returns the key name, because actually it is possible to call this command with more than one key to read from different streams at the same time. I could write, for instance: `STREAMS race:france race:italy 0 0`. Note how after the **STREAMS** option we need to provide the key names, and later the IDs. For this reason, the **STREAMS** option must always be the last option.\\n   329→Any other options must come before the **STREAMS** option.\\n   330→\\n   331→Apart from the fact that [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}) can access multiple streams at once, and that we are able to specify the last ID we own to just get newer messages, in this simple form the command is not doing something so different compared to [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}). However, the interesting part is that we can turn [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}) into a *blocking command* easily, by specifying the **BLOCK** argument:\\n   332→\\n   333→```\\n   334→> XREAD BLOCK 0 STREAMS race:france $\\n   335→```\\n   336→\\n   337→Note that in the example above, other than removing **COUNT**, I specified the new **BLOCK** option with a timeout of 0 milliseconds (that means to never timeout). Moreover, instead of passing a normal ID for the stream `race:france` I passed the special ID `$`. This special ID means that [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}) should use as last ID the maximum ID already stored in the stream `race:france`, so that we will receive only *new* messages, starting from the time we started listening. This is similar to the `tail -f` Unix command in some way.\\n   338→\\n   339→Note that when the **BLOCK** option is used, we do not have to use the special ID `$`. We can use any valid ID. If the command is able to serve our request immediately without blocking, it will do so, otherwise it will block. Normally if we want to consume the stream starting from new entries, we start with the ID `$`, and after that we continue using the ID of the last message received to make the next call, and so forth.\\n   340→\\n   341→The blocking form of [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}) is also able to listen to multiple Streams, just by specifying multiple key names. If the request can be served synchronously because there is at least one stream with elements greater than the corresponding ID we specified, it returns with the results. Otherwise, the command will block and will return the items of the first stream which gets new data (according to the specified ID).\\n   342→\\n   343→Similarly to blocking list operations, blocking stream reads are *fair* from the point of view of clients waiting for data, since the semantics is FIFO style. The first client that blocked for a given stream will be the first to be unblocked when new items are available.\\n   344→\\n   345→[`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}) has no other options than **COUNT** and **BLOCK**, so it\\'s a pretty basic command with a specific purpose to attach consumers to one or multiple streams. More powerful features to consume streams are available using the consumer groups API, however reading via consumer groups is implemented by a different command called [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}), covered in the next section of this guide.\\n   346→\\n   347→## Consumer groups\\n   348→\\n   349→When the task at hand is to consume the same stream from different clients, then [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}) already offers a way to *fan-out* to N clients, potentially also using replicas in order to provide more read scalability. However in certain problems what we want to do is not to provide the same stream of messages to many clients, but to provide a *different subset* of messages from the same stream to many clients. An obvious case where this is useful is that of messages which are slow to process: the ability to have N different workers that will receive different parts of the stream allows us to scale message processing, by routing different messages to different workers that are ready to do more work.\\n   350→\\n   351→In practical terms, if we imagine having three consumers C1, C2, C3, and a stream that contains the messages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 then what we want is to serve the messages according to the following diagram:\\n   352→\\n   353→```\\n   354→1 -> C1\\n   355→2 -> C2\\n   356→3 -> C3\\n   357→4 -> C1\\n   358→5 -> C2\\n   359→6 -> C3\\n   360→7 -> C1\\n   361→```\\n   362→\\n   363→In order to achieve this, Redis uses a concept called *consumer groups*. It is very important to understand that Redis consumer groups have nothing to do, from an implementation standpoint, with Kafka (TM) consumer groups. Yet they are similar in functionality, so I decided to keep Kafka\\'s (TM) terminology, as it originally popularized this idea.\\n   364→\\n   365→A consumer group is like a *pseudo consumer* that gets data from a stream, and actually serves multiple consumers, providing certain guarantees:\\n   366→\\n   367→1. Each message is served to a different consumer so that it is not possible that the same message will be delivered to multiple consumers.\\n   368→2. Consumers are identified, within a consumer group, by a name, which is a case-sensitive string that the clients implementing consumers must choose. This means that even after a disconnect, the stream consumer group retains all the state, since the client will claim again to be the same consumer. However, this also means that it is up to the client to provide a unique identifier.\\n   369→3. Each consumer group has the concept of the *first ID never consumed* so that, when a consumer asks for new messages, it can provide just messages that were not previously delivered.\\n   370→4. Consuming a message, however, requires an explicit acknowledgment using a specific command. Redis interprets the acknowledgment as: this message was correctly processed so it can be evicted from the consumer group.\\n   371→5. A consumer group tracks all the messages that are currently pending, that is, messages that were delivered to some consumer of the consumer group, but are yet to be acknowledged as processed. Thanks to this feature, when accessing the message history of a stream, each consumer *will only see messages that were delivered to it*.\\n   372→\\n   373→In a way, a consumer group can be imagined as some *amount of state* about a stream:\\n   374→\\n   375→```\\n   376→+----------------------------------------+\\n   377→| consumer_group_name: mygroup           |\\n   378→| consumer_group_stream: somekey         |\\n   379→| last_delivered_id: 1292309234234-92    |\\n   380→|                                        |\\n   381→| consumers:                             |\\n   382→|    \"consumer-1\" with pending messages  |\\n   383→|       1292309234234-4                  |\\n   384→|       1292309234232-8                  |\\n   385→|    \"consumer-42\" with pending messages |\\n   386→|       ... (and so forth)               |\\n   387→+----------------------------------------+\\n   388→```\\n   389→\\n   390→If you see this from this point of view, it is very simple to understand what a consumer group can do, how it is able to just provide consumers with their history of pending messages, and how consumers asking for new messages will just be served with message IDs greater than `last_delivered_id`. At the same time, if you look at the consumer group as an auxiliary data structure for Redis streams, it is obvious that a single stream can have multiple consumer groups, that have a different set of consumers. Actually, it is even possible for the same stream to have clients reading without consumer groups via [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}), and clients reading via [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) in different consumer groups.\\n   391→\\n   392→Now it\\'s time to zoom in to see the fundamental consumer group commands. They are the following:\\n   393→\\n   394→* [`XGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xgroup\" >}}) is used in order to create, destroy and manage consumer groups.\\n   395→* [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) is used to read from a stream via a consumer group.\\n   396→* [`XACK`]({{< relref \"/commands/xack\" >}}) is the command that allows a consumer to mark a pending message as correctly processed.\\n   397→* [`XACKDEL`]({{< relref \"/commands/xackdel\" >}}) combines acknowledgment and deletion in a single atomic operation with enhanced control over consumer group references.\\n   398→\\n   399→## Creating a consumer group\\n   400→\\n   401→Assuming I have a key `race:france` of type stream already existing, in order to create a consumer group I just need to do the following:\\n   402→\\n   403→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xgroup_create\" description=\"Foundational: Create a consumer group for a stream using XGROUP CREATE to enable coordinated message consumption\" >}}\\n   404→> XGROUP CREATE race:france france_riders $\\n   405→OK\\n   406→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   407→\\n   408→As you can see in the command above when creating the consumer group we have to specify an ID, which in the example is just `$`. This is needed because the consumer group, among the other states, must have an idea about what message to serve next at the first consumer connecting, that is, what was the *last message ID* when the group was just created. If we provide `$` as we did, then only new messages arriving in the stream from now on will be provided to the consumers in the group. If we specify `0` instead the consumer group will consume *all* the messages in the stream history to start with. Of course, you can specify any other valid ID. What you know is that the consumer group will start delivering messages that are greater than the ID you specify. Because `$` means the current greatest ID in the stream, specifying `$` will have the effect of consuming only new messages.\\n   409→\\n   410→[`XGROUP CREATE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xgroup-create\" >}}) also supports creating the stream automatically, if it doesn\\'t exist, using the optional `MKSTREAM` subcommand as the last argument:\\n   411→\\n   412→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xgroup_create_mkstream\" description=\"Create a consumer group and stream atomically using XGROUP CREATE with MKSTREAM option\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   413→> XGROUP CREATE race:italy italy_riders $ MKSTREAM\\n   414→OK\\n   415→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   416→\\n   417→Now that the consumer group is created we can immediately try to read messages via the consumer group using the [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) command.

However there is a *mandatory* option that must be always specified, which is **GROUP** and has two arguments: the name of the consumer group, and the name of the consumer that is attempting to read. The option **COUNT** is also supported and is identical to the one in [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}).\\n   420→\\n   421→We\\'ll add riders to the race:italy stream and try reading something using the consumer group:\\n   422→Note: *here rider is the field name, and the name is the associated value.

Note however the `GROUP <group-name> <consumer-name>` provided above. It states that I want to read from the stream using the consumer group `mygroup` and I\\'m the consumer `Alice`. Every time a consumer performs an operation with a consumer group, it must specify its name, uniquely identifying this consumer inside the group.\\n   443→\\n   444→There is another very important detail in the command line above, after the mandatory **STREAMS** option the ID requested for the key `race:italy` is the special ID `>`. This special ID is only valid in the context of consumer groups, and it means: **messages never delivered to other consumers so far**.\\n   445→\\n   446→This is almost always what you want, however it is also possible to specify a real ID, such as `0` or any other valid ID, in this case, however, what happens is that we request from [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) to just provide us with the **history of pending messages**, and in such case, will never see new messages in the group. So basically [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) has the following behavior based on the ID we specify:\\n   447→\\n   448→* If the ID is the special ID `>` then the command will return only new messages never delivered to other consumers so far, and as a side effect, will update the consumer group\\'s *last ID*.\\n   449→* If the ID is any other valid numerical ID, then the command will let us access our *history of pending messages*.

So what happens is that Redis reports just *new* messages. As you can see the \"Castilla\" message is not delivered, since it was already delivered to Alice, so Bob gets Royce and Sam-Bodden and so forth.\\n   487→\\n   488→This way Alice, Bob, and any other consumer in the group, are able to read different messages from the same stream, to read their history of yet to process messages, or to mark messages as processed. This allows creating different topologies and semantics for consuming messages from a stream.\\n   489→\\n   490→There are a few things to keep in mind:\\n   491→\\n   492→* Consumers are auto-created the first time they are mentioned, no need for explicit creation.\\n   493→* Even with [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) you can read from multiple keys at the same time, however for this to work, you need to create a consumer group with the same name in every stream. This is not a common need, but it is worth mentioning that the feature is technically available.\\n   494→* [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) is a *write command* because even if it reads from the stream, the consumer group is modified as a side effect of reading, so it can only be called on master instances.\\n   495→\\n   496→An example of a consumer implementation, using consumer groups, written in the Ruby language could be the following. The Ruby code is aimed to be readable by virtually any experienced programmer, even if they do not know Ruby:\\n   497→\\n   498→```ruby\\n   499→require \\'redis\\'\\n   500→\\n   501→if ARGV.length == 0\\n   502→    puts \"Please specify a consumer name\"\\n   503→    exit 1\\n   504→end\\n   505→\\n   506→ConsumerName = ARGV[0]\\n   507→GroupName = \"mygroup\"\\n   508→r = Redis.new\\n   509→\\n   510→def process_message(id,msg)\\n   511→    puts \"[#{ConsumerName}] #{id} = #{msg.inspect}\"\\n   512→end\\n   513→\\n   514→$lastid = \\'0-0\\'\\n   515→\\n   516→puts \"Consumer #{ConsumerName} starting...\"\\n   517→check_backlog = true\\n   518→while true\\n   519→    # Pick the ID based on the iteration: the first time we want to\\n   520→    # read our pending messages, in case we crashed and are recovering.\\n   521→    # Once we consumed our history, we can start getting new messages.\\n   522→    if check_backlog\\n   523→        myid = $lastid\\n   524→    else\\n   525→        myid = \\'>\\'\\n   526→    end\\n   527→\\n   528→    items = r.xreadgroup(\\'GROUP\\',GroupName,ConsumerName,\\'BLOCK\\',\\'2000\\',\\'COUNT\\',\\'10\\',\\'STREAMS\\',:my_stream_key,myid)\\n   529→\\n   530→    if items == nil\\n   531→        puts \"Timeout!\"\\n   532→        next\\n   533→    end\\n   534→\\n   535→    # If we receive an empty reply, it means we were consuming our history\\n   536→    # and that the history is now empty. Let\\'s start to consume new messages.\\n   537→    check_backlog = false if items[0][1].length == 0\\n   538→\\n   539→    items[0][1].each{|i|\\n   540→        id,fields = i\\n   541→\\n   542→        # Process the message\\n   543→        process_message(id,fields)\\n   544→\\n   545→        # Acknowledge the message as processed\\n   546→        r.xack(:my_stream_key,GroupName,id)\\n   547→\\n   548→        $lastid = id\\n   549→    }\\n   550→end\\n   551→```\\n   552→\\n   553→As you can see the idea here is to start by consuming the history, that is, our list of pending messages. This is useful because the consumer may have crashed before, so in the event of a restart we want to re-read messages that were delivered to us without getting acknowledged. Note that we might process a message multiple times or one time (at least in the case of consumer failures, but there are also the limits of Redis persistence and replication involved, see the specific section about this topic).\\n   554→\\n   555→Once the history was consumed, and we get an empty list of messages, we can switch to using the `>` special ID in order to consume new messages.\\n   556→\\n   557→## Recovering from permanent failures\\n   558→\\n   559→The example above allows us to write consumers that participate in the same consumer group, each taking a subset of messages to process, and when recovering from failures re-reading the pending messages that were delivered just to them. However in the real world consumers may permanently fail and never recover. What happens to the pending messages of the consumer that never recovers after stopping for any reason?\\n   560→\\n   561→Redis consumer groups offer a feature that is used in these situations in order to *claim* the pending messages of a given consumer so that such messages will change ownership and will be re-assigned to a different consumer. The feature is very explicit. A consumer has to inspect the list of pending messages, and will have to claim specific messages using a special command, otherwise the server will leave the messages pending forever and assigned to the old consumer. In this way different applications can choose if to use such a feature or not, and exactly how to use it.\\n   562→\\n   563→The first step of this process is just a command that provides observability of pending entries in the consumer group and is called [`XPENDING`]({{< relref \"/commands/xpending\" >}}).\\n   564→This is a read-only command which is always safe to call and will not change ownership of any message.\\n   565→In its simplest form, the command is called with two arguments, which are the name of the stream and the name of the consumer group.\\n   566→\\n   567→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xpending\" description=\"View pending message summary for a consumer group using XPENDING to monitor unacknowledged messages\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   568→> XPENDING race:italy italy_riders\\n   569→1) (integer) 2\\n   570→2) \"1692632647899-0\"\\n   571→3) \"1692632662819-0\"\\n   572→4) 1) 1) \"Bob\"\\n   573→      2) \"2\"\\n   574→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   575→\\n   576→When called in this way, the command outputs the total number of pending messages in the consumer group (two in this case), the lower and higher message ID among the pending messages, and finally a list of consumers and the number of pending messages they have.\\n   577→We have only Bob with two pending messages because the single message that Alice requested was acknowledged using [`XACK`]({{< relref \"/commands/xack\" >}}).\\n   578→\\n   579→We can ask for more information by giving more arguments to [`XPENDING`]({{< relref \"/commands/xpending\" >}}), because the full command signature is the following:\\n   580→\\n   581→```\\n   582→XPENDING <key> <groupname> [[IDLE <min-idle-time>] <start-id> <end-id> <count> [<consumer-name>]]\\n   583→```\\n   584→\\n   585→By providing a start and end ID (that can be just `-` and `+` as in [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}})) and a count to control the amount of information returned by the command, we are able to know more about the pending messages. The optional final argument, the consumer name, is used if we want to limit the output to just messages pending for a given consumer, but won\\'t use this feature in the following example.\\n   586→\\n   587→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xpending_plus_minus\" description=\"Get detailed pending message information including idle time and delivery count using XPENDING with range\" difficulty=\"advanced\" >}}\\n   588→> XPENDING race:italy italy_riders - + 10\\n   589→1) 1) \"1692632647899-0\"\\n   590→   2) \"Bob\"\\n   591→   3) (integer) 74642\\n   592→   4) (integer) 1\\n   593→2) 1) \"1692632662819-0\"\\n   594→   2) \"Bob\"\\n   595→   3) (integer) 74642\\n   596→   4) (integer) 1\\n   597→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   598→\\n   599→Now we have the details for each message: the ID, the consumer name, the *idle time* in milliseconds, which is how many milliseconds have passed since the last time the message was delivered to some consumer, and finally the number of times that a given message was delivered.\\n   600→We have two messages from Bob, and they are idle for 60000+ milliseconds, about a minute.\\n   601→\\n   602→Note that nobody prevents us from checking what the first message content was by just using [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}).\\n   603→\\n   604→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xrange_pending\" description=\"Retrieve the content of pending messages using XRANGE to inspect what needs to be processed\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   605→> XRANGE race:italy 1692632647899-0 1692632647899-0\\n   606→1) 1) \"1692632647899-0\"\\n   607→   2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   608→      2) \"Royce\"\\n   609→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   610→\\n   611→We have just to repeat the same ID twice in the arguments. Now that we have some ideas, Alice may decide that after 1 minute of not processing messages, Bob will probably not recover quickly, and it\\'s time to *claim* such messages and resume the processing in place of Bob. To do so, we use the [`XCLAIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xclaim\" >}}) command.\\n   612→\\n   613→This command is very complex and full of options in its full form, since it is used for replication of consumer groups changes, but we\\'ll use just the arguments that we need normally. In this case it is as simple as:\\n   614→\\n   615→```\\n   616→XCLAIM <key> <group> <consumer> <min-idle-time> <ID-1> <ID-2> ... <ID-N>\\n   617→```\\n   618→\\n   619→Basically we say, for this specific key and group, I want that the message IDs specified will change ownership, and will be assigned to the specified consumer name `<consumer>`. However, we also provide a minimum idle time, so that the operation will only work if the idle time of the mentioned messages is greater than the specified idle time. This is useful because maybe two clients are retrying to claim a message at the same time:\\n   620→\\n   621→```\\n   622→Client 1: XCLAIM race:italy italy_riders Alice 60000 1692632647899-0\\n   623→Client 2: XCLAIM race:italy italy_riders Lora 60000 1692632647899-0\\n   624→```\\n   625→\\n   626→However, as a side effect, claiming a message will reset its idle time and will increment its number of deliveries counter, so the second client will fail claiming it. In this way we avoid trivial re-processing of messages (even if in the general case you cannot obtain exactly once processing).\\n   627→\\n   628→This is the result of the command execution:\\n   629→\\n   630→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xclaim\" description=\"Claim pending messages from another consumer using XCLAIM when a consumer fails to process messages\" difficulty=\"advanced\" >}}\\n   631→> XCLAIM race:italy italy_riders Alice 60000 1692632647899-0\\n   632→1) 1) \"1692632647899-0\"\\n   633→   2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   634→      2) \"Royce\"\\n   635→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   636→\\n   637→The message was successfully claimed by Alice, who can now process the message and acknowledge it, and move things forward even if the original consumer is not recovering.\\n   638→\\n   639→It is clear from the example above that as a side effect of successfully claiming a given message, the [`XCLAIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xclaim\" >}}) command also returns it. However this is not mandatory. The **JUSTID** option can be used in order to return just the IDs of the message successfully claimed. This is useful if you want to reduce the bandwidth used between the client and the server (and also the performance of the command) and you are not interested in the message because your consumer is implemented in a way that it will rescan the history of pending messages from time to time.\\n   640→\\n   641→Claiming may also be implemented by a separate process: one that just checks the list of pending messages, and assigns idle messages to consumers that appear to be active. Active consumers can be obtained using one of the observability features of Redis streams. This is the topic of the next section.\\n   642→\\n   643→## Automatic claiming\\n   644→\\n   645→The [`XAUTOCLAIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xautoclaim\" >}}) command, added in Redis 6.2, implements the claiming process that we\\'ve described above.\\n   646→[`XPENDING`]({{< relref \"/commands/xpending\" >}}) and [`XCLAIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xclaim\" >}}) provide the basic building blocks for different types of recovery mechanisms.\\n   647→This command optimizes the generic process by having Redis manage it and offers a simple solution for most recovery needs.\\n   648→\\n   649→[`XAUTOCLAIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xautoclaim\" >}}) identifies idle pending messages and transfers ownership of them to a consumer.\\n   650→The command\\'s signature looks like this:\\n   651→\\n   652→```\\n   653→XAUTOCLAIM <key> <group> <consumer> <min-idle-time> <start> [COUNT count] [JUSTID]\\n   654→```\\n   655→\\n   656→So, in the example above, I could have used automatic claiming to claim a single message like this:\\n   657→\\n   658→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xautoclaim\" description=\"Practical pattern: Automatically claim idle pending messages using XAUTOCLAIM for simplified consumer failure recovery\" difficulty=\"advanced\" >}}\\n   659→> XAUTOCLAIM race:italy italy_riders Alice 60000 0-0 COUNT 1\\n   660→1) \"0-0\"\\n   661→2) 1) 1) \"1692632662819-0\"\\n   662→      2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   663→         2) \"Sam-Bodden\"\\n   664→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   665→\\n   666→Like [`XCLAIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xclaim\" >}}), the command replies with an array of the claimed messages, but it also returns a stream ID that allows iterating the pending entries.\\n   667→The stream ID is a cursor, and I can use it in my next call to continue in claiming idle pending messages:\\n   668→\\n   669→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xautoclaim_cursor\" description=\"Continue automatic claiming using the cursor returned by XAUTOCLAIM to iterate through pending messages\" difficulty=\"advanced\" >}}\\n   670→> XAUTOCLAIM race:italy italy_riders Lora 60000 (1692632662819-0 COUNT 1\\n   671→1) \"1692632662819-0\"\\n   672→2) 1) 1) \"1692632647899-0\"\\n   673→      2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   674→         2) \"Royce\"\\n   675→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   676→\\n   677→When [`XAUTOCLAIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xautoclaim\" >}}) returns the \"0-0\" stream ID as a cursor, that means that it reached the end of the consumer group pending entries list.\\n   678→That doesn\\'t mean that there are no new idle pending messages, so the process continues by calling [`XAUTOCLAIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xautoclaim\" >}}) from the beginning of the stream.\\n   679→\\n   680→## Claiming and the delivery counter\\n   681→\\n   682→The counter that you observe in the [`XPENDING`]({{< relref \"/commands/xpending\" >}}) output is the number of deliveries of each message. The counter is incremented in two ways: when a message is successfully claimed via [`XCLAIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xclaim\" >}}) or when an [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) call is used in order to access the history of pending messages.\\n   683→\\n   684→When there are failures, it is normal that messages will be delivered multiple times, but eventually they usually get processed and acknowledged. However there might be a problem processing some specific message, because it is corrupted or crafted in a way that triggers a bug in the processing code. In such a case what happens is that consumers will continuously fail to process this particular message. Because we have the counter of the delivery attempts, we can use that counter to detect messages that for some reason are not processable. So once the deliveries counter reaches a given large number that you chose, it is probably wiser to put such messages in another stream and send a notification to the system administrator. This is basically the way that Redis Streams implements the *dead letter* concept.\\n   685→\\n   686→## Working with multiple consumer groups\\n   687→\\n   688→Redis Streams can be associated with multiple consumer groups, where each entry is delivered to all the stream\\'s consumer groups. Within each consumer group, consumers handle a portion of the entries collaboratively. This design enables different applications or services to process the same stream data independently.\\n   689→\\n   690→Traditionally, when a consumer processesed a message, it acknowledged it using the [`XACK`]({{< relref \"/commands/xack\" >}}) command, which removed the entry reference from the Pending Entries List (PEL) of that specific consumer group. However, the entry remained in the stream and in the PELs of other consumer groups until they also acknowledge it. Applications needed to implement complex logic to delete entries from the stream only after all consumer groups had acknowledged them. This coordination was challenging to implement correctly and efficiently.\\n   691→\\n   692→### Enhanced deletion control in Redis 8.2\\n   693→\\n   694→Starting with Redis 8.2, several commands provide enhanced control over how entries are handled with respect to multiple consumer groups:\\n   695→\\n   696→* [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) with trimming options now supports `KEEPREF`, `DELREF`, and `ACKED` modes\\n   697→* [`XTRIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xtrim\" >}}) supports the same reference handling options\\n   698→* [`XDELEX`]({{< relref \"/commands/xdelex\" >}}) provides fine-grained deletion control\\n   699→* [`XACKDEL`]({{< relref \"/commands/xackdel\" >}}) combines acknowledgment and deletion atomically\\n   700→\\n   701→These options control how consumer group references are handled:\\n   702→\\n   703→- **KEEPREF** (default): Preserves existing references to entries in all consumer groups\\' PELs, maintaining backward compatibility\\n   704→- **DELREF**: Removes all references to entries from all consumer groups\\' PELs, effectively cleaning up all traces of the messages\\n   705→- **ACKED**: Only processes entries that have been acknowledged by all consumer groups\\n   706→\\n   707→The `ACKED` option is particularly useful as it automates the complex logic of coordinating deletion across multiple consumer groups, ensuring entries are only removed when all groups have finished processing them.\\n   708→\\n   709→## Streams observability\\n   710→\\n   711→Messaging systems that lack observability are very hard to work with. Not knowing who is consuming messages, what messages are pending, the set of consumer groups active in a given stream, makes everything opaque. For this reason, Redis Streams and consumer groups have different ways to observe what is happening. We already covered [`XPENDING`]({{< relref \"/commands/xpending\" >}}), which allows us to inspect the list of messages that are under processing at a given moment, together with their idle time and number of deliveries.\\n   712→\\n   713→However we may want to do more than that, and the [`XINFO`]({{< relref \"/commands/xinfo\" >}}) command is an observability interface that can be used with sub-commands in order to get information about streams or consumer groups.\\n   714→\\n   715→This command uses subcommands in order to show different information about the status of the stream and its consumer groups. For instance **XINFO STREAM <key>** reports information about the stream itself.\\n   716→\\n   717→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xinfo\" description=\"Get detailed stream information including length, encoding, and consumer groups using XINFO STREAM\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   718→> XINFO STREAM race:italy\\n   719→ 1) \"length\"\\n   720→ 2) (integer) 5\\n   721→ 3) \"radix-tree-keys\"\\n   722→ 4) (integer) 1\\n   723→ 5) \"radix-tree-nodes\"\\n   724→ 6) (integer) 2\\n   725→ 7) \"last-generated-id\"\\n   726→ 8) \"1692632678249-0\"\\n   727→ 9) \"groups\"\\n   728→10) (integer) 1\\n   729→11) \"first-entry\"\\n   730→12) 1) \"1692632639151-0\"\\n   731→    2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   732→       2) \"Castilla\"\\n   733→13) \"last-entry\"\\n   734→14) 1) \"1692632678249-0\"\\n   735→    2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   736→       2) \"Norem\"\\n   737→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   738→\\n   739→The output shows information about how the stream is encoded internally, and also shows the first and last message in the stream. Another piece of information available is the number of consumer groups associated with this stream. We can dig further asking for more information about the consumer groups.\\n   740→\\n   741→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xinfo_groups\" description=\"List all consumer groups for a stream using XINFO GROUPS to see group status and pending message counts\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   742→> XINFO GROUPS race:italy\\n   743→1) 1) \"name\"\\n   744→   2) \"italy_riders\"\\n   745→   3) \"consumers\"\\n   746→   4) (integer) 3\\n   747→   5) \"pending\"\\n   748→   6) (integer) 2\\n   749→   7) \"last-delivered-id\"\\n   750→   8) \"1692632662819-0\"\\n   751→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   752→\\n   753→As you can see in this and in the previous output, the [`XINFO`]({{< relref \"/commands/xinfo\" >}}) command outputs a sequence of field-value items. Because it is an observability command this allows the human user to immediately understand what information is reported, and allows the command to report more information in the future by adding more fields without breaking compatibility with older clients. Other commands that must be more bandwidth efficient, like [`XPENDING`]({{< relref \"/commands/xpending\" >}}), just report the information without the field names.\\n   754→\\n   755→The output of the example above, where the **GROUPS** subcommand is used, should be clear observing the field names.

The partitions are only *logical* and the messages are just put into a single Redis key, so the way the different clients are served is based on who is ready to process new messages, and not from which partition clients are reading. For instance, if the consumer C3 at some point fails permanently, Redis will continue to serve C1 and C2 all the new messages arriving, as if now there are only two *logical* partitions.\\n   797→\\n   798→Similarly, if a given consumer is much faster at processing messages than the other consumers, this consumer will receive proportionally more messages in the same unit of time. This is possible since Redis tracks all the unacknowledged messages explicitly, and remembers who received which message and the ID of the first message never delivered to any consumer.\\n   799→\\n   800→However, this also means that in Redis if you really want to partition messages in the same stream into multiple Redis instances, you have to use multiple keys and some sharding system such as Redis Cluster or some other application-specific sharding system. A single Redis stream is not automatically partitioned to multiple instances.\\n   801→\\n   802→We could say that schematically the following is true:\\n   803→\\n   804→* If you use 1 stream -> 1 consumer, you are processing messages in order.\\n   805→* If you use N streams with N consumers, so that only a given consumer hits a subset of the N streams, you can scale the above model of 1 stream -> 1 consumer.\\n   806→* If you use 1 stream -> N consumers, you are load balancing to N consumers, however in that case, messages about the same logical item may be consumed out of order, because a given consumer may process message 3 faster than another consumer is processing message 4.\\n   807→\\n   808→So basically Kafka partitions are more similar to using N different Redis keys, while Redis consumer groups are a server-side load balancing system of messages from a given stream to N different consumers.\\n   809→\\n   810→## Capped Streams\\n   811→\\n   812→Many applications do not want to collect data into a stream forever. Sometimes it is useful to have at maximum a given number of items inside a stream, other times once a given size is reached, it is useful to move data from Redis to a storage which is not in memory and not as fast but suited to store the history for, potentially, decades to come. Redis streams have some support for this. One is the **MAXLEN** option of the [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) command. This option is very simple to use:\\n   813→\\n   814→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"maxlen\" description=\"Limit stream size using MAXLEN option with XADD to automatically evict old entries and maintain constant memory usage\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   815→> XADD race:italy MAXLEN 2 * rider Jones\\n   816→\"1692633189161-0\"\\n   817→> XADD race:italy MAXLEN 2 * rider Wood\\n   818→\"1692633198206-0\"\\n   819→> XADD race:italy MAXLEN 2 * rider Henshaw\\n   820→\"1692633208557-0\"\\n   821→> XLEN race:italy\\n   822→(integer) 2\\n   823→> XRANGE race:italy - +\\n   824→1) 1) \"1692633198206-0\"\\n   825→   2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   826→      2) \"Wood\"\\n   827→2) 1) \"1692633208557-0\"\\n   828→   2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   829→      2) \"Henshaw\"\\n   830→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   831→\\n   832→Using **MAXLEN** the old entries are automatically evicted when the specified length is reached, so that the stream is left at a constant size. There is currently no option to tell the stream to just retain items that are not older than a given period, because such command, in order to run consistently, would potentially block for a long time in order to evict items. Imagine for example what happens if there is an insertion spike, then a long pause, and another insertion, all with the same maximum time. The stream would block to evict the data that became too old during the pause. So it is up to the user to do some planning and understand what is the maximum stream length desired. Moreover, while the length of the stream is proportional to the memory used, trimming by time is less simple to control and anticipate: it depends on the insertion rate which often changes over time (and when it does not change, then to just trim by size is trivial).\\n   833→\\n   834→However trimming with **MAXLEN** can be expensive: streams are represented by macro nodes into a radix tree, in order to be very memory efficient. Altering the single macro node, consisting of a few tens of elements, is not optimal. So it\\'s possible to use the command in the following special form:\\n   835→\\n   836→```\\n   837→XADD race:italy MAXLEN ~ 1000 * ... entry fields here ...\\n   838→```\\n   839→\\n   840→The `~` argument between the **MAXLEN** option and the actual count means, I don\\'t really need this to be exactly 1000 items. It can be 1000 or 1010 or 1030, just make sure to save at least 1000 items. With this argument, the trimming is performed only when we can remove a whole node. This makes it much more efficient, and it is usually what you want. You\\'ll note here that the client libraries have various implementations of this. For example, the Python client defaults to approximate and has to be explicitly set to a true length.\\n   841→\\n   842→There is also the [`XTRIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xtrim\" >}}) command, which performs something very similar to what the **MAXLEN** option does above, except that it can be run by itself:\\n   843→\\n   844→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xtrim\" description=\"Trim a stream to a maximum length using XTRIM MAXLEN to remove old entries\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   845→> XTRIM race:italy MAXLEN 10\\n   846→(integer) 0\\n   847→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   848→\\n   849→Or, as for the [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) option:\\n   850→\\n   851→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xtrim2\" description=\"Use approximate trimming with XTRIM MAXLEN ~ for more efficient memory management\" difficulty=\"intermediate\" >}}\\n   852→> XTRIM mystream MAXLEN ~ 10\\n   853→(integer) 0\\n   854→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   855→\\n   856→However, [`XTRIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xtrim\" >}}) is designed to accept different trimming strategies. Another trimming strategy is **MINID**, that evicts entries with IDs lower than the one specified.\\n   857→\\n   858→As [`XTRIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xtrim\" >}}) is an explicit command, the user is expected to know about the possible shortcomings of different trimming strategies.\\n   859→\\n   860→### Trimming with consumer group awareness\\n   861→\\n   862→Starting with Redis 8.2, both [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) with trimming options and [`XTRIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xtrim\" >}}) support enhanced control over how trimming interacts with consumer groups through the `KEEPREF`, `DELREF`, and `ACKED` options:\\n   863→\\n   864→```\\n   865→XADD mystream KEEPREF MAXLEN 1000 * field value\\n   866→XTRIM mystream ACKED MAXLEN 1000\\n   867→```\\n   868→\\n   869→- **KEEPREF** (default): Trims entries according to the strategy but preserves references in consumer group PELs\\n   870→- **DELREF**: Trims entries and removes all references from consumer group PELs\\n   871→- **ACKED**: Only trims entries that have been acknowledged by all consumer groups\\n   872→\\n   873→The `ACKED` option is particularly useful for maintaining data integrity across multiple consumer groups, ensuring that entries are only removed when all groups have finished processing them.\\n   874→\\n   875→Another useful eviction strategy that may be added to [`XTRIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xtrim\" >}}) in the future, is to remove by a range of IDs to ease use of [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}) and [`XTRIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xtrim\" >}}) to move data from Redis to other storage systems if needed.\\n   876→\\n   877→## Special IDs in the streams API\\n   878→\\n   879→You may have noticed that there are several special IDs that can be used in the Redis API. Here is a short recap, so that they can make more sense in the future.\\n   880→\\n   881→The first two special IDs are `-` and `+`, and are used in range queries with the [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}) command. Those two IDs respectively mean the smallest ID possible (that is basically `0-1`) and the greatest ID possible (that is `18446744073709551615-18446744073709551615`). As you can see it is a lot cleaner to write `-` and `+` instead of those numbers.\\n   882→\\n   883→Then there are APIs where we want to say, the ID of the item with the greatest ID inside the stream. This is what `$` means. So for instance if I want only new entries with [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) I use this ID to signify I already have all the existing entries, but not the new ones that will be inserted in the future. Similarly when I create or set the ID of a consumer group, I can set the last delivered item to `$` in order to just deliver new entries to the consumers in the group.\\n   884→\\n   885→As you can see `$` does not mean `+`, they are two different things, as `+` is the greatest ID possible in every possible stream, while `$` is the greatest ID in a given stream containing given entries. Moreover APIs will usually only understand `+` or `$`, yet it was useful to avoid loading a given symbol with multiple meanings.\\n   886→\\n   887→Another special ID is `>`, that is a special meaning only related to consumer groups and only when the [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) command is used. This special ID means that we want only entries that were never delivered to other consumers so far. So basically the `>` ID is the *last delivered ID* of a consumer group.\\n   888→\\n   889→Finally the special ID `*`, that can be used only with the [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) command, means to auto select an ID for us for the new entry.\\n   890→\\n   891→So we have `-`, `+`, `$`, `>` and `*`, and all have a different meaning, and most of the time, can be used in different contexts.\\n   892→\\n   893→## Persistence, replication and message safety\\n   894→\\n   895→A Stream, like any other Redis data structure, is asynchronously replicated to replicas and persisted into AOF and RDB files. However what may not be so obvious is that also the consumer groups full state is propagated to AOF, RDB and replicas, so if a message is pending in the master, also the replica will have the same information. Similarly, after a restart, the AOF will restore the consumer groups\\' state.\\n   896→\\n   897→However note that Redis streams and consumer groups are persisted and replicated using the Redis default replication, so:\\n   898→\\n   899→* AOF must be used with a strong fsync policy if persistence of messages is important in your application.\\n   900→* By default the asynchronous replication will not guarantee that [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) commands or consumer groups state changes are replicated: after a failover something can be missing depending on the ability of replicas to receive the data from the master.\\n   901→* The [`WAIT`]({{< relref \"/commands/wait\" >}}) command may be used in order to force the propagation of the changes to a set of replicas. However note that while this makes it very unlikely that data is lost, the Redis failover process as operated by Sentinel or Redis Cluster performs only a *best effort* check to failover to the replica which is the most updated, and under certain specific failure conditions may promote a replica that lacks some data.\\n   902→\\n   903→So when designing an application using Redis streams and consumer groups, make sure to understand the semantical properties your application should have during failures, and configure things accordingly, evaluating whether it is safe enough for your use case.\\n   904→\\n   905→## Removing single items from a stream\\n   906→\\n   907→Streams also have a special command for removing items from the middle of a stream, just by ID. Normally for an append only data structure this may look like an odd feature, but it is actually useful for applications involving, for instance, privacy regulations. The command is called [`XDEL`]({{< relref \"/commands/xdel\" >}}) and receives the name of the stream followed by the IDs to delete:\\n   908→\\n   909→{{< clients-example set=\"stream_tutorial\" step=\"xdel\" description=\"Delete specific entries from a stream by ID using XDEL for privacy or data cleanup purposes\" difficulty=\"advanced\" >}}\\n   910→> XRANGE race:italy - + COUNT 2\\n   911→1) 1) \"1692633198206-0\"\\n   912→   2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   913→      2) \"Wood\"\\n   914→2) 1) \"1692633208557-0\"\\n   915→   2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   916→      2) \"Henshaw\"\\n   917→> XDEL race:italy 1692633208557-0\\n   918→(integer) 1\\n   919→> XRANGE race:italy - + COUNT 2\\n   920→1) 1) \"1692633198206-0\"\\n   921→   2) 1) \"rider\"\\n   922→      2) \"Wood\"\\n   923→{{< /clients-example >}}\\n   924→\\n   925→### Enhanced deletion with XDELEX\\n   926→\\n   927→Starting with Redis 8.2, the [`XDELEX`]({{< relref \"/commands/xdelex\" >}}) command provides enhanced control over entry deletion, particularly when working with consumer groups. Like other enhanced commands, it supports `KEEPREF`, `DELREF`, and `ACKED` options:\\n   928→\\n   929→```\\n   930→XDELEX mystream ACKED IDS 2 1692633198206-0 1692633208557-0\\n   931→```\\n   932→\\n   933→This allows you to delete entries only when they have been acknowledged by all consumer groups (`ACKED`), remove all consumer group references (`DELREF`), or preserve existing references (`KEEPREF`).\\n   934→\\n   935→## Zero length streams\\n   936→\\n   937→A difference between streams and other Redis data structures is that when the other data structures no longer have any elements, as a side effect of calling commands that remove elements, the key itself will be removed. So for instance, a sorted set will be completely removed when a call to [`ZREM`]({{< relref \"/commands/zrem\" >}}) will remove the last element in the sorted set. Streams, on the other hand, are allowed to stay at zero elements, both as a result of using a **MAXLEN** option with a count of zero ([`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) and [`XTRIM`]({{< relref \"/commands/xtrim\" >}}) commands), or because [`XDEL`]({{< relref \"/commands/xdel\" >}}) was called.\\n   938→\\n   939→The reason why such an asymmetry exists is because Streams may have associated consumer groups, and we do not want to lose the state that the consumer groups defined just because there are no longer any items in the stream. Currently the stream is not deleted even when it has no associated consumer groups.\\n   940→\\n   941→## Total latency of consuming a message\\n   942→\\n   943→Non blocking stream commands like [`XRANGE`]({{< relref \"/commands/xrange\" >}}) and [`XREAD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xread\" >}}) or [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) without the BLOCK option are served synchronously like any other Redis command, so to discuss latency of such commands is meaningless: it is more interesting to check the time complexity of the commands in the Redis documentation. It should be enough to say that stream commands are at least as fast as sorted set commands when extracting ranges, and that [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) is very fast and can easily insert from half a million to one million items per second in an average machine if pipelining is used.\\n   944→\\n   945→However latency becomes an interesting parameter if we want to understand the delay of processing a message, in the context of blocking consumers in a consumer group, from the moment the message is produced via [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}), to the moment the message is obtained by the consumer because [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) returned with the message.\\n   946→\\n   947→## How serving blocked consumers works\\n   948→\\n   949→Before providing the results of performed tests, it is interesting to understand what model Redis uses in order to route stream messages (and in general actually how any blocking operation waiting for data is managed).\\n   950→\\n   951→* The blocked client is referenced in a hash table that maps keys for which there is at least one blocking consumer, to a list of consumers that are waiting for such key. This way, given a key that received data, we can resolve all the clients that are waiting for such data.\\n   952→* When a write happens, in this case when the [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) command is called, it calls the `signalKeyAsReady()` function. This function will put the key into a list of keys that need to be processed, because such keys may have new data for blocked consumers. Note that such *ready keys* will be processed later, so in the course of the same event loop cycle, it is possible that the key will receive other writes.\\n   953→* Finally, before returning into the event loop, the *ready keys* are finally processed. For each key the list of clients waiting for data is scanned, and if applicable, such clients will receive the new data that arrived. In the case of streams the data is the messages in the applicable range requested by the consumer.\\n   954→\\n   955→As you can see, basically, before returning to the event loop both the client calling [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) and the clients blocked to consume messages, will have their reply in the output buffers, so the caller of [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}) should receive the reply from Redis at about the same time the consumers will receive the new messages.\\n   956→\\n   957→This model is *push-based*, since adding data to the consumers buffers will be performed directly by the action of calling [`XADD`]({{< relref \"/commands/xadd\" >}}), so the latency tends to be quite predictable.\\n   958→\\n   959→## Latency tests results\\n   960→\\n   961→In order to check these latency characteristics a test was performed using multiple instances of Ruby programs pushing messages having as an additional field the computer millisecond time, and Ruby programs reading the messages from the consumer group and processing them. The message processing step consisted of comparing the current computer time with the message timestamp, in order to understand the total latency.\\n   962→\\n   963→Results obtained:\\n   964→\\n   965→```\\n   966→Processed between 0 and 1 ms -> 74.11%\\n   967→Processed between 1 and 2 ms -> 25.80%\\n   968→Processed between 2 and 3 ms -> 0.06%\\n   969→Processed between 3 and 4 ms -> 0.01%\\n   970→Processed between 4 and 5 ms -> 0.02%\\n   971→```\\n   972→\\n   973→So 99.9% of requests have a latency <= 2 milliseconds, with the outliers that remain still very close to the average.\\n   974→\\n   975→Adding a few million unacknowledged messages to the stream does not change the gist of the benchmark, with most queries still processed with very short latency.\\n   976→\\n   977→A few remarks:\\n   978→\\n   979→* Here we processed up to 10k messages per iteration, this means that the `COUNT` parameter of [`XREADGROUP`]({{< relref \"/commands/xreadgroup\" >}}) was set to 10000. This adds a lot of latency but is needed in order to allow the slow consumers to be able to keep with the message flow. So you can expect a real world latency that is a lot smaller.\\n   980→* The system used for this benchmark is very slow compared to today\\'s standards.\\n   981→\\n   982→## Learn more\\n   983→\\n   984→* [Redis Streams Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8qcpXyMAiA) is an entertaining introduction to streams in Redis.\\n   985→* [Redis University\\'s RU202](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru202/) is a free, online course dedicated to Redis Streams.\\n   986→\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

For example, for a desired false positive rate of 0.1% (1 in 1000), error_rate should be set to 0.001.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the number of items you expect having in your filter in total and is trivial when you have a static set but it becomes more challenging when your set grows over time. It\\'s important to get the number right because if you **oversize** - you\\'ll end up wasting memory. If you **undersize**, the filter will fill up and a new one will have to be stacked on top of it (sub-filter stacking). In the cases when a filter consists of multiple sub-filters stacked on top of each other latency for adds stays the same, but the latency for presence checks increases. The reason for this is the way the checks work: a regular check would first be performed on the top (latest) filter and if a negative answer is returned the next one is checked and so on. That\\'s where the added latency comes from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding an item to a Bloom filter never fails due to the data structure \\\\\\\\\\\\\"filling up\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Instead, the error rate starts to grow. To keep the error close to the one set on filter initialization, the Bloom filter will auto-scale, meaning, when capacity is reached, an additional sub-filter will be created.  \\\\\\\\n The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by `EXPANSION`. If the number of items to be stored in the filter is unknown, we recommend that you use an expansion of 2 or more to reduce the number of sub-filters. Otherwise, we recommend that you use an expansion of 1 to reduce memory consumption. The default expansion value is 2. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n The filter will keep adding more hash functions for every new sub-filter in order to keep your desired error rate. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMaybe you\\'re wondering \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why would I create a smaller filter with a high expansion rate if I know I\\'m going to scale anyway?\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; the answer is: for cases where you need to keep many filters (let\\'s say a filter per user, or per product) and most of them will stay small, but some with more activity will have to scale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you know you\\'re not going to scale use the `NONSCALING` flag because that way the filter will use one hash function less. Just remember that if you ever do reach the initially assigned capacity - your error rate will start to grow.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7903,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Reserving Bloom filters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Consider a bike manufacturer that makes a million different kinds of bikes and you\\'d like to avoid using a duplicate model name in new models.

On top of that, the value in the key also requires\\\\\\\\nRAM.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis JSON stores JSON values as binary data after deserialization. This representation is often more\\\\\\\\nexpensive, size-wise, than the serialized form. All JSON values occupy at least 8 bytes (on 64-bit architectures) because each is represented as a thin wrapper around a pointer. The type information is stored in the lower bits of the pointer, which are guaranteed to be zero due to alignment restrictions. This allows those bits to be repurposed to store some auxiliary data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor some types of JSON values, 8 bytes is all that’s needed. Nulls and booleans don’t require any additional storage. Small integers are stored in static memory because they’re frequently used, so they also use only the initial 8 bytes. Similarly, empty strings, arrays, and objects don’t require any bookkeeping. Instead, they point to static instances of a _null_ string, array, or object. Here are some examples that use the [JSON.DEBUG MEMORY]() command to report on memory consumption:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET boolean . \\'true\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY boolean\\\\\\\\n(integer) 8\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET null . null\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY null\\\\\\\\n(integer) 8\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET emptystring . \\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY emptystring\\\\\\\\n(integer) 8\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET emptyarr . \\'[]\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY emptyarr\\\\\\\\n(integer) 8\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET emptyobj . \\'{}\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY emptyobj\\\\\\\\n(integer) 8\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis RAM requirement is the same for all scalar values, but strings require additional space\\\\\\\\ndepending on their length. For example, a 3-character string will use 3 additional bytes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET foo . \\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY foo\\\\\\\\n(integer) 11\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the following four examples, each array requires 56 bytes. This breaks down as:\\\\\\\\n- 8 bytes for the initial array value pointer\\\\\\\\n- 16 bytes of metadata: 8 bytes for the allocated capacity and 8 bytes for the point-in-time size of the array\\\\\\\\n- 32 bytes for the array. The initial capacity of an array is 4. Therefore, the calculation is `4 * 8` bytes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET arr . \\'[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY arr\\\\\\\\n(integer) 56\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET arr . \\'[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY arr\\\\\\\\n(integer) 56\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET arr . \\'[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY arr\\\\\\\\n(integer) 56\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET arr . \\'[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY arr\\\\\\\\n(integer) 56\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce the current capacity is insufficient to fit a new value, the array reallocates to double its capacity. An array with 5 elements will have a capacity of 8, therefore consuming `8 + 16 + 8 * 8 = 88` bytes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.SET arr . \\'[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\'\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> JSON.DEBUG MEMORY arr\\\\\\\\n(integer) 88\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause reallocation operations can be expensive, Redis grows JSON arrays geometrically rather than linearly. This approach spreads the cost across many insertions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis table gives the size (in bytes) of a few of the test files from the [module repo](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/tree/master/tests/files), stored using\\\\\\\\nJSON.

The algorithm uses:\n\n- **Constant memory**: Only 12 KB maximum, regardless of how many unique elements you're counting\n- **Standard error rate**: Less than 1% (0.81% in Redis implementation)\n-

space)\n- `PFCOUNT`: Returns the estimated count of unique elements (O(1))\n- `PFMERGE`: Combines multiple HyperLogLogs (O(n) where n is number of HLLs)\n\n## Common use cases\n\n- Counting unique visitors to a web page (especially useful when storing IP addresses is restricted by privacy laws)\n- Tracking unique queries in a search form per day\n- Counting unique plays of songs/videos\n\nThe magic is that you get approximate uniqueness counting with minimal memory overhead—perfect for analytics at scale where exact counts aren't critical.\n\n[来源:

The Redis implementation uses up to 12 KB of memory and provides a standard error rate of 0.81%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCounting unique items usually requires an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items you want to count, because you need\\\\\\\\nto remember the elements you have already seen in the past in order to avoid\\\\\\\\ncounting them multiple times. However, a set of algorithms exist that trade \\\\\\\\nmemory for precision: they return an estimated measure with a standard error, \\\\\\\\nwhich, in the case of the Redis implementation for HyperLogLog, is less than 1%.\\\\\\\\nThe magic of this algorithm is that you no longer need to use an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items counted, and instead can use a\\\\\\\\nconstant amount of memory; 12k bytes in the worst case, or a lot less if your\\\\\\\\nHyperLogLog (We\\'ll just call them HLL from now) has seen very few elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHLLs in Redis, while technically a different data structure, are encoded\\\\\\\\nas a Redis string, so you can call [`GET`]() to serialize a HLL, and [`SET`]()\\\\\\\\nto deserialize it back to the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConceptually the HLL API is like using Sets to do the same task. You would\\\\\\\\n[`SADD`]() every observed element into a set, and would use [`SCARD`]() to check the\\\\\\\\nnumber of elements inside the set, which are unique since [`SADD`]() will not\\\\\\\\nre-add an existing element.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile you don\\'t really *add items* into an HLL, because the data structure\\\\\\\\nonly contains a state that does not include actual elements, the API is the\\\\\\\\nsame:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time you see a new element, you add it to the count with [`PFADD`]().\\\\\\\\n* When you want to retrieve the current approximation of unique elements added using the [`PFADD`]() command, you can use the [`PFCOUNT`]() command. If you need to merge two different HLLs, the [`PFMERGE`]() command is available. Since HLLs provide approximate counts of unique elements, the result of the merge will give you an approximation of the number of unique elements across both source HLLs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> PFADD bikes Hyperion Deimos Phoebe Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> PFADD commuter_bikes Salacia Mimas Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFMERGE all_bikes bikes commuter_bikes\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT all_bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome examples of use cases for this data structure is counting unique queries\\\\\\\\nperformed by users in a search form every day, number of unique visitors to a web page and other similar cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is also able to perform the union of HLLs, please check the\\\\\\\\n[full documentation]() for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Anonymous unique visits of a web page (SaaS, analytics tools)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- How many unique visits has this page had on this day? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have played this song? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have viewed this video? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nStoring the IP address or any other kind of personal identifier is against the law in some countries, which makes it impossible to get unique visitor statistics on your website.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne HyperLogLog is created per page (video/song) per period, and every IP/identifier is added to it on every visit.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6531,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Learn more\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* [`PFADD`]() adds an item to a HyperLogLog.\\\\\\\\n* [`PFCOUNT`]() returns an estimate of the number of items in the set.\\\\\\\\n* [`PFMERGE`]() combines two or more HyperLogLogs into one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of HyperLogLog commands](?group=hyperloglog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWriting ([`PFADD`]()) to and reading from ([`PFCOUNT`]()) the HyperLogLog is done in constant time and space.\\\\\\\\nMerging HLLs is O(n), where _n_ is the number of sketches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe HyperLogLog can estimate the cardinality of sets with up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (2^64) members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Redis new data structure: the HyperLogLog](http://antirez.com/news/75) has a lot of details about the data structure and its implementation in Redis.\\\\\\\\n* [Redis HyperLogLog Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MunL8nnwscQ) shows you how to use Redis HyperLogLog data structures to build a traffic heat map.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4457,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis set is an unordered collection of unique strings (members).\\\\\\\\nYou can use Redis sets to efficiently:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Track unique items (e.g., track all unique IP addresses accessing a given blog post).\\\\\\\\n* Represent relations (e.g., the set of all users with a given role).\\\\\\\\n* Perform common set operations such as intersection, unions, and differences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`SADD`]() adds a new member to a set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SREM`]() removes the specified member from the set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SISMEMBER`]() tests a string for set membership.\\\\\\\\n* [`SINTER`]() returns the set of members that two or more sets have in common (i.e., the intersection).\\\\\\\\n* [`SCARD`]() returns the size (a.k.a. cardinality) of a set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of set commands](?group=set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Store the sets of bikes racing in France and the USA.

From the `redis-cli`, run the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> RG.PYEXECUTE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GearsBuilder().run()\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis command doesn\\'t do much; it simply iterates over the keyspace. Let\\'s add a key and run it again:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> SET message \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello world\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> RG.PYEXECUTE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GearsBuilder().run()\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'event\\': None, \\'key\\': \\'message\\', \\'type\\': \\'string\\', \\'value\\': \\'hello world\\'}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ve added a single string, and you can see that this gears function processes it, even though it does nothing with the data. Let\\'s actually do something with the data. So first, we\\'ll add a few more strings:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud::6379> SET message:2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello galaxy\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> SET message:3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello universe\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe now have three strings in our database. Suppose we want to perform a unique word count on these strings. We can write a RedisGears function to do this just that. So open a file called `wordcount.py`, and add the following code:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```py\\\\\\\\ngb = GearsBuilder()\\\\\\\\ngb.map(lambda x: x[\\'value\\'])     # map each key object to its string value\\\\\\\\ngb.flatmap(lambda x: x.split())  # split each string into a list of words\\\\\\\\ngb.countby()                     # run a count-unique on these words\\\\\\\\ngb.run()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to load files into RedisGears. For production deployments, we recommend using the special [`gears-cli`](https://github.com/gears-project/gears-cli). However, for the purpose of this demonstration, the easiest way is to pass the filename through the `redis-cli` command, like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli rg.pyexecute \\\\\\\\\\\\\"`cat wordcount.py`\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'world\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'galaxy\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'hello\\', \\'value\\': 3}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'universe\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe results here show the number of occurrences of each word in all of our strings. So, we\\'ve effectively processed the data in our Redis database all at once, in a batch.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.0306,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis sorted set is a collection of unique strings (members) ordered by an associated score.\\\\\\\\nWhen more than one string has the same score, the strings are ordered lexicographically.\\\\\\\\nSome use cases for sorted sets include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Leaderboards. For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='HyperLogLog in Redis is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the cardinality (count of unique elements) of a set using a clever algorithm that trades perfect accuracy for extremely efficient memory usage.\\n\\n## How it works\\n\\nInstead of storing actual elements (which would require memory proportional to the number of items), HyperLogLog maintains only a mathematical \"state\" that allows it to estimate uniqueness.

作为消息队列的区别\n\n### 1. 数据结构实现\n\n**Lists**：\n- 基于链表（Linked Lists）实现\n- 在头部或尾部添加元素是常数时间操作 O(1)\n- 按索引访问元素较慢（需要遍历）\n- 适合实现栈和队列，以及后台任务队列管理\n\n**Streams**：\n- 使用 Radix Tree 索引实现（与 Lists 的链表结构不同）\n- 专为流式数据处理设计\n- 提供真正的流式 API（real streaming API），数据一进入就立即处理\n\n### 2. 消息处理能力\n\n**Lists**：\n- 基本命令：`LPUSH`/`RPUSH`（添加）、`LPOP`/`RPOP`（移除）、`LMOVE`（原子移动）\n- 简单的生产者-消费者模式\n- 无内置的消费者组（Consumer Group）概念\n\n**Streams**：\n- 支持消费者组（Consumer Groups）\n- 提供幂等性保证（at-most-once guarantee）\n- 新增 `IDMPAUTO` 和 `IDMP` 参数实现消息去重\n- 支持消息确认（ACK）机制\n\n### 3. 数据保留策略\n\n**Lists**：\n- 使用 `LTRIM` 按范围限制列表长度\n- 按消息数量（count）进行限制\n\n**Streams**：\n- 支持基于时间窗口的保留策略（retention policy in milliseconds）\n- 更适合时间序列场景，可以保留\"最近 N 毫秒\"的数据\n- 支持 `XTRIM` 命令和多种修剪策略（如 `DELREF`/`ACKED`）\n\n### 4. 使用场景\n\n**Lists 适合**：\n- 简单的任务队列\n- 后台 worker 系统\n- 需要快速头尾操作的场景\n\n**Streams 适合**：\n- 需要消费者组协作的场景\n- 需要消息去重和幂等性保证\n- 基于时间窗口的数据处理\n- 需要消息确认机制的可靠队列\n\n---\n\n**[来源]**：\n-

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS`

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To communicate with the Redis server, Redis clients use a protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.5467,\\\\n

For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.7263,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"21068857\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"21068857-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.6-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisos 8.6 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Open Source 8.6.0 (February 2026) > Known bugs and limitations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- Substantial performance improvements.\\\\\\\\n- Substantial memory reduction for hashes (hashtable-encoded) and sorted sets (skiplist-encoded).\\\\\\\\n- Streams: `XADD` idempotency (at-most-once guarantee) with new `IDMPAUTO` and `IDMP` arguments.\\\\\\\\n- New eviction policies -

You can operate on anything from unsigned 1-bit integers to signed 63-bit integers. These values are stored using binary-encoded Redis strings and support **atomic read, write, and increment operations**.\n\n## Key Commands\n\n- `BITFIELD` - atomically sets, increments, and reads one or more values\n- `BITFIELD_RO` - read-only variant of BITFIELD\n\n## When to Use Them\n\nBitfields are ideal for **managing counters and similar numerical values** where you need:\n\n1. **Multiple related counters in a single key** - Store several metrics together efficiently\n2. **Atomic operations** - Update multiple counters atomically in one command\n3. **Space efficiency** - Pack multiple integer values into a single Redis string\n\n## Practical Example\n\nThe documentation shows a bicycle tracking system with two 32-bit counters per bike:\n- Counter at offset 0: current price\n- Counter at offset 1: number of owners\n\n```redis\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats SET u32 #0 1000\n1) (integer) 0\n\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 -50 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 950\n2) (integer) 1\n\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 500 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats GET u32 #0 GET u32 #1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n```\n\nThis atomically updates price and owner count in a single operation, making bitfields perfect for scenarios where you need to maintain multiple related metrics per entity.\n\n**Performance**: `BITFIELD` is O(n), where n is the number of counters accessed.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitfields.md > Performance]", "tools_used": ["Grep",

Redis has special list commands to make this use case both more reliable and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example both the popular Ruby libraries [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) and\\\\\\\\n[sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) use Redis lists under the hood in order to\\\\\\\\nimplement background jobs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe popular Twitter social network [takes the latest tweets](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Real-Time-Delivery-Twitter)\\\\\\\\nposted by users into Redis lists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo describe a common use case step by step, imagine your home page shows the latest\\\\\\\\nphotos published in a photo sharing social network and you want to speedup access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time a user posts a new photo, we add its ID into a list with [`LPUSH`]().\\\\\\\\n* When users visit the home page, we use `LRANGE 0 9` in order to get the latest 10 posted items.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn many use cases we just want to use lists to store the *latest items*,\\\\\\\\nwhatever they are: social network updates, logs, or anything else.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis allows us to use lists as a capped collection, only remembering the latest\\\\\\\\nN items and discarding all the oldest items using the [`LTRIM`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`LTRIM`]() command is similar to [`LRANGE`](), but **instead of displaying the\\\\\\\\nspecified range of elements** it sets this range as the new list value. All\\\\\\\\nthe elements outside the given range are removed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you\\'re adding bikes on the end of a list of repairs, but only\\\\\\\\nwant to worry about the 3 that have been on the list the longest:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs 0 2\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above [`LTRIM`]() command tells Redis to keep just list elements from index\\\\\\\\n0 to 2, everything else will be discarded.

Here's how to store and query geospatial data:\n\n## Storing Geospatial Data\n\nUse the `GEOADD` command to add locations with their coordinates (longitude, latitude):\n\n```redis\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.27652 37.805186 station:1\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2674626 37.8062344 station:2\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2469854 37.8104049 station:3\n```\n\n**Important**: Longitude comes before latitude in this command.\n\n## Querying Geospatial Data\n\nUse `GEOSEARCH` to find locations within a radius or bounding box:\n\n```redis\nGEOSEARCH bikes:rentable FROMLONLAT -122.2612767 37.7936847 BYRADIUS 5 km WITHDIST\n```\n\nThis returns locations within 5km of the specified coordinates along with their distances:\n\n```\n1) 1) \"station:1\"\n   2) \"1.8523\"\n2) 1) \"station:2\"\n   2) \"1.4979\"\n3) 1) \"station:3\"\n   2) \"2.2441\"\n```\n\n## Use Cases\n\nGeospatial indexes are ideal for:\n- Finding nearby points within a given radius\n- Location-based searches (e.g., bike rental stations, restaurants, stores)\n- Proximity queries with distance calculations\n\n## Advanced: Geo Polygons (Redis Stack 7.2+)\n\nFor more complex shapes, Redis Stack 7.2 introduced `GEOSHAPE` field type supporting polygon queries:\n\n- Supports `POLYGON` and `POINT` shapes using WKT notation\n- Enables `WITHIN` and `CONTAINS` operations\n- Supports both cartesian (X,Y) and geographic (lon, lat) coordinate systems\n\n**Note**: The basic Geospatial data type is simpler and suitable for most use cases. For advanced format options and complex queries, consider Redis Query Engine's geospatial features.\n\n[来源: redis-docs/develop/data-types/geospatial.md]  \n[来源:

performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process. These functions can be executed on-demand, by an event-driven trigger, or by a stream processing trigger.

Geographic coordinate system using spherical indexing as default (`SPHERICAL`).\\\\\\\\n  * [#3046](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3046) Introduce performance optimization for sorting operations on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` as default on `DIALECT 4`. It will improve performance in 4 different scenarios, listed below:\\\\\\\\n    * Skip Sorter - applied when there is no sort of any kind. The query can return once it reaches the `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * Partial Range - applied when there is a `SORTBY` a numeric field, with no filter or filter by the same numeric field, the query iterate on a range large enough to satisfy the `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * Hybrid - applied when there is a `SORTBY` a numeric field in addition to another non-numeric filter. Some results will get filtered, and the initial range may not be large enough. The iterator then is rewinded with the following ranges, and an additional iteration takes place to collect `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * No optimization - If there is a sort by score or by non-numeric field, there is no other option but to retrieve all results and compare their values.\\\\\\\\n    * [#3651](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3651) Add `WITHCOUNT` argument that allow return accurate counts for the query results with sorting. This operation processes all results in order to get accurate count, being less performant than the optimised option (default behaviour on `DIALECT 4`).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **JSON**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#916](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/916) Introduce the new `JSON.MERGE` in compliance with [RFC 7396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396), supporting:\\\\\\\\n    * Creating new attributes on an existing JSON document\\\\\\\\n    * Updating and replacing values in parent and child attributes\\\\\\\\n    * Deleting existing attributes (giving `null` as value)\\\\\\\\n    * Array update - replacing an entire array with the new value.\\\\\\\\n  * [#944](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/944) Introduce `JSON.MSET`, supporting atomic multiple sets for keys in the same hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Triggers and Functions**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#875](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/875) The api_version was added to the library prologue indicating the minimum required API version. Indicating the library works on the specified API version and later minor versions.\\\\\\\\n[#896](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/896) Additional optional callback on a KeySpace trigger that can perform read operations exactly when the notification happens.\\\\\\\\n  * [#910](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/910) The JavaScript API is updated to be inline with JavaScript best practices. Registrations of functions and triggers is done with mandatory arguments and a single optional object.\\\\\\\\n  * [#935](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/935) Ability to load an RDB from a Redis Server with the RedisGears module loaded but NOT used into a Redis Server without the RedisGears module.\\\\\\\\n  * Updated commands:\\\\\\\\n    * [#910](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/910) `TFUNCTION` and `TFCALL` is used instead of `RG.FUNCTION` and `RG.FCALL`.\\\\\\\\n    * [#939](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/939) The commands are updated to match the Redis Functions commands. `TFCALL` combines the library and function in a single argument with \\'.\\' separated. Example: `TFCALL <library_name>.<function_name>`.\\\\\\\\n    * [#900](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/900) rated the ability to run functions as a coroutine in `TFCALLASYNC`. Clients rely on `TFCALL` to never block shared connections so other commands are not delayed on such connections.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n **Improvements**\\\\\\\\n* **Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#3641](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3641) Indexing sanitizing trigger in heavily data updates scenario.\\\\\\\\n  * [#3614](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3614) Several improvements in the aggregations execution pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Triggers and Functions**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#906](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/906) Limit the total memory usage of all combined libraries, the values can be configured during module load.\\\\\\\\n  * [#940](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/940) Validate the current memory usage when uploading a new library to not exceed the max memory limit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Changed Behavior**\\\\\\\\n* **Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#3355](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3355), [#3635](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3635) Expired keys deleted from slave\\'s index, returning an empty array instead of `nil`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bug Fixes**\\\\\\\\n* **Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#3597](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3597) Duplicating alias as output name on `FT.AGGREGATE` reducer (`REDUCE` argument) isn\\'t return results.\\\\\\\\n  * [#3654](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3654) Added check for `@` prefix on `GROUPBY` fields returnig an error instead of wrong results.\\\\\\\\n  * [#3501](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3501) Sorting by 2 or more fields follow the order not ignoring the second argument.\\\\\\\\n  * [#3582](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3582) Sorter will set lower rank in documents expired during query time, preventing clients to freeze.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **JSON**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#1025](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/1025) `JSON.TOGGLE` key space notification fix.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Time series**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#1471](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/1471) Potential crash on `MRANGE` when aggregating millions of time series.\\\\\\\\n  * [#1469](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/1469) Potential memory leak in `MRANGE` after eviction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Triggers and Functions**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#913](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/913) Do not trigger notifications when Redis is loading from a persistence file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis version**\\\\\\\\n* __[Redis 7.2 RC2](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.2/00-RELEASENOTES)__\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Module versions**\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n* __[RediSearch 2.8.3](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/releases/tag/v2.8.3)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisJSON 2.6.2](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/releases/tag/v2.6.2)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisTimeSeries 1.10.1](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/releases/tag/v1.10.1)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisBloom 2.6.1](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/releases/tag/v2.6.1)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisGears 2.0.6](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/releases/tag/v2.0.6-m07)__\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Recommended Client Libraries**\\\\\\\\n* Java\\\\\\\\n  * [Jedis 4.4.3 or greater](https://github.com/redis/jedis/releases/tag/v4.4.3)\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-spring 0.8.1 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-spring/releases/tag/v0.8.1)\\\\\\\\n* Python\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-py 4.5.5 or greater ](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/releases/tag/v4.5.5)\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-python 0.1.2 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-python/releases/tag/v0.1.2)\\\\\\\\n* NodeJS\\\\\\\\n  * [node-redis 4.6.7 or greater](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/releases/tag/redis%404.6.7)\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-node 0.2.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-node/releases/tag/v0.2.0)\\\\\\\\n* .NET\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-dotnet 0.5.1 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-dotnet/releases/tag/v0.5.1)\\\\\\\\n  * [NRedisStack 0.7.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/NRedisStack/releases/tag/v0.7.0)\\\\\\\\n* Go\\\\\\\\n  * [go-redis 9.0.4 or greater](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/releases/tag/v9.0.4)\\\\\\\\n  * [rueidis 1.0.3 or greater](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/releases/tag/v1.0.3)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCompatible with the latest [RedisInsight](https://redis.io/download).

服务间网络延迟追踪\n- 存储系统 IO 带宽分析\n- 应用响应时间（如 99th percentile）统计\n\n### 2. 环境与气象分析\n- 降雨量、温度、日照时长等气象数据\n- CO2 浓度长期趋势分析\n- 跨地理区域的气候数据聚合\n\n### 3. 物联网与传感器数据\n- **飞行数据记录**：高度、航迹、引擎温度、振动、压力\n- **船舶日志**：风速、海况、航速、位置\n- **车联网**：油耗、轮胎压力、加速度、位置、保养里程\n- **智能电表**：能源消耗/生产数据\n\n### 4. 金融与股票交易\n- 高频交易数据（百万级 ops/秒）\n- 价格波动分析\n- 异常检测（如内幕交易识别）\n\n### 5. 电信服务质量\n- 基站流量监控\n- 负载均衡与容量规划\n\n---\n\n## Retention（数据保留）配置\n\n### 配置优先级\nRetention 可以在三个层级设置，优先级从高到低：\n\n1. **Key 级别**：通过 `TS.CREATE` 或 `TS.ALTER` 的 `RETENTION` 参数\n2. **全局配置**：`ts-retention-policy` 配置参数\n3. **无保留策略**（默认）\n\n### 配置方法\n\n#### Redis 8.0 之前（启动时加载）\n```bash\nredis-server --loadmodule ./redistimeseries.so RETENTION_POLICY 25920000000\n```\n\n#### Redis 8.0 及以上（运行时配置）\n```bash\n# 设置默认保留 300 天（25920000000 毫秒）\nredis> CONFIG SET ts-retention-policy 25920000000\n\n# 持久化到配置文件\nredis> CONFIG REWRITE\n```\n\n#### Key 级别示例\n```bash\n# 创建时指定保留 60 秒\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\n```\n\n###

infrastructure (servers and networks) and software systems (applications and services) that need to be monitored around the clock.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Time Series allows you to plan for new resources upfront, optimize the utilization of existing resources, reconstruct the circumstances that led to outages, and identify application performance issues by analyzing and reporting on the following metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Maximum CPU utilization per server\\\\\\\\n- Maximum network latency between two services\\\\\\\\n- Average IO bandwidth utilization of a storage system\\\\\\\\n- 99th percentile of the response time of a specific application outages\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Weather analysis (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Time Series can be used to track environmental measurements such as the number of daily sunshine hours and hourly rainfall depth, over a period of many years. Seasonally, you can measure average rainfall depth, average daily temperature, and the maximum number of sunny hours per day, for example. Watch the increase of the maximum daily temperature over the years. Predict the expected temperature and rainfall depth in a specific location for a particular week of the year.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultiple time series can be collected, each for a different location. By utilizing secondary indexes, measurements can be aggregated over given geographical regions (e.g., minimal and maximal daily temperature in Europe) or over locations with specific attributes (e.g., average rainfall depth in mountainous regions).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample metrics include: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Rain (cm)\\\\\\\\n- Temperature (C)\\\\\\\\n- Sunny periods (h)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Analysis of the atmosphere (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe atmospheric concentration of CO2 is more important than ever before. Use TimeSeries to track average, maximum and minimum CO2 level per season and average yearly CO2 over the last decades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Concentration of CO2 (ppm)\\\\\\\\n- Location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Flight data recording (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlanes have a multitude of sensors. This sensor data is stored in a black box and also shared with external systems. TimeSeries can help you reconstruct the sequence of events over time, optimize operations and maintenance intervals, improve safety, and provide feedback to the equipment manufacturers about the part quality. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Altitude\\\\\\\\n- Flight path\\\\\\\\n- Engine temperature\\\\\\\\n- Level of vibrations\\\\\\\\n- Pressure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ship logbooks (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s very common to keep track of ship voyages via (digital) logbooks. Use TimeSeries to calculate optimal routes using these metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Wind (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Ocean conditions (classes)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (knots)\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Connected car (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern cars are exposing several metrics via a standard interface. Use TimeSeries to correlate average fuel consumption with the tire pressure, figure out how long to keep a car in the fleet, determine optimal maintenance intervals, and calculate tax savings by type of the road (taxable vs. nontaxable roads). Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Acceleration\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n- Fuel level (liter)\\\\\\\\n- Distances (km)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Tire pressure\\\\\\\\n- Distance until next maintenance check\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Smart metering (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern houses and facilities gather details about energy consumption/production. Use Redis Time Series to aggregate billing based on monthly consumption. Optimize the network by redirecting the energy delivery relative to the fluctuations in need. Provide recommendations on how to improve the energy consumption behavior. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Consumption per location\\\\\\\\n- Produced amount of electrical energy per location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Quality of service (telecom)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMobile phone usage is increasing, producing a natural growth that just correlates to the increasing number of cellphones. However, there might also be spikes that correlate with specific events (for example, more messages around world championships). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTelecom providers need to ensure that they are providing the necessary infrastructure to deliver the right quality of service. This includes using mini towers for short-term peaks. Use TimeSeries to correlate traffic peaks to specific events, load balance traffic over several towers or mini towers, and predictively plan the infrastructure. Metrics include the amount of traffic per tower.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Stock trading (finance)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStock trading is highly automated today. Algorithms, and not just human beings, are trading, from the amount of bids and asks for the trading of a stock to the extreme volumes of trades per second (millions of ops per second). Computer-driven trading requires millisecond response times. It\\'s necessary to keep a lot of data points within a very short period of time (for example, price fluctuations per second within a minute). In addition, the long-term history needs to be kept to make statements about trends or for regulatory purposes.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse Redis Time Series to identify correlations between the trading behavior and other events (for example, social network posts). Discover a developing market. Detect anomalies to discover insider trades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Exact time and order of a trade by itself\\\\\\\\n- Type of the event (trade/bid)\\\\\\\\n- The stock price\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7569,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redistimeseries 1.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.0.0 (June 2019) > Features > Integrations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If you want to keep all of your raw data points indefinitely, your data set will grow linearly over time. However, if your use case allows you to have less fine-grained data further back in time, downsampling can be applied. This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function. RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using Redis’ core data structures, you can only retrieve a time series by knowing the exact key holding the time series. Unfortunately, for many time series use cases (such as root cause analysis or monitoring), your application won’t know the exact key it’s looking for. These use cases typically want to query a set of time series that relate to each other in a couple of dimensions to extract the insight you need. You could create your own secondary index with core Redis data structures to help with this, but it would come with a high development cost and require you to manage edge cases to make sure the index is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries does this indexing for you based on `field value` pairs (a.k.a labels) you can add to each time series, and use to filter at query time (a full list of these filters is available in our documentation). Here’s an example of creating a time series with two labels (sensor_id and area_id are the fields with values 2 and 32 respectively) and a retention window of 60,000 milliseconds:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to query a time series, it’s cumbersome to stream all raw data points if you’re only interested in, say, an average over a given time interval. RedisTimeSeries follows the Redis philosophy to only transfer the minimum required data to ensure lowest latency. Below is an example of aggregation query over time buckets of 5,000 milliseconds with an aggregation function:  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.RANGE temperature:3:32 1548149180000 1548149210000 AGGREGATION avg 5000\\\\\\\\n1) 1) (integer) 1548149180000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"26.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) 1) (integer) 1548149185000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"27.399999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) 1) (integer) 1548149190000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"24.800000000000001\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) 1) (integer) 1548149195000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"23.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) 1) (integer) 1548149200000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"25.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) 1) (integer) 1548149205000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"28\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n7) 1) (integer) 1548149210000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"20\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries comes with several integrations into existing time series tools. One such integration is our [RedisTimeSeries adapter for Prometheus](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-redistimeseries-adapter), which keeps all your monitoring metrics inside RedisTimeSeries while leveraging the entire Prometheus ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, we also created direct integration for [Grafana](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/grafana-redistimeseries). [This repository](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-demos) contains a docker-compose setup of RedisTimeSeries, its remote write adaptor, Prometheus and Grafana. It also comes with a set of data generators and pre-built Grafana dashboards.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.3689,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b-005\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples > Capped lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Lists are useful for a number of tasks, two very representative use cases\\\\\\\\nare the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Remember the latest updates posted by users into a social network.\\\\\\\\n* Communication between processes, using a consumer-producer pattern where the producer pushes items into a list, and a consumer (usually a *worker*) consumes those items and executes actions. Redis has special list commands to make this use case both more reliable and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example both the popular Ruby libraries [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) and\\\\\\\\n[sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) use Redis lists under the hood in order to\\\\\\\\nimplement background jobs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe popular Twitter social network [takes the latest tweets](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Real-Time-Delivery-Twitter)\\\\\\\\nposted by users into Redis lists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo describe a common use case step by step, imagine your home page shows the latest\\\\\\\\nphotos published in a photo sharing social network and you want to speedup access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time a user posts a new photo, we add its ID into a list with [`LPUSH`]().\\\\\\\\n* When users visit the home page, we use `LRANGE 0 9` in order to get the latest 10 posted items.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn many use cases we just want to use lists to store the *latest items*,\\\\\\\\nwhatever they are: social network updates, logs, or anything else.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis allows us to use lists as a capped collection, only remembering the latest\\\\\\\\nN items and discarding all the oldest items using the [`LTRIM`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`LTRIM`]() command is similar to [`LRANGE`](), but **instead of displaying the\\\\\\\\nspecified range of elements** it sets this range as the new list value. All\\\\\\\\nthe elements outside the given range are removed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you\\'re adding bikes on the end of a list of repairs, but only\\\\\\\\nwant to worry about the 3 that have been on the list the longest:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs 0 2\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above [`LTRIM`]() command tells Redis to keep just list elements from index\\\\\\\\n0 to 2, everything else will be discarded. This allows for a very simple but\\\\\\\\nuseful pattern: doing a List push operation + a List trim operation together \\\\\\\\nto add a new element and discard elements exceeding a limit. Using \\\\\\\\n[`LTRIM`]() with negative indexes can then be used to keep only the 3 most recently added:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs -3 -1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above combination adds new elements and keeps only the 3\\\\\\\\nnewest elements into the list. With [`LRANGE`]() you can access the top items\\\\\\\\nwithout any need to remember very old data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: while [`LRANGE`]() is technically an O(N) command, accessing small ranges\\\\\\\\ntowards the head or the tail of the list is a constant time operation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.3259,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redistimeseries 1.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.0.0 (June 2019) > Features\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In RedisTimeSeries, we are introducing a new data type that uses chunks of memory of fixed size for time series samples, indexed by the same [Radix Tree implementation](https://github.com/antirez/rax) as Redis Streams.

This means that the last elected master dataset eventually replaces all the other replicas. There is always a window of time when it is possible to lose writes during partitions. However these windows are very different in the case of a client that is connected to the majority of masters, and a client that is connected to the minority of masters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster tries harder to retain writes that are performed by clients connected to the majority of masters, compared to writes performed in the minority side.\\\\\\\\nThe following are examples of scenarios that lead to loss of acknowledged\\\\\\\\nwrites received in the majority partitions during failures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A write may reach a master, but while the master may be able to reply to the client, the write may not be propagated to replicas via the asynchronous replication used between master and replica nodes. If the master dies without the write reaching the replicas, the write is lost forever if the master is unreachable for a long enough period that one of its replicas is promoted. This is usually hard to observe in the case of a total, sudden failure of a master node since masters try to reply to clients (with the acknowledge of the write) and replicas (propagating the write) at about the same time. However it is a real world failure mode.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Another theoretically possible failure mode where writes are lost is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A master is unreachable because of a partition.\\\\\\\\n* It gets failed over by one of its replicas.\\\\\\\\n* After some time it may be reachable again.\\\\\\\\n* A client with an out-of-date routing table may write to the old master before it is converted into a replica (of the new master) by the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second failure mode is unlikely to happen because master nodes unable to communicate with the majority of the other masters for enough time to be failed over will no longer accept writes, and when the partition is fixed writes are still refused for a small amount of time to allow other nodes to inform about configuration changes. This failure mode also requires that the client\\'s routing table has not yet been updated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWrites targeting the minority side of a partition have a larger window in which to get lost. For example, Redis Cluster loses a non-trivial number of writes on partitions where there is a minority of masters and at least one or more clients, since all the writes sent to the masters may potentially get lost if the masters are failed over in the majority side.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, for a master to be failed over it must be unreachable by the majority of masters for at least `NODE_TIMEOUT`, so if the partition is fixed before that time, no writes are lost. When the partition lasts for more than `NODE_TIMEOUT`, all the writes performed in the minority side up to that point may be lost. However the minority side of a Redis Cluster will start refusing writes as soon as `NODE_TIMEOUT` time has elapsed without contact with the majority, so there is a maximum window after which the minority becomes no longer available. Hence, no writes are accepted or lost after that time.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_MjOtdCNL9YPOBO370L4yLP', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7623,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"608370db\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"608370db-009\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/timeseries/configuration.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration Parameters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Time series configuration parameters > RETENTION_POLICY / ts-retention-policy > Example\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Because the retention can be provided at different levels, the actual precedence of the retention is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

However, if your use case allows you to have less fine-grained data further back in time, downsampling can be applied. This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function. RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using Redis’ core data structures, you can only retrieve a time series by knowing the exact key holding the time series. Unfortunately, for many time series use cases (such as root cause analysis or monitoring), your application won’t know the exact key it’s looking for. These use cases typically want to query a set of time series that relate to each other in a couple of dimensions to extract the insight you need. You could create your own secondary index with core Redis data structures to help with this, but it would come with a high development cost and require you to manage edge cases to make sure the index is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries does this indexing for you based on `field value` pairs (a.k.a labels) you can add to each time series, and use to filter at query time (a full list of these filters is available in our documentation). Here’s an example of creating a time series with two labels (sensor_id and area_id are the fields with values 2 and 32 respectively) and a retention window of 60,000 milliseconds:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to query a time series, it’s cumbersome to stream all raw data points if you’re only interested in, say, an average over a given time interval. RedisTimeSeries follows the Redis philosophy to only transfer the minimum required data to ensure lowest latency. Below is an example of aggregation query over time buckets of 5,000 milliseconds with an aggregation function:  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.RANGE temperature:3:32 1548149180000 1548149210000 AGGREGATION avg 5000\\\\\\\\n1) 1) (integer) 1548149180000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"26.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) 1) (integer) 1548149185000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"27.399999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) 1) (integer) 1548149190000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"24.800000000000001\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) 1) (integer) 1548149195000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"23.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) 1) (integer) 1548149200000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"25.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) 1) (integer) 1548149205000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"28\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n7) 1) (integer) 1548149210000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"20\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries comes with several integrations into existing time series tools. One such integration is our [RedisTimeSeries adapter for Prometheus](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-redistimeseries-adapter), which keeps all your monitoring metrics inside RedisTimeSeries while leveraging the entire Prometheus ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, we also created direct integration for [Grafana](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/grafana-redistimeseries).

"passed", "elapsed_seconds": 177.85174441337585, "cost_usd": 0.0663985, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 3424, "answer": "Based on the search results from the Redis knowledge base, here's a comparison of Count-Min Sketch and Top-K probabilistic data structures:\n\n## Overview\n\nBoth are probabilistic data structures in Redis for analyzing data streams, but they serve different purposes:\n\n- **Count-Min Sketch (CMS)**: Estimates the frequency/count of elements in a stream\n- **Top-K**: Identifies the K highest-frequency elements in a stream\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### Purpose & Use Case\n\n**Count-Min Sketch:**\n- Answers: \"How many times has element X appeared?\"\n- Best for: Tracking frequency of ALL elements when you need counts above a certain threshold\n- Example: Sales volume tracking where you want counts for products contributing most to sales\n\n**Top-K:**\n- Answers: \"What are the K most frequent elements?\"\n- Best for: Finding the top performers/heavy hitters in real-time\n- Example: Detecting network anomalies, trending hashtags, most-read news articles\n\n### Algorithm & Implementation\n\n**Count-Min Sketch:**\n- Uses a 2D array of counters with multiple hash functions (depth)\n- Each element hashes to multiple positions; increment all counters\n- Query returns the minimum of all hashed positions\n- Only useful for **higher counts** - low counts should be ignored as noise\n\n**Top-K:**\n- Based on the [HeavyKeepers algorithm](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong)\n- Uses two structures in tandem:\n  - Hash table with probabilistic counts (similar to CMS)\n  - Min heap holding the K items with highest counts\n- Uses \"count-with-exponential-decay\" strategy biased against small flows\n- Provides real-time notifications when elements enter/leave the top-K list\n\n### Performance Characteristics\n\n**Count-Min Sketch:**\n- Space: Sub-linear, determined by error rate and probability parameters\n- Accuracy: Over-counts due to collisions; threshold = error × total_count\n- Best when: You need counts for many elements with non-uniform distribution\n\n**Top-K:**\n- Space: Fraction of what a Sorted Set would require\n- Time: `O(K*log(k))` for listing top-K items\n- Accuracy: Higher than previous probabilistic algorithms\n- Best when: K is small and you only care about the top performers\n\n### Overlap & When to Use Each\n\nThe documentation explicitly notes: \"There is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases.\"\n\n**Use Count-Min Sketch when:**\n- You need frequency estimates for arbitrary elements\n- You're tracking many elements but only care about high-frequency ones\n- You have non-uniform distribution (some heavy hitters, many low-frequency items)\n\n**Use Top-K when:**\n- You only need to know the top K elements\n- You need real-time updates when top-K membership changes\n- You want better performance for small K values\n- You need to detect sudden spikes (DDoS attacks, trending topics)\n\n## Example Commands\n\n**Count-Min Sketch:**\n```redis\nCMS.INITBYPROB bikes:profit 0.001 0.002\nCMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \"Mountain Bike\" 100\nCMS.QUERY bikes:profit \"Mountain Bike\"\n```\n\n**Top-K:**\n```redis\nTOPK.RESERVE trending:hashtags 10\nTOPK.ADD trending:hashtags \"#redis\"\nTOPK.LIST trending:hashtags\n```\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/top-k.md > Use

score can be a count of how many times the element has appeared in the stream - thus making the data structure perfect for finding the elements with the highest frequency in a stream.\\\\\\\\nOne very common application is detecting network anomalies and DDoS attacks where Top K can answer the question: Is there a sudden increase in the flux of requests to the same address or from the same IP?\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Open Source implementation of Top-K is based on the [HeavyKeepers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong) algorithm presented by Junzhi Gong et al. It discards some older approaches like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"count-all\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"admit-all-count-some\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in favour of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**count-with-exponential-decay**\\\\\\\\\\\\\" strategy which is biased against mouse (small) flows and has a limited impact on elephant (large) flows. This implementation uses two data structures in tandem: a hash table that holds the probabilistic counts (much like the Count-Min Sketch), and a min heap that holds the `K` items with the highest counts. This ensures high accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms allowed, while keeping memory utilization to a fraction of what is typically required by a Sorted Set. It has the additional benefit of being able to get real time notifications when elements are added or removed from the Top K list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trending hashtags (social media platforms, news distribution networks)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What are the K hashtags people have mentioned the most in the last X hours? \\\\\\\\n- What are the K news with highest read/view count today? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData flow is the incoming social media posts from which you parse out the different hashtags. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`TOPK.LIST`]() command has a time complexity of `O(K*log(k))` so if `K` is small, there is no need to keep a separate set or sorted set of all the hashtags. You can query directly from the Top K itself.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.4181,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/count-min-sketch.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-min sketch\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-Min Sketch is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Open Source that can be used to estimate the frequency of events/elements in a stream of data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt uses a sub-linear space at the expense of over-counting some events due to collisions. It consumes a stream of events/elements and keeps estimated counters of their frequency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is very important to know that the results coming from a Count-Min sketch lower than a certain threshold (determined by the error_rate) should be ignored and often even approximated to zero. So Count-Min sketch is indeed a data-structure for counting frequencies of elements in a stream, but it\\'s only useful for higher counts.

Products with low percentage of the total sales are ignored.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAssume you select an error rate of 0.1% (0.001) with a certainty of 99.8% (0.998). This means you have an error probability of 0.02% (0.002). Your sketch strives to keep the error within 0.1% of the total count of all elements you\\'ve added. There\\'s a 0.02% chance the error might exceed this—like when an element below the threshold overlaps with one above it. When you add a few items to the CMS and evaluate their frequency, remember that in such a small sample, collisions are rare, as seen with other probabilistic data structures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INITBYPROB bikes:profit 0.001 0.002\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 100\\\\\\\\n(integer) 100\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 200 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 150\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n> CMS.QUERY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Terrible Bike Name\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 100\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INFO bikes:profit\\\\\\\\n1) width\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 2000\\\\\\\\n3) depth\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 9\\\\\\\\n5) count\\\\\\\\n6) (integer) 450\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7685,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/count-min-sketch.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-min sketch\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sizing > 2.

If a result is below it - it can be discarded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`probability` in this data structure represents the chance of an element that has a count below the threshold to collide with elements that had a count above the threshold on all sketches/depths thus returning a min-count of a frequently occurring element instead of its own.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.0579,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"49a1af21\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"49a1af21-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisos 8.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Open Source 8.0.0 (May 2025) > Security fixes (compared to 8.0-RC1)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- Name change: Redis Community Edition is now Redis Open Source\\\\\\\\n- License change: licensed under your choice of \\\\\\\\n  - (a) the Redis Source Available License 2.0 (RSALv2); or\\\\\\\\n  - (b) the Server Side Public License v1 (SSPLv1); or\\\\\\\\n  - (c) the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3)\\\\\\\\n- Redis Query Engine and 8 new data structures are now an integral part of Redis 8.\\\\\\\\n  - (1) Redis Query Engine, which now supports both horizontal and vertical scaling for search, query, and vector workloads.\\\\\\\\n  - (2) JSON, a queryable JSON document data type.\\\\\\\\n  - (3) Time series.\\\\\\\\n  - (4-8) Five probabilistic data structures: Bloom filter, Cuckoo filter, Count-min sketch, Top-k, and t-digest.\\\\\\\\n  - (9) Vector set [preview], a data structure designed for vector similarity search, inspired by sorted set.\\\\\\\\n  - These nine components are included in all binary distributions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  - See the [build instructions]() for information about building from source code.\\\\\\\\n  - New configuration file: `redis-full.conf`, loads Redis with all components, \\\\\\\\n    and contains new configuration parameters for Redis Query Engine and the new data structures.\\\\\\\\n  - New ACL categories: `@search`, `@json`, `@timeseries`, `@bloom`, `@cuckoo`, `@cms`, `@topk`, and `@tdigest` commands are also included in the existing ACL categories such as `@read` and `@write`.

It can be used to answer the following questions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What fraction of the values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- How many values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- Which value is smaller than _p_ percent of the values in the data stream? (what is the _p_-percentile value)?\\\\\\\\n- What is the mean value between the _p1_-percentile value and the _p2_-percentile value?\\\\\\\\n- What is the value of the _n_-th smallest / largest value in the data stream? (what is the value with [reverse] rank _n_)?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs for any other probabilistic data structures, t-digest requires sublinear space and has controllable space-accuracy tradeoffs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing t-digest is simple and straightforward:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Creating a sketch and adding observations**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.CREATE key [COMPRESSION compression]` initializes a new t-digest sketch (and errors if the key already exists). The `COMPRESSION` argument is used to specify the tradeoff between accuracy and memory consumption. The default is 100. Higher values mean more accuracy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.ADD key value...` adds new observations (floating-point values) to the sketch. You can repeat calling [TDIGEST.ADD]() whenever new observations are available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating fractions or ranks by values**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.CDF key value...` to retrieve, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **fraction** of (observations **smaller** than the given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.RANK key value...` is similar to [TDIGEST.CDF](), but used for estimating the number of observations instead of the fraction of observations. More accurately it returns, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **number** of (observations **smaller** than a given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  And lastly, `TDIGEST.REVRANK key value...` is similar to [TDIGEST.RANK](), but returns, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **number** of (observations **larger** than a given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating values by fractions or ranks**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.QUANTILE key fraction...` returns, for each input **fraction**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) that is **smaller** than the given fraction of observations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.BYRANK key rank...` returns, for each input **rank**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) with that rank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.BYREVRANK key rank...` returns, for each input **reverse rank**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) with that reverse rank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating trimmed mean**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.TRIMMED_MEAN key lowFraction highFraction` to retrieve an estimation of the mean value between the specified fractions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  This is especially useful for calculating the average value ignoring outliers. For example, calculating the average value between the 20th percentile and the 80th percentile.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Merging sketches**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Sometimes it is useful to merge sketches. For example, suppose we measure latencies for 3 servers, and we want to calculate the 90%, 95%, and 99% latencies for all the servers combined.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.MERGE destKey numKeys sourceKey... [COMPRESSION compression] [OVERRIDE]` merges multiple sketches into a single sketch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  If `destKey` does not exist, a new sketch is created.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  If `destKey` is an existing sketch, its values are merged with the values of the source keys. To override the destination key contents, use `OVERRIDE`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Retrieving sketch information**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.MIN` key and `TDIGEST.MAX key` to retrieve the minimal and maximal values in the sketch, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Both return NaN (Not a Number) when the sketch is empty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Both commands return accurate results and are equivalent to `TDIGEST.BYRANK key 0` and `TDIGEST.BYREVRANK key 0` respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.INFO key` to retrieve some additional information about the sketch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Resetting a sketch**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.RESET key` empties the sketch and reinitializes it.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6481,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Use cases\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the cardinality of a set, trading perfect accuracy for efficient space utilization.

If you need to merge two different HLLs, the [`PFMERGE`]() command is available.

Here's how it works:\n\n## Failover Process\n\n**1. Failure Detection**\n- Multiple Sentinel processes continuously monitor Redis masters\n- When a master becomes unreachable, Sentinels must reach consensus before triggering failover\n- A configurable **quorum** determines how many Sentinels need to agree that the master is down\n- The master is marked as **ODOWN** (Objectively Down) when the quorum is reached\n\n**2. Authorization & Leader Election**\n- After ODOWN is triggered, one Sentinel must be elected as the failover leader\n- The leader Sentinel must get authorization from a **majority** of all Sentinels (not just the quorum)\n- This prevents failovers in network partitions where only a minority of Sentinels exist\n\n**3. Replica Selection**\nThe failover leader selects a new master from available replicas based on:\n1. **Disconnection time** - Replicas disconnected for too long are excluded\n2. **Replica priority** - Lower `replica-priority` values are preferred\n3. **Replication offset** - Replicas with more data from the master are preferred\n4. **Run ID** - Lexicographically smaller run ID as a tiebreaker\n\n**4. Promotion & Reconfiguration**\n- The selected replica is promoted to master\n- Other replicas are reconfigured to replicate from the new master\n- Sentinel updates its configuration and notifies clients of the new master address\n\n## Key Safety Features\n\n- **No split-brain**: Failover only proceeds with majority approval, preventing multiple masters\n- **Tunable sensitivity**: Quorum < majority = faster failover; quorum > majority = more conservative\n- **Client discovery**: Clients query Sentinels for the current master address, automatically adapting to topology changes\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Sentinel as a distributed system, Quorum, Replica selection and priority]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "failover", "master", "replication", "replica", "monitor", "OBJECT", "MULTI"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "9207cce3-707a-4609-accf-29b9ccf4bf61", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "dcd3f9a4-f07e-4cf0-86b7-44a3044ec9d2", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Redis Sentinel's automatic failover handling.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_HnlRea43iHBGQ2lEexynuk', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Sentinel automatic failover process', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_En1ZoikJToKtFXAJHYVr7z', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'Sentinel.*failover|automatic failover'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_HnlRea43iHBGQ2lEexynuk', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.726,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis service discovery via Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel is a monitoring solution for Redis instances that handles\\\\\\\\nautomatic failover of Redis masters and service discovery (who is the current\\\\\\\\nmaster for a given group of instances?).

Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties. In this document concepts will be introduced gradually\\\\\\\\nstarting from basic information needed in order to understand the basic\\\\\\\\nproperties of Sentinel, to more complex information (that are optional) in\\\\\\\\norder to understand how exactly Sentinel works.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8874,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-025\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Algorithms and internals > Quorum\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The previous sections showed that every master monitored by Sentinel is associated to a configured **quorum**. It specifies the number of Sentinel processes\\\\\\\\nthat need to agree about the unreachability or error condition of the master in\\\\\\\\norder to trigger a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, after the failover is triggered, in order for the failover to actually be performed, **at least a majority of Sentinels must authorize the Sentinel to\\\\\\\\nfailover**. Sentinel never performs a failover in the partition where a\\\\\\\\nminority of Sentinels exist.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s try to make things a bit more clear:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Quorum: the number of Sentinel processes that need to detect an error condition in order for a master to be flagged as **ODOWN**.\\\\\\\\n* The failover is triggered by the **ODOWN** state.\\\\\\\\n* Once the failover is triggered, the Sentinel trying to failover is required to ask for authorization to a majority of Sentinels (or more than the majority if the quorum is set to a number greater than the majority).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe difference may seem subtle but is actually quite simple to understand and use.  For example if you have 5 Sentinel instances, and the quorum is set to 2, a failover will be triggered as soon as 2 Sentinels believe that the master is not reachable, however one of the two Sentinels will be able to failover only if it gets authorization at least from 3 Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf instead the quorum is configured to 5, all the Sentinels must agree about the master error condition, and the authorization from all Sentinels is required in order to failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that the quorum can be used to tune Sentinel in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. If a quorum is set to a value smaller than the majority of Sentinels we deploy, we are basically making Sentinel more sensitive to master failures, triggering a failover as soon as even just a minority of Sentinels is no longer able to talk with the master.\\\\\\\\n2. If a quorum is set to a value greater than the majority of Sentinels, we are making Sentinel able to failover only when there are a very large number (larger than majority) of well connected Sentinels which agree about the master being down.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.5916,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-023\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > Replica selection and priority\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When a Sentinel instance is ready to perform a failover, since the master\\\\\\\\nis in `ODOWN` state and the Sentinel received the authorization to failover\\\\\\\\nfrom the majority of the Sentinel instances known, a suitable replica needs\\\\\\\\nto be selected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe replica selection process evaluates the following information about replicas:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Disconnection time from the master.\\\\\\\\n2. Replica priority.\\\\\\\\n3. Replication offset processed.\\\\\\\\n4.

The replicas are sorted by `replica-priority` as configured in the `redis.conf` file of the Redis instance. A lower priority will be preferred.\\\\\\\\n2. If the priority is the same, the replication offset processed by the replica is checked, and the replica that received more data from the master is selected.\\\\\\\\n3. If multiple replicas have the same priority and processed the same data from the master, a further check is performed, selecting the replica with the lexicographically smaller run ID. Having a lower run ID is not a real advantage for a replica, but is useful in order to make the process of replica selection more deterministic, instead of resorting to select a random replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most cases, `replica-priority` does not need to be set explicitly so all\\\\\\\\ninstances will use the same default value. If there is a particular fail-over\\\\\\\\npreference, `replica-priority` must be set on all instances, including masters,\\\\\\\\nas a master may become a replica at some future point in time - and it will then\\\\\\\\nneed the proper `replica-priority` settings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis instance can be configured with a special `replica-priority` of zero\\\\\\\\nin order to be **never selected** by Sentinels as the new master.\\\\\\\\nHowever a replica configured in this way will still be reconfigured by\\\\\\\\nSentinels in order to replicate with the new master after a failover, the\\\\\\\\nonly difference is that it will never become a master itself.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.5687,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel quick start > Configuring Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis source distribution contains a file called `sentinel.conf`\\\\\\\\nthat is a self-documented example configuration file you can use to\\\\\\\\nconfigure Sentinel, however a typical minimal configuration file looks like the\\\\\\\\nfollowing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2\\\\\\\\n    sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 60000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor resque 192.168.1.3 6380 4\\\\\\\\n    sentinel down-after-milliseconds resque 10000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel failover-timeout resque 180000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel parallel-syncs resque 5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou only need to specify the masters to monitor, giving to each separated\\\\\\\\nmaster (that may have any number of replicas) a different name. There is no\\\\\\\\nneed to specify replicas, which are auto-discovered. Sentinel will update the\\\\\\\\nconfiguration automatically with additional information about replicas (in\\\\\\\\norder to retain the information in case of restart). The configuration is\\\\\\\\nalso rewritten every time a replica is promoted to master during a failover\\\\\\\\nand every time a new Sentinel is discovered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe example configuration above basically monitors two sets of Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances, each composed of a master and an undefined number of replicas.\\\\\\\\nOne set of instances is called `mymaster`, and the other `resque`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe meaning of the arguments of `sentinel monitor` statements is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <port> <quorum>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the sake of clarity, let\\'s check line by line what the configuration\\\\\\\\noptions mean:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first line is used to tell Redis to monitor a master called *mymaster*,\\\\\\\\nthat is at address 127.0.0.1 and port 6379, with a quorum of 2. Everything\\\\\\\\nis pretty obvious but the **quorum** argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The **quorum** is the number of Sentinels that need to agree about the fact the master is not reachable, in order to really mark the master as failing, and eventually start a failover procedure if possible.\\\\\\\\n* However **the quorum is only used to detect the failure**. In order to actually perform a failover, one of the Sentinels need to be elected leader for the failover and be authorized to proceed. This only happens with the vote of the **majority of the Sentinel processes**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example if you have 5 Sentinel processes, and the quorum for a given\\\\\\\\nmaster set to the value of 2, this is what happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If two Sentinels agree at the same time about the master being unreachable, one of the two will try to start a failover.\\\\\\\\n* If there are at least a total of three Sentinels reachable, the failover will be authorized and will actually start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn practical terms this means during failures **Sentinel never starts a failover if the majority of Sentinel processes are unable to talk** (aka no failover in the minority partition).\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_En1ZoikJToKtFXAJHYVr7z', content='Found 2 files\\ndocs/eval-review.md\\ndocs/runbook/redis-failover.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Redis Sentinel handles automatic failover through a distributed consensus mechanism.

169.55514430999756, "cost_usd": 0.07328475, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 1658, "answer": "根据检索结果，我来详细解答 Redis Cluster 的数据分片和 hash slot 机制：\n\n## Redis Cluster 数据分片机制\n\n### Hash Slot 核心概念\n\nRedis Cluster 将整个键空间分为 **16384 个 hash slots（哈希槽）**，每个 master 节点负责其中一部分 hash slots。\n\n**分片算法：**\n```\nHASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\n```\n\n使用 CRC16（XMODEM 变体）对 key 进行哈希计算，然后对 16384 取模得到 hash slot 编号。\n\n### 分片示例\n\n假设有 3 个节点的集群：\n- **Node A**: 负责 hash slots 0-5500\n- **Node B**: 负责 hash slots 5501-11000  \n- **Node C**: 负责 hash slots 11001-16383\n\n当客户端访问某个 key 时，先计算其 hash slot，然后路由到对应的节点。\n\n### Hash Tags（哈希标签）\n\n为了支持多键操作，Redis Cluster 提供了 hash tags 机制：\n\n**规则：** 如果 key 中包含 `{...}` 模式，只对花括号内的内容进行哈希计算。\n\n**示例：**\n- `{user:1000}.name` 和 `{user:1000}.followers` → 只哈希 `user:1000`，保证在同一 hash slot\n- `user:{123}:profile` 和 `user:{123}:account` → 只哈希 `123`，可以执行多键操作\n\n这样可以确保相关的 keys 分配到同一个 hash slot，支持 `MSET`、`SINTER` 等多键命令。\n\n## 动态扩缩容（Resharding）\n\nRedis Cluster 支持在线迁移 hash slots，无需停机：\n\n**添加节点：** 从现有节点移动部分 hash slots 到新节点  \n**删除节点：** 将该节点的 hash slots 迁移到其他节点  \n**重平衡：** 在节点间移动 hash slots 调整负载\n\n**迁移过程：**\n1. 设置源节点 slot 为 `MIGRATING` 状态\n2. 设置目标节点 slot 为 `IMPORTING` 状态\n3. 使用 `MIGRATE` 命令逐个迁移 keys\n4. 完成后更新 slot 映射表\n\n迁移期间：\n- 已存在的 keys 继续在源节点处理\n- 新 keys 写入目标节点\n- 客户端通过 `-ASK` 重定向访问迁移中的 keys\n\n## 配置传播机制\n\n集群使用 **gossip 协议** 传播 hash slot 配置：\n\n1. **心跳消息：** 每个节点在 ping/pong 包中携带自己负责的 hash slots 信息\n2. **UPDATE 消息：** 当检测到配置过期时，发送更新消息强制同步\n3. **configEpoch：** 使用配置纪元保证一致性，更高 epoch 的配置会覆盖旧配置\n\n**\"Last failover wins\"** 原则：最终所有节点会同意 configEpoch 最大的节点拥有该 slot。\n\n---\n\n**[来源: cluster-spec.md > Key distribution model]**  \n**[来源: cluster-spec.md > Live reconfiguration]**  \n**[来源: scaling.md > Redis Cluster master-replica model]**  \n**[来源:

ability to add and remove nodes while the cluster\\\\\\\\nis running. Adding or removing a node is abstracted into the same\\\\\\\\noperation: moving a hash slot from one node to another. This means\\\\\\\\nthat the same basic mechanism can be used in order to rebalance the cluster, add\\\\\\\\nor remove nodes, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To add a new node to the cluster an empty node is added to the cluster and some set of hash slots are moved from existing nodes to the new node.\\\\\\\\n* To remove a node from the cluster the hash slots assigned to that node are moved to other existing nodes.\\\\\\\\n* To rebalance the cluster a given set of hash slots are moved between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe core of the implementation is the ability to move hash slots around.\\\\\\\\nFrom a practical point of view a hash slot is just a set of keys, so\\\\\\\\nwhat Redis Cluster really does during *resharding* is to move keys from\\\\\\\\nan instance to another instance. Moving a hash slot means moving all the keys\\\\\\\\nthat happen to hash into this hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo understand how this works we need to show the [`CLUSTER`](/commands/cluster) subcommands\\\\\\\\nthat are used to manipulate the slots translation table in a Redis Cluster node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following subcommands are available (among others not useful in this case):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-delslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-addslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-delslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot NODE node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot MIGRATING node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot IMPORTING node\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first four commands, `ADDSLOTS`, `DELSLOTS`, `ADDSLOTSRANGE` and `DELSLOTSRANGE`, are simply used to assign\\\\\\\\n(or remove) slots to a Redis node. Assigning a slot means to tell a given\\\\\\\\nmaster node that it will be in charge of storing and serving content for\\\\\\\\nthe specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the hash slots are assigned they will propagate across the cluster\\\\\\\\nusing the gossip protocol, as specified later in the\\\\\\\\n*configuration propagation* section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `ADDSLOTS` and `ADDSLOTSRANGE` commands are usually used when a new cluster is created\\\\\\\\nfrom scratch to assign each master node a subset of all the 16384 hash\\\\\\\\nslots available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `DELSLOTS`  and `DELSLOTSRANGE` are mainly used for manual modification of a cluster configuration\\\\\\\\nor for debugging tasks: in practice it is rarely used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `SETSLOT` subcommand is used to assign a slot to a specific node ID if\\\\\\\\nthe `SETSLOT <slot> NODE` form is used. Otherwise the slot can be set in the\\\\\\\\ntwo special states `MIGRATING` and `IMPORTING`. Those two special states\\\\\\\\nare used in order to migrate a hash slot from one node to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as MIGRATING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the key in question\\\\\\\\nexists, otherwise the query is forwarded using a `-ASK` redirection to the\\\\\\\\nnode that is target of the migration.\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as IMPORTING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the request is\\\\\\\\npreceded by an [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command. If the [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command was not given\\\\\\\\nby the client, the query is redirected to the real hash slot owner via\\\\\\\\na `-MOVED` redirection error, as would happen normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s make this clearer with an example of hash slot migration.\\\\\\\\nAssume that we have two Redis master nodes, called A and B.\\\\\\\\nWe want to move hash slot 8 from A to B, so we issue commands like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We send B: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 IMPORTING A\\\\\\\\n* We send A: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 MIGRATING B\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll the other nodes will continue to point clients to node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" every time\\\\\\\\nthey are queried with a key that belongs to hash slot 8, so what happens\\\\\\\\nis that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* All queries about existing keys are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* All queries about non-existing keys in A are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\", because \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will redirect clients to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis way we no longer create new keys in \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\nIn the meantime, `redis-cli` used during reshardings\\\\\\\\nand Redis Cluster configuration will migrate existing keys in\\\\\\\\nhash slot 8 from A to B.\\\\\\\\nThis is performed using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT slot count\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will return `count` keys in the specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\nFor keys returned, `redis-cli` sends node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) command, that\\\\\\\\nwill migrate the specified keys from A to B in an atomic way (both instances\\\\\\\\nare locked for the time (usually very small time) needed to migrate keys so\\\\\\\\nthere are no race conditions). This is how [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    MIGRATE target_host target_port \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\" target_database id timeout KEYS key1 key2 ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) will connect to the target instance, send a serialized version of\\\\\\\\nthe key, and once an OK code is received, the old key from its own dataset\\\\\\\\nwill be deleted. From the point of view of an external client a key exists\\\\\\\\neither in A or B at any given time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis Cluster there is no need to specify a database other than 0, but\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is a general command that can be used for other tasks not\\\\\\\\ninvolving Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is optimized to be as fast as possible even when moving complex\\\\\\\\nkeys such as long lists, but in Redis Cluster reconfiguring the\\\\\\\\ncluster where big keys are present is not considered a wise procedure if\\\\\\\\nthere are latency constraints in the application using the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the migration process is finally finished, the `SETSLOT <slot> NODE <node-id>` command is sent to the two nodes involved in the migration in order to\\\\\\\\nset the slots to their normal state again. The same command is usually\\\\\\\\nsent to all other nodes to avoid waiting for the natural\\\\\\\\npropagation of the new configuration across the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8739,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-025\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration handling, propagation, and failovers > Hash slots configuration propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"An important part of Redis Cluster is the mechanism used to propagate the information about which cluster node is serving a given set of hash slots. This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.4964,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster 101 > Redis Cluster master-replica model\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster does not use consistent hashing, but a different form of sharding\\\\\\\\nwhere every key is conceptually part of what we call a **hash slot**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute the hash\\\\\\\\nslot for a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo\\\\\\\\n16384.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,\\\\\\\\nso, for example, you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.\\\\\\\\n* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.\\\\\\\\n* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes it easy to add and remove cluster nodes. For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.7624,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-010\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Reshard the cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Now we are ready to try a cluster resharding.

So it starts with questions. The first\\\\\\\\nis how much of a resharding do you want to do:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    How many slots do you want to move (from 1 to 16384)?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can try to reshard 1000 hash slots, that should already contain a non\\\\\\\\ntrivial amount of keys if the example is still running without the sleep\\\\\\\\ncall.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen redis-cli needs to know what is the target of the resharding, that is,\\\\\\\\nthe node that will receive the hash slots.\\\\\\\\nI\\'ll use the first master node, that is, 127.0.0.1:7000, but I need\\\\\\\\nto specify the Node ID of the instance. This was already printed in a\\\\\\\\nlist by redis-cli, but I can always find the ID of a node with the following\\\\\\\\ncommand if I need:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes | grep myself\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5460\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOk so my target node is 97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow you\\'ll get asked from what nodes you want to take those keys.\\\\\\\\nI\\'ll just type `all` in order to take a bit of hash slots from all the\\\\\\\\nother master nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the final confirmation you\\'ll see a message for every slot that\\\\\\\\nredis-cli is going to move from a node to another, and a dot will be printed\\\\\\\\nfor every actual key moved from one side to the other.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the resharding is in progress you should be able to see your\\\\\\\\nexample program running unaffected. You can stop and restart it multiple times\\\\\\\\nduring the resharding if you want.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the end of the resharding, you can test the health of the cluster with\\\\\\\\nthe following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --cluster check 127.0.0.1:7000\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll the slots will be covered as usual, but this time the master at\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:7000 will have more hash slots, something around 6461.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResharding can be performed automatically without the need to manually\\\\\\\\nenter the parameters in an interactive way.

Note that in the base case this just means that the old master will be a replica of the replica that replaced it after a failover.

Redis provides a range of persistence options. These include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RDB** (Redis Database): RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.\\\\\\\\n* **AOF** (Append Only File): AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server. These operations can then be replayed again at server startup, reconstructing the original dataset. Commands are logged using the same format as the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n* **No persistence**: You can disable persistence completely. This is sometimes used when caching.\\\\\\\\n* **RDB + AOF**: You can also combine both AOF and RDB in the same instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\'d rather not think about the tradeoffs between these different persistence strategies, you may want to consider [Redis Software\\'s persistence options](), which can be pre-configured using a UI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about how to evaluate your Redis persistence strategy, read on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is a very compact single-file point-in-time representation of your Redis data. RDB files are perfect for backups. For instance you may want to archive your RDB files every hour for the latest 24 hours, and to save an RDB snapshot every day for 30 days. This allows you to easily restore different versions of the data set in case of disasters.\\\\\\\\n* RDB is very good for disaster recovery, being a single compact file that can be transferred to far data centers, or onto Amazon S3 (possibly encrypted).\\\\\\\\n* RDB maximizes Redis performances since the only work the Redis parent process needs to do in order to persist is forking a child that will do all the rest. The parent process will never perform disk I/O or alike.\\\\\\\\n* RDB allows faster restarts with big datasets compared to AOF.\\\\\\\\n* On replicas, RDB supports [partial resynchronizations after restarts and failovers]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is NOT good if you need to minimize the chance of data loss in case Redis stops working (for example after a power outage). You can configure different *save points* where an RDB is produced (for instance after at least five minutes and 100 writes against the data set, you can have multiple save points). However you\\'ll usually create an RDB snapshot every five minutes or more, so in case of Redis stopping working without a correct shutdown for any reason you should be prepared to lose the latest minutes of data.\\\\\\\\n* RDB needs to fork() often in order to persist on disk using a child process. fork() can be time consuming if the dataset is big, and may result in Redis stopping serving clients for some milliseconds or even for one second if the dataset is very big and the CPU performance is not great. AOF also needs to fork() but less frequently and you can tune how often you want to rewrite your logs without any trade-off on durability.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.2302,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"AOF disadvantages\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Using AOF Redis is much more durable: you can have different fsync policies: no fsync at all, fsync every second, fsync at every query. With the default policy of fsync every second, write performance is still great. fsync is performed using a background thread and the main thread will try hard to perform writes when no fsync is in progress, so you can only lose one second worth of writes.\\\\\\\\n* The AOF log is an append-only log, so there are no seeks, nor corruption problems if there is a power outage. Even if the log ends with a half-written command for some reason (disk full or other reasons) the redis-check-aof tool is able to fix it easily.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is able to automatically rewrite the AOF in background when it gets too big. The rewrite is completely safe as while Redis continues appending to the old file, a completely new one is produced with the minimal set of operations needed to create the current data set, and once this second file is ready Redis switches the two and starts appending to the new one.\\\\\\\\n* AOF contains a log of all the operations one after the other in an easy to understand and parse format. You can even easily export an AOF file. For instance even if you\\'ve accidentally flushed everything using the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command, as long as no rewrite of the log was performed in the meantime, you can still save your data set just by stopping the server, removing the latest command, and restarting Redis again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF files are usually bigger than the equivalent RDB files for the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n* AOF can be slower than RDB depending on the exact fsync policy. In general with fsync set to *every second* performance is still very high, and with fsync disabled it should be exactly as fast as RDB even under high load. Still RDB is able to provide more guarantees about the maximum latency even in the case of a huge write load.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis < 7.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF can use a lot of memory if there are writes to the database during a rewrite (these are buffered in memory and written to the new AOF at the end).\\\\\\\\n* All write commands that arrive during rewrite are written to disk twice.\\\\\\\\n* Redis could freeze writing and fsyncing these write commands to the new AOF file at the end of the rewrite.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nOk, so what should I use?\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe general indication you should use both persistence methods is if\\\\\\\\nyou want a degree of data safety comparable to what PostgreSQL can provide you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you care a lot about your data, but still can live with a few minutes of\\\\\\\\ndata loss in case of disasters, you can simply use RDB alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are many users using AOF alone, but we discourage it since to have an\\\\\\\\nRDB snapshot from time to time is a great idea for doing database backups,\\\\\\\\nfor faster restarts, and in the event of bugs in the AOF engine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following sections will illustrate a few more details about the two persistence models.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8847,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Append-only file > How I can switch to AOF, if I\\'m currently using dump.rdb snapshots?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If you want to enable AOF in a server that is currently using RDB snapshots, you need to convert the data by enabling AOF via CONFIG command on the live server first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT:** not following this procedure (e.g. just changing the config and restarting the server) can result in data loss!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis >= 2.2**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreparations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Make a backup of your latest dump.rdb file.\\\\\\\\n* Transfer this backup to a safe place.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSwitch to AOF on live database:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Enable AOF: `redis-cli config set appendonly yes`\\\\\\\\n* Optionally disable RDB: `redis-cli config set save \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`\\\\\\\\n* Make sure writes are appended to the append only file correctly.\\\\\\\\n* **IMPORTANT:** Update your `redis.conf` (potentially through [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite)) and ensure that it matches the configuration above.\\\\\\\\n  If you forget this step, when you restart the server, the configuration changes will be lost and the server will start again with the old configuration, resulting in a loss of your data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext time you restart the server:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Before restarting the server, wait for AOF rewrite to finish persisting the data.\\\\\\\\n  You can do that by watching `INFO persistence`, waiting for `aof_rewrite_in_progress` and `aof_rewrite_scheduled` to be `0`, and validating that `aof_last_bgrewrite_status` is `ok`.\\\\\\\\n* After restarting the server, check that your database contains the same number of keys it contained previously.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis 2.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Make a backup of your latest dump.rdb file.\\\\\\\\n* Transfer this backup into a safe place.\\\\\\\\n* Stop all the writes against the database!\\\\\\\\n* Issue a `redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF`.

Redis data types are closely related to fundamental data structures and are exposed to the programmer as such, without additional abstraction layers.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can\\'t be larger than memory. Another advantage of\\\\\\\\nin-memory databases is that the memory representation of complex data structures\\\\\\\\nis much simpler to manipulate compared to the same data structures on disk, so\\\\\\\\nRedis can do a lot with little internal complexity. At the same time the\\\\\\\\ntwo on-disk storage formats (RDB and AOF) don\\'t need to be suitable for random\\\\\\\\naccess, so they are compact and always generated in an append-only fashion\\\\\\\\n(Even the AOF log rotation is an append-only operation, since the new version\\\\\\\\nis generated from the copy of data in memory). However this design also involves\\\\\\\\ndifferent challenges compared to traditional on-disk stores. Being the main data\\\\\\\\nrepresentation on memory, Redis operations must be carefully handled to make sure\\\\\\\\nthere is always an updated version of the data set on disk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An empty instance uses ~ 3MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 85MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 160 MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting your use case is trivial. Use the `redis-benchmark` utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the `INFO memory` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n64-bit systems will use considerably more memory than 32-bit systems to store the same keys, especially if the keys and values are small. This is because pointers take 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. But of course the advantage is that you can\\\\\\\\nhave a lot of memory in 64-bit systems, so in order to run large Redis servers a 64-bit system is more or less required. The alternative is sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past the Redis developers experimented with Virtual Memory and other systems in order to allow larger than RAM datasets, but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well: data served from memory, disk used for storage.

After connecting, clients must authenticate with a username and password, and the connection inherits the permissions of that user.\n\n## Configuration Methods\n\nYou can define ACL users in two ways (mutually exclusive):\n\n1. **Directly in `redis.conf`** - Good for simple use cases\n2. **External ACL file** - Recommended for complex environments with multiple users\n\n### Method 1: Configure in redis.conf\n\nAdd user definitions directly:\n\n```\nuser <username> ... acl rules ...\n```\n\nExample:\n```\nuser worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99\n```\n\n### Method 2: External ACL File\n\nSpecify the ACL file location in `redis.conf`:\n\n```\naclfile /etc/redis/users.acl\n```\n\nThen manage ACLs dynamically:\n- `ACL LOAD` - Reload ACL file after manual edits\n- `ACL SAVE` - Save current ACL configuration to file\n\n## ACL Rule Syntax\n\nRules are applied left-to-right. The default user configuration looks like:\n\n```\nuser default on nopass ~* &* +@all\n```\n\nKey components:\n- `on` - User is active\n- `nopass` - No password required (or use `>password` to set one)\n- `~*` - Access to all keys (or `~pattern` for specific keys)\n- `&*` - Access to all Pub/Sub channels\n- `+@all` - Can execute all commands\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n**1. Read-only user:**\n```\nACL SETUSER readonly on >password ~* +@read\n```\n\n**2. Worker with limited access:**\n```\nuser worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99\n```\nThis allows only list and connection commands on keys matching `jobs:*`.\n\n**3. Sentinel user (for high availability):**\n```\nACL SETUSER sentinel-user on >somepassword allchannels +multi +slaveof +ping +exec +subscribe +config|rewrite +role +publish +info +client|setname +client|kill +script|kill\n```\n\n**4. Replica user:**\n```\nACL setuser replica-user on >somepassword +psync +replconf +ping\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\nUse the extended AUTH command:\n```\nAUTH <username> <password>\n```\n\nOr the backward-compatible form (authenticates as \"default\" user):\n```\nAUTH <password>\n```\n\n## Managing ACLs\n\nView current ACLs:\n```\nACL LIST\n```\n\nThis shows all users and their rules in the same format used in configuration files.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md > Configure ACLs with the ACL command, ACL rules for Sentinel and Replicas]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "ACL", "user", "permission", "replica", "PSYNC", "MULTI", "EXEC", "script"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "5d3fcb0b-4d4a-474a-9055-688b3e71e7ef", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "0ee016b5-7bcf-4d5a-af63-fbace8e5eb5b", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis ACL configuration for fine-grained access control.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_EabkCBRby7U2mNJGFVCpE6', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis ACL fine-grained access control configuration', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_u2T77nNKVyoSuso6qlqH3t', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'ACL|access control list'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_EabkCBRby7U2mNJGFVCpE6', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.6987,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ACL\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"When ACLs are useful\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis ACL, short for Access Control List, is the feature that allows certain\\\\\\\\nconnections to be limited in terms of the commands that can be executed and the\\\\\\\\nkeys that can be accessed. The way it works is that, after connecting, a client\\\\\\\\nis required to provide a username and a valid password to authenticate. If authentication succeeded, the connection is associated with a given\\\\\\\\nuser and the limits the user has. Redis can be configured so that new\\\\\\\\nconnections are already authenticated with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\" user (this is the\\\\\\\\ndefault configuration). Configuring the default user has, as a side effect,\\\\\\\\nthe ability to provide only a specific subset of functionalities to connections\\\\\\\\nthat are not explicitly authenticated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the default configuration, Redis 6 (the first version to have ACLs) works\\\\\\\\nexactly like older versions of Redis. Every new connection is\\\\\\\\ncapable of calling every possible command and accessing every key, so the\\\\\\\\nACL feature is backward compatible with old clients and applications. Also\\\\\\\\nthe old way to configure a password, using the **requirepass** configuration\\\\\\\\ndirective, still works as expected. However, it now\\\\\\\\nsets a password for the default user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command was extended in Redis 6, so now it is possible to\\\\\\\\nuse it in the two-arguments form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <username> <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of the old form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat happens is that the username used to authenticate is \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so\\\\\\\\njust specifying the password implies that we want to authenticate against\\\\\\\\nthe default user. This provides backward compatibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore using ACLs, you may want to ask yourself what\\'s the goal you want to\\\\\\\\naccomplish by implementing this layer of protection. Normally there are\\\\\\\\ntwo main goals that are well served by ACLs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You want to improve security by restricting the access to commands and keys, so that untrusted clients have no access and trusted clients have just the minimum access level to the database in order to perform the work needed. For instance, certain clients may just be able to execute read only commands.\\\\\\\\n2. You want to improve operational safety, so that processes or humans accessing Redis are not allowed to damage the data or the configuration due to software errors or manual mistakes. For instance, there is no reason for a worker that fetches delayed jobs from Redis to be able to call the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother typical usage of ACLs is related to managed Redis instances. Redis is\\\\\\\\noften provided as a managed service both by internal company teams that handle\\\\\\\\nthe Redis infrastructure for the other internal customers they have, or is\\\\\\\\nprovided in a software-as-a-service setup by cloud providers. In both \\\\\\\\nsetups, we want to be sure that configuration commands are excluded for the\\\\\\\\ncustomers.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3094,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0-009\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ACL\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"ACL rules for Sentinel and Replicas\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"There are two ways to store users inside the Redis configuration:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Users can be specified directly inside the `redis.conf` file.\\\\\\\\n2. It is possible to specify an external ACL file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two methods are *mutually incompatible*, so Redis will ask you to use one\\\\\\\\nor the other. Specifying users inside `redis.conf` is\\\\\\\\ngood for simple use cases. When there are multiple users to define, in a\\\\\\\\ncomplex environment, we recommend you use the ACL file instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe format used inside `redis.conf` and in the external ACL file is exactly\\\\\\\\nthe same, so it is trivial to switch from one to the other, and is\\\\\\\\nthe following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    user <username> ... acl rules ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    user worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you want to use an external ACL file, you are required to specify\\\\\\\\nthe configuration directive called `aclfile`, like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    aclfile /etc/redis/users.acl\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are just specifying a few users directly inside the `redis.conf`\\\\\\\\nfile, you can use [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite) in order to store the new user configuration\\\\\\\\ninside the file by rewriting it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe external ACL file however is more powerful. You can do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Use [`ACL LOAD`](/commands/acl-load) if you modified the ACL file manually and you want Redis to reload the new configuration. Note that this command is able to load the file *only if all the users are correctly specified*. Otherwise, an error is reported to the user, and the old configuration will remain valid.\\\\\\\\n* Use [`ACL SAVE`](/commands/acl-save) to save the current ACL configuration to the ACL file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite) does not also trigger [`ACL SAVE`](/commands/acl-save). When you use\\\\\\\\nan ACL file, the configuration and the ACLs are handled separately.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn case you don\\'t want to provide Redis replicas and Redis Sentinel instances\\\\\\\\nfull access to your Redis instances, the following is the set of commands\\\\\\\\nthat must be allowed in order for everything to work correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinel, allow the user to access the following commands both in the master and replica instances:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AUTH, CLIENT, SUBSCRIBE, SCRIPT, PUBLISH, PING, INFO, MULTI, SLAVEOF, CONFIG, CLIENT, EXEC.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel does not need to access any key in the database but does use Pub/Sub, so the ACL rule would be the following (note: [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) is not needed since it is always allowed):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ACL SETUSER sentinel-user on >somepassword allchannels +multi +slaveof +ping +exec +subscribe +config|rewrite +role +publish +info +client|setname +client|kill +script|kill\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis replicas require the following commands to be allowed on the master instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PSYNC, REPLCONF, PING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNo keys need to be accessed, so this translates to the following rules:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ACL setuser replica-user on >somepassword +psync +replconf +ping\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that you don\\'t need to configure the replicas to allow the master to be able to execute any set of commands.

To do that, you\\'ll need to disable the default superuser (or at the very least set it up with a strong password) and create a new one and allow it access to Pub/Sub channels:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    127.0.0.1:5000> ACL SETUSER admin ON >admin-password allchannels +@all\\\\\\\\n    OK\\\\\\\\n    127.0.0.1:5000> ACL SETUSER default off\\\\\\\\n    OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe default user is used by Sentinel to connect to other instances. You can provide the credentials of another superuser with the following configuration directives:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel sentinel-user <username>\\\\\\\\n    sentinel sentinel-pass <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhere `<username>` and `<password>` are the Sentinel\\'s superuser and password, respectively (e.g. `admin` and `admin-password` in the example above).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, for authenticating incoming client connections, you can create a Sentinel restricted user profile such as the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    127.0.0.1:5000> ACL SETUSER sentinel-user ON >user-password -@all +auth +client|getname +client|id +client|setname +command +hello +ping +role +sentinel|get-master-addr-by-name +sentinel|master +sentinel|myid +sentinel|replicas +sentinel|sentinels +sentinel|masters\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRefer to the documentation of your Sentinel client of choice for further information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo use Sentinel with password-only authentication, add the `requirepass` configuration directive to **all** your Sentinel instances as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    requirepass \\\\\\\\\\\\\"your_password_here\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen configured this way, Sentinels will do two things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A password will be required from clients in order to send commands to Sentinels. This is obvious since this is how such configuration directive works in Redis in general.\\\\\\\\n2.

部分重同步\n当主从连接断开后重连，从节点会尝试 **部分重同步（partial resynchronization）**，只获取断线期间丢失的命令流部分。\n\n### 3. 完全重同步\n如果部分重同步不可行（backlog 不足或复制历史不匹配），从节点会请求 **完全重同步（full resynchronization）**：\n- 主节点启动后台进程生成 RDB 快照\n- 同时缓冲所有新写入命令\n- RDB 传输完成后，从节点保存到磁盘并加载到内存\n- 主节点再发送所有缓冲的命令\n\n---\n\n## PSYNC 工作原理\n\nPSYNC 是 Redis 用于智能同步的核心命令（替代旧的 SYNC 命令），支持增量同步。\n\n### 核心概念：Replication ID + Offset\n\n每个 Redis 主节点有两个关键标识：\n- **Replication ID**：伪随机字符串，标记数据集的历史版本\n- **Replication Offset**：递增偏移量，记录已发送的复制流字节数\n\n这两个值的组合 `(Replication ID, Offset)` 唯一标识主节点数据集的精确版本。\n\n### PSYNC 握手流程\n\n1. **从节点发起 PSYNC 请求**  \n   从节点连接主节点时，发送 `PSYNC` 命令，携带：\n   - 旧主节点的 Replication ID\n   - 已处理的 Offset\n\n2. **主节点判断同步方式**\n   - **增量同步**：如果主节点的 backlog 中有从节点缺失的命令，只发送增量部分\n   - **完全同步**：如果 backlog 不足或 Replication ID 不匹配（历史不一致），执行完全重同步\n\n### 双 Replication ID 机制\n\nRedis 实例维护两个 Replication ID（主 ID 和次 ID），用于故障转移场景：\n- 从节点提升为主节点后，将旧的主 ID 保存为次 ID\n- 其他从节点连接新主节点时，可以用旧主 ID 进行部分重同步\n- 避免故障转移后强制完全重同步\n\n---\n\n## 关键特性\n\n- **异步复制**：主节点不等待从节点确认，低延迟高性能\n- **非阻塞**：主节点在同步期间继续处理查询\n- **多从节点**：一个主节点可以有多个从节点，从节点也可以级联\n- **自动重连**：从节点断线后自动重连并尝试部分重同步\n\n---\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md > How Redis replication works]**", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md", "docs/progress-2025-02-13.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RDB", "replication", "replica", "PSYNC"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md", "docs/progress-2025-02-13.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "a9eb6683-a365-4a5c-aa6c-53d5e077a39c", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "d514a753-c11d-4fde-be13-aeb49c359ce0", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来检索 Redis 主从复制和 PSYNC 的相关信息。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_Rj20X4KCdLYftjqsEXfBO3', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis 主从复制 replication PSYNC 工作原理', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_MyH96B8ls8bdyuenPRKD9t', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'PSYNC|主从复制|replication'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_Rj20X4KCdLYftjqsEXfBO3', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.6812,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"How Redis replication works\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Every Redis master has a replication ID: it is a large pseudo random string\\\\\\\\nthat marks a given history of the dataset. Each master also takes an offset that\\\\\\\\nincrements for every byte of replication stream that it is produced to be\\\\\\\\nsent to replicas, to update the state of the replicas with the new changes\\\\\\\\nmodifying the dataset. The replication offset is incremented even if no replica\\\\\\\\nis actually connected, so basically every given pair of:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Replication ID, offset\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdentifies an exact version of the dataset of a master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen replicas connect to masters, they use the [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) command to send\\\\\\\\ntheir old master replication ID and the offsets they processed so far. This way\\\\\\\\nthe master can send just the incremental part needed. However if there is not\\\\\\\\nenough *backlog* in the master buffers, or if the replica is referring to an\\\\\\\\nhistory (replication ID) which is no longer known, then a full resynchronization\\\\\\\\nhappens: in this case the replica will get a full copy of the dataset, from scratch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how a full synchronization works in more details:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe master starts a background saving process to produce an RDB file. At the same time it starts to buffer all new write commands received from the clients. When the background saving is complete, the master transfers the database file to the replica, which saves it on disk, and then loads it into memory. The master will then send all buffered commands to the replica. This is done as a stream of commands and is in the same format of the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can try it yourself via telnet. Connect to the Redis port while the\\\\\\\\nserver is doing some work and issue the [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) command. You\\'ll see a bulk\\\\\\\\ntransfer and then every command received by the master will be re-issued\\\\\\\\nin the telnet session. Actually [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) is an old protocol no longer used by\\\\\\\\nnewer Redis instances, but is still there for backward compatibility: it does\\\\\\\\nnot allow partial resynchronizations, so now [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) is used instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs already said, replicas are able to automatically reconnect when the master-replica link goes down for some reason. If the master receives multiple concurrent replica synchronization requests, it performs a single background save in to serve all of them.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.6188,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"At the base of Redis replication (excluding the high availability features provided as an additional layer by Redis Cluster or Redis Sentinel) there is a *leader follower* (master-replica) replication that is simple to use and configure. It allows replica Redis instances to be exact copies of master instances. The replica will automatically reconnect to the master every time the link breaks, and will attempt to be an exact copy of it *regardless* of what happens to the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis system works using three main mechanisms:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. When a master and a replica instance are well-connected, the master keeps the replica updated by sending a stream of commands to the replica to replicate the effects on the dataset happening on the master side due to: client writes, keys expired or evicted, any other action changing the master dataset.\\\\\\\\n2. When the link between the master and the replica breaks, for network issues or because a timeout is sensed in the master or the replica, the replica reconnects and attempts to proceed with a partial resynchronization: it means that it will try to just obtain the part of the stream of commands it missed during the disconnection.\\\\\\\\n3. When a partial resynchronization is not possible, the replica will ask for a full resynchronization. This will involve a more complex process in which the master needs to create a snapshot of all its data, send it to the replica, and then continue sending the stream of commands as the dataset changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses by default asynchronous replication, which being low latency and\\\\\\\\nhigh performance, is the natural replication mode for the vast majority of Redis\\\\\\\\nuse cases. However, Redis replicas asynchronously acknowledge the amount of data\\\\\\\\nthey receive periodically with the master. So the master does not wait every time\\\\\\\\nfor a command to be processed by the replicas, however it knows, if needed, what\\\\\\\\nreplica already processed what command. This allows having optional synchronous replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSynchronous replication of certain data can be requested by the clients using\\\\\\\\nthe [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) command. However [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) is only able to ensure there are the\\\\\\\\nspecified number of acknowledged copies in the other Redis instances, it does not\\\\\\\\nturn a set of Redis instances into a CP system with strong consistency: acknowledged\\\\\\\\nwrites can still be lost during a failover, depending on the exact configuration\\\\\\\\nof the Redis persistence. However, [WAIT]() dramatically reduces the probability of losing a write after a failure event to specific hard-to-trigger failure modes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can check the Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster documentation for more information\\\\\\\\nabout high availability and failover.

Aside from connecting a number of replicas to the same master, replicas can also be connected to other replicas in a cascading-like structure. Since Redis 4.0, all the sub-replicas will receive exactly the same replication stream from the master.\\\\\\\\n* Redis replication is non-blocking on the master side. This means that the master will continue to handle queries when one or more replicas perform the initial synchronization or a partial resynchronization.\\\\\\\\n* Replication is also largely non-blocking on the replica side. While the replica is performing the initial synchronization, it can handle queries using the old version of the dataset, assuming you configured Redis to do so in redis.conf.  Otherwise, you can configure Redis replicas to return an error to clients if the replication stream is down. However, after the initial sync, the old dataset must be deleted and the new one must be loaded. The replica will block incoming connections during this brief window (that can be as long as many seconds for very large datasets). Since Redis 4.0 you can configure Redis so that the deletion of the old data set happens in a different thread, however loading the new initial dataset will still happen in the main thread and block the replica.\\\\\\\\n* Replication can be used both for scalability, to have multiple replicas for read-only queries (for example, slow O(N) operations can be offloaded to replicas), or simply for improving data safety and high availability.\\\\\\\\n* You can use replication to avoid the cost of having the master writing the full dataset to disk: a typical technique involves configuring your master `redis.conf` to avoid persisting to disk at all, then connect a replica configured to save from time to time, or with AOF enabled. However, this setup must be handled with care, since a restarting master will start with an empty dataset: if the replica tries to sync with it, the replica will be emptied as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2414,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Allow writes only with N attached replicas\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If your master has a password via `requirepass`, it\\'s trivial to configure the\\\\\\\\nreplica to use that password in all sync operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo do it on a running instance, use `redis-cli` and type:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    config set masterauth <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo set it permanently, add this to your config file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    masterauth <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStarting with Redis 2.8, you can configure a Redis master to\\\\\\\\naccept write queries only if at least N replicas are currently connected to the\\\\\\\\nmaster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, because Redis uses asynchronous replication it is not possible to ensure\\\\\\\\nthe replica actually received a given write, so there is always a window for data\\\\\\\\nloss.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how the feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis replicas ping the master every second, acknowledging the amount of replication stream processed.\\\\\\\\n* Redis masters will remember the last time it received a ping from every replica.\\\\\\\\n* The user can configure a minimum number of replicas that have a lag not greater than a maximum number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf there are at least N replicas, with a lag less than M seconds, then the write will be accepted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may think of it as a best effort data safety mechanism, where consistency is not ensured for a given write, but at least the time window for data loss is restricted to a given number of seconds.

Replicas don\\'t expire keys, instead they wait for masters to expire the keys. When a master expires a key (or evict it because of LRU), it synthesizes a [`DEL`](/commands/del) command which is transmitted to all the replicas.\\\\\\\\n2. However because of master-driven expire, sometimes replicas may still have in memory keys that are already logically expired, since the master was not able to provide the [`DEL`](/commands/del) command in time. To deal with that the replica uses its logical clock to report that a key does not exist **only for read operations** that don\\'t violate the consistency of the data set (as new commands from the master will arrive). In this way replicas avoid reporting logically expired keys that are still existing. In practical terms, an HTML fragments cache that uses replicas to scale will avoid returning items that are already older than the desired time to live.\\\\\\\\n3. During Lua scripts executions no key expiries are performed. As a Lua script runs, conceptually the time in the master is frozen, so that a given key will either exist or not for all the time the script runs. This prevents keys expiring in the middle of a script, and is needed to send the same script to the replica in a way that is guaranteed to have the same effects in the data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce a replica is promoted to a master it will start to expire keys independently, and will not require any help from its old master.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3938,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Diskless replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In the previous section we said that if two instances have the same replication\\\\\\\\nID and replication offset, they have exactly the same data.

It is the offset that works as a logical time\\\\\\\\nto understand, for a given history (replication ID), who holds the most updated\\\\\\\\ndata set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, if two instances A and B have the same replication ID, but one\\\\\\\\nwith offset 1000 and one with offset 1023, it means that the first lacks certain\\\\\\\\ncommands applied to the data set. It also means that A, by applying just a few\\\\\\\\ncommands, may reach exactly the same state of B.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why Redis instances have two replication IDs is because of replicas\\\\\\\\nthat are promoted to masters. After a failover, the promoted replica requires\\\\\\\\nto still remember what was its past replication ID, because such replication ID\\\\\\\\nwas the one of the former master. In this way, when other replicas will sync\\\\\\\\nwith the new master, they will try to perform a partial resynchronization using the\\\\\\\\nold master replication ID. This will work as expected, because when the replica\\\\\\\\nis promoted to master it sets its secondary ID to its main ID, remembering what\\\\\\\\nwas the offset when this ID switch happened. Later it will select a new random\\\\\\\\nreplication ID, because a new history begins. When handling the new replicas\\\\\\\\nconnecting, the master will match their IDs and offsets both with the current\\\\\\\\nID and the secondary ID (up to a given offset, for safety). In short this means\\\\\\\\nthat after a failover, replicas connecting to the newly promoted master don\\'t have\\\\\\\\nto perform a full sync.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn case you wonder why a replica promoted to master needs to change its\\\\\\\\nreplication ID after a failover: it is possible that the old master is still\\\\\\\\nworking as a master because of some network partition: retaining the same\\\\\\\\nreplication ID would violate the fact that the same ID and same offset of any\\\\\\\\ntwo random instances mean they have the same data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally a full resynchronization requires creating an RDB file on disk,\\\\\\\\nthen reloading the same RDB from disk to feed the replicas with the data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith slow disks this can be a very stressing operation for the master.\\\\\\\\nRedis version 2.8.18 is the first version to have support for diskless\\\\\\\\nreplication. In this setup the child process directly sends the\\\\\\\\nRDB over the wire to replicas, without using the disk as intermediate storage.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.9901,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-005\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To configure basic Redis replication is trivial: just add the following line to the replica configuration file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    replicaof 192.168.1.1 6379\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOf course you need to replace 192.168.1.1 6379 with your master IP address (or\\\\\\\\nhostname) and port.

This does not mean that the feature is intended to expose a replica instance to the internet or more generally to a network where untrusted clients exist, because administrative commands like [`DEBUG`](/commands/debug) or [`CONFIG`](/commands/config) are still enabled. The [Security]() page describes how to secure a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may wonder why it is possible to revert the read-only setting\\\\\\\\nand have replica instances that can be targeted by write operations.\\\\\\\\nThe answer is that writable replicas exist only for historical reasons.\\\\\\\\nUsing writable replicas can result in inconsistency between the master and the replica, so it is not recommended to use writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nTo understand in which situations this can be a problem, we need to understand how replication works.\\\\\\\\nChanges on the master is replicated by propagating regular Redis commands to the replica.\\\\\\\\nWhen a key expires on the master, this is propagated as a DEL command.\\\\\\\\nIf a key which exists on the master but is deleted, expired or has a different type on the replica compared to the master will react differently to commands like DEL, INCR or RPOP propagated from the master than intended.\\\\\\\\nThe propagated command may fail on the replica or result in a different outcome.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risks (if you insist on using writable replicas) we suggest you follow these recommendations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t write to keys in a writable replica that are also used on the master.\\\\\\\\n  (This can be hard to guarantee if you don\\'t have control over all the clients that write to the master.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica as an intermediary step when upgrading a set of instances in a running system.\\\\\\\\n  In general, don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica if it can ever be promoted to a master if you want to guarantee data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHistorically, there were some use cases that were considered legitimate for writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, these use cases are now all obsolete and the same can be achieved by other means.\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Computing slow Set or Sorted set operations and storing the result in temporary local keys using commands like [`SUNIONSTORE`](/commands/sunionstore) and [`ZINTERSTORE`](/commands/zinterstore).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use commands that return the result without storing it, such as [`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and [`ZINTER`](/commands/zinter).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using the [`SORT`](/commands/sort) command (which is not considered a read-only command because of the optional STORE option and therefore cannot be used on a read-only replica).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`SORT_RO`](/commands/sort_ro), which is a read-only command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using [`EVAL`](/commands/eval) and [`EVALSHA`](/commands/evalsha) are also not considered read-only commands, because the Lua script may call write commands.\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`EVAL_RO`](/commands/eval_ro) and [`EVALSHA_RO`](/commands/evalsha_ro) where the Lua script can only call read-only commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile writes to a replica will be discarded if the replica and the master resync or if the replica is restarted, there is no guarantee that they will sync automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore version 4.0, writable replicas were incapable of expiring keys with a time to live set.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if you use [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) or other commands that set a maximum TTL for a key, the key will leak, and while you may no longer see it while accessing it with read commands, you will see it in the count of keys and it will still use memory.\\\\\\\\nRedis 4.0 RC3 and greater versions are able to evict keys with TTL as masters do, with the exceptions of keys written in DB numbers greater than 63 (but by default Redis instances only have 16 databases).\\\\\\\\nNote though that even in versions greater than 4.0, using [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) on a key that could ever exists on the master can cause inconsistency between the replica and the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that since Redis 4.0 replica writes are only local, and are not propagated to sub-replicas attached to the instance. Sub-replicas instead will always receive the replication stream identical to the one sent by the top-level master to the intermediate replicas. So for example in the following setup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    A ---> B ---> C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if `B` is writable, C will not see `B` writes and will instead have identical dataset as the master instance `A`.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6004,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-027\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration handling, propagation, and failovers > Replica migration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster implements a concept called *replica migration* in order to\\\\\\\\nimprove the availability of the system. The idea is that in a cluster with\\\\\\\\na master-replica setup, if the map between replicas and masters is fixed\\\\\\\\navailability is limited over time if multiple independent failures of single\\\\\\\\nnodes happen.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example in a cluster where every master has a single replica, the cluster\\\\\\\\ncan continue operations as long as either the master or the replica fail, but not\\\\\\\\nif both fail the same time. However there is a class of failures that are\\\\\\\\nthe independent failures of single nodes caused by hardware or software issues\\\\\\\\nthat can accumulate over time. For example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A has a single replica A1.\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted as new master.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails in an independent manner (unrelated to the failure of A). No other replica is available for promotion since node A is still down. The cluster cannot continue normal operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the map between masters and replicas is fixed, the only way to make the cluster\\\\\\\\nmore resistant to the above scenario is to add replicas to every master, however\\\\\\\\nthis is costly as it requires more instances of Redis to be executed, more\\\\\\\\nmemory, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn alternative is to create an asymmetry in the cluster, and let the cluster\\\\\\\\nlayout automatically change over time. For example the cluster may have three\\\\\\\\nmasters A, B, C. A and B have a single replica each, A1 and B1. However the master\\\\\\\\nC is different and has two replicas: C1 and C2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReplica migration is the process of automatic reconfiguration of a replica\\\\\\\\nin order to *migrate* to a master that has no longer coverage (no working\\\\\\\\nreplicas). With replica migration the scenario mentioned above turns into the\\\\\\\\nfollowing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted.\\\\\\\\n* C2 migrates as replica of A1, that is otherwise not backed by any replica.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails as well.\\\\\\\\n* C2 is promoted as new master to replace A1.\\\\\\\\n* The cluster can continue the operations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4997,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Safety of replication when master has persistence turned off\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In setups where Redis replication is used, it is strongly advised to have\\\\\\\\npersistence turned on in the master and in the replicas.

We have a setup with node A acting as master, with persistence turned down, and nodes B and C replicating from node A.\\\\\\\\n2.

Enable Latency Monitoring**\n```bash\nCONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\n```\nSet the threshold (in milliseconds) based on your requirements. This logs events that exceed the threshold.\n\n**2. Check Latency Reports**\n```bash\nLATENCY LATEST      # View latest latency samples\nLATENCY HISTORY     # View time series for specific events\nLATENCY DOCTOR      # Get human-readable analysis and recommendations\nLATENCY GRAPH       # ASCII visualization of latency spikes\n```\n\n**3. Measure Baseline Latency**\n```bash\nredis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\n```\nRun this on the Redis server (not client) to measure OS/hypervisor baseline latency.\n\n**4. Check for Slow Commands**\n```bash\nSLOWLOG GET 10\n```\n\n## Common Causes & Fixes\n\n**Slow Commands (O(N) operations)**\n- Avoid `KEYS` in production - use `SCAN` instead\n- Watch for `SORT`, `LREM`, `SUNION` on large datasets\n- Use `SLOWLOG` to identify problematic commands\n\n**Fork Operations (BGSAVE/AOF rewrite)**\n- Use HVM-based EC2 instances (not Xen)\n- Disable transparent huge pages:\n  ```bash\n  echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\n  ```\n\n**Swapping**\n- Check if Redis memory is swapped:\n  ```bash\n  cat /proc/$(pidof redis-server)/smaps | grep 'Swap:'\n  ```\n- Monitor with `vmstat 1` (watch `si`/`so` columns)\n- Fix: Add more RAM or reduce memory pressure\n\n**AOF Disk I/O**\n- Use `appendfsync everysec` (good compromise)\n- Enable `no-appendfsync-on-rewrite yes` to avoid fsync during rewrites\n- Use SSD or ensure no other processes compete for disk I/O\n\n**Mass Key Expiration**\n- Avoid setting many keys to expire at the same second\n- Redis blocks if >25% of sampled keys are expired simultaneously\n\n**Network Latency**\n- Use pipelining for multiple commands\n- Use Unix domain sockets if client is on same host\n- Use aggregated commands (`MSET`/`MGET`)\n\n## Quick Checklist\n\n1. Check slow commands: `SLOWLOG GET`\n2. Disable transparent huge pages\n3. Verify no swapping is occurring\n4. Use `redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100` to check baseline\n5. Enable latency monitoring and use `LATENCY DOCTOR`\n6. Choose appropriate AOF fsync policy (recommend `everysec`)\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency.md]\n[来源:

worst-case latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile Redis is an in-memory system, it deals with the operating system in\\\\\\\\ndifferent ways, for example, in the context of persisting to disk.\\\\\\\\nMoreover Redis implements a rich set of commands. Certain commands\\\\\\\\nare fast and run in constant or logarithmic time.

However, it poses\\\\\\\\na challenge for latency, since the single\\\\\\\\nthread must be able to perform certain tasks incrementally, for\\\\\\\\nexample key expiration, in a way that does not impact the other clients\\\\\\\\nthat are served.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor all these reasons, Redis 2.8.13 introduced a new feature called\\\\\\\\n**Latency Monitoring**, that helps the user to check and troubleshoot possible\\\\\\\\nlatency problems. Latency monitoring is composed of the following conceptual\\\\\\\\nparts:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Latency hooks that sample different latency-sensitive code paths.\\\\\\\\n* Time series recording of latency spikes, split by different events.\\\\\\\\n* Reporting engine to fetch raw data from the time series.\\\\\\\\n* Analysis engine to provide human-readable reports and hints according to the measurements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe rest of this document covers the latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\ndetails.

Other events are less generic and monitor\\\\\\\\nspecific operations performed by Redis. For example, the `fork` event\\\\\\\\nonly monitors the time taken by Redis to execute the `fork(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA latency spike is an event that takes more time to run than the configured latency\\\\\\\\nthreshold.

Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server.

Some applications may require that all queries be served in less than 1 millisecond.

Only events that take longer than the specified threshold will be logged as latency spikes. The user should set the threshold according to their needs. For example, if the application requires a maximum acceptable latency of 100 milliseconds, the threshold should be set to log all the events blocking the server for a time equal or greater to 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEnable the latency monitor at runtime in a production server\\\\\\\\nwith the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMonitoring is turned off by default (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero.

Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting.

See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.6113,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search/query-performance-factor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Query Performance Factor\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Monitoring Redis Query Engine\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To monitor a database with a query performance factor configured:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.6765,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b1c1a56c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b1c1a56c-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisearch/redisearch-1.6-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisearch 1.6 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.6 GA (January 2020)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This is the General Availability Release of RediSearch 1.6 (v1.6.7).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHeadlines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Several performance improvements increasing full-text search queries up to 60% and aggregation queries up to 73%.\\\\\\\\n- Support for aliasing of indices.\\\\\\\\n- Low-level API in C (and [Rust bindings](https://github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-api-rs)) to make RediSearch embeddable in other Redis modules.

Configure Memory Limits\n\n- **Set `maxmemory`**: Always configure an explicit memory limit to prevent Redis from consuming all system memory. Calculate overhead for Redis operations and fragmentation - if you have 10GB free, set it to 8-9GB.\n- **Set eviction policy**: Configure `maxmemory-policy` (consider `noeviction` to return errors instead of silently evicting data)\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Memory allocation]\n\n## 2. Use Special Encoding for Small Data Types\n\nRedis automatically optimizes small aggregate data types, using **up to 10x less memory** (5x average):\n\n- **Hashes, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets**: When smaller than configured thresholds, Redis uses memory-efficient encoding\n- Configure thresholds in redis.conf:\n  - `hash-max-zipmap-entries 256`\n  - `hash-max-zipmap-value 1024`\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Special encoding]\n\n## 3. Use Hashes for Key-Value Storage\n\nInstead of many individual keys, use hashes with multiple fields:\n\n- **Memory savings**: Storing 100,000 objects as hash fields uses ~1.7MB vs 11MB as individual keys (6x reduction)\n- **Technique**: Split keys like `object:1234` into hash key `object:12` with field `34`\n- Each hash should contain ~100 fields for optimal CPU/memory tradeoff\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Using hashes]\n\n## 4. Use Bit/Byte Operations for Compact Storage\n\n- **Bitmaps**: Store boolean flags using `GETBIT`/`SETBIT` - 100 million users = only 12MB\n- **Byte arrays**: Use `GETRANGE`/`SETRANGE` for compact data representation\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Use hashes when possible]\n\n## 5.

This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory error for write commands if and when it reaches the \\\\\\\\nlimit - which in turn may result in errors in the application but will not render the \\\\\\\\nwhole machine dead because of memory starvation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.0146,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Special encoding of small aggregate data types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Since Redis 2.2 many data types are optimized to use less space up to a certain size.\\\\\\\\nHashes, Lists, Sets composed of just integers, and Sorted Sets, when smaller than a given number of elements, and up to a maximum element size, are encoded in a very memory-efficient way that uses *up to 10 times less memory* (with 5 times less memory used being the average saving).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is completely transparent from the point of view of the user and API.\\\\\\\\nSince this is a CPU / memory tradeoff it is possible to tune the maximum \\\\\\\\nnumber of elements and maximum element size for special encoded types \\\\\\\\nusing the following redis.conf directives (defaults are shown):\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.9398,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Using hashes to abstract a very memory-efficient plain key-value store on top of Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"I understand the title of this section is a bit scary, but I\\'m going to explain in detail what this is about.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically it is possible to model a plain key-value store using Redis\\\\\\\\nwhere values can just be just strings, which is not just more memory efficient\\\\\\\\nthan Redis plain keys but also much more memory efficient than memcached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with some facts: a few keys use a lot more memory than a single key\\\\\\\\ncontaining a hash with a few fields. How is this possible? We use a trick.\\\\\\\\nIn theory to guarantee that we perform lookups in constant time\\\\\\\\n(also known as O(1) in big O notation) there is the need to use a data structure\\\\\\\\nwith a constant time complexity in the average case, like a hash table.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut many times hashes contain just a few fields. When hashes are small we can\\\\\\\\ninstead just encode them in an O(N) data structure, like a linear\\\\\\\\narray with length-prefixed key-value pairs. Since we do this only when N\\\\\\\\nis small, the amortized time for [`HGET`](/commands/hget) and [`HSET`](/commands/hset) commands is still O(1): the\\\\\\\\nhash will be converted into a real hash table as soon as the number of elements\\\\\\\\nit contains grows too large (you can configure the limit in redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis does not only work well from the point of view of time complexity, but\\\\\\\\nalso from the point of view of constant times since a linear array of key-value pairs happens to play very well with the CPU cache (it has a better\\\\\\\\ncache locality than a hash table).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since hash fields and values are not (always) represented as full-featured Redis objects, hash fields can\\'t have an associated time to live\\\\\\\\n(expire) like a real key, and can only contain a string. But we are okay with\\\\\\\\nthis, this was the intention anyway when the hash data type API was\\\\\\\\ndesigned (we trust simplicity more than features, so nested data structures\\\\\\\\nare not allowed, as expires of single fields are not allowed).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo hashes are memory efficient. This is useful when using hashes\\\\\\\\nto represent objects or to model other problems when there are group of\\\\\\\\nrelated fields. But what about if we have a plain key value business?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImagine we want to use Redis as a cache for many small objects, which can be JSON encoded objects, small HTML fragments, simple key -> boolean values\\\\\\\\nand so forth. Basically, anything is a string -> string map with small keys\\\\\\\\nand values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow let\\'s assume the objects we want to cache are numbered, like:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * object:102393\\\\\\\\n * object:1234\\\\\\\\n * object:5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what we can do. Every time we perform a\\\\\\\\nSET operation to set a new value, we actually split the key into two parts,\\\\\\\\none part used as a key, and the other part used as the field name for the hash. For instance, the\\\\\\\\nobject named \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:1234\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is actually split into:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* a Key named object:12\\\\\\\\n* a Field named 34\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo we use all the characters but the last two for the key, and the final\\\\\\\\ntwo characters for the hash field name. To set our key we use the following\\\\\\\\ncommand:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nHSET object:12 34 somevalue\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see every hash will end up containing 100 fields, which is an optimal compromise between CPU and memory saved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is another important thing to note, with this schema\\\\\\\\nevery hash will have more or\\\\\\\\nless 100 fields regardless of the number of objects we cached. This is because our objects will always end with a number and not a random string. In some way, the final number can be considered as a form of implicit pre-sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat about small numbers? Like object:2? We handle this case using just\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as a key name, and the whole number as the hash field name.\\\\\\\\nSo object:2 and object:10 will both end inside the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but one\\\\\\\\nas field name \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and one as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow much memory do we save this way?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI used the following Ruby program to test how this works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```ruby\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'rubygems\\'\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'redis\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUSE_OPTIMIZATION = true\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef hash_get_key_field(key)\\\\\\\\n  s = key.split(\\':\\')\\\\\\\\n  if s[1].length > 2\\\\\\\\n    { key: s[0] + \\':\\' + s[1][0..-3], field: s[1][-2..-1] }\\\\\\\\n  else\\\\\\\\n    { key: s[0] + \\':\\', field: s[1] }\\\\\\\\n  end\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef hash_set(r, key, value)\\\\\\\\n  kf = hash_get_key_field(key)\\\\\\\\n  r.hset(kf[:key], kf[:field], value)\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef hash_get(r, key, value)\\\\\\\\n  kf = hash_get_key_field(key)\\\\\\\\n  r.hget(kf[:key], kf[:field], value)\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nr = Redis.new\\\\\\\\n(0..100_000).each do |id|\\\\\\\\n  key = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:#{id}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n  if USE_OPTIMIZATION\\\\\\\\n    hash_set(r, key, \\'val\\')\\\\\\\\n  else\\\\\\\\n    r.set(key, \\'val\\')\\\\\\\\n  end\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the result against a 64 bit instance of Redis 2.2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * USE_OPTIMIZATION set to true: 1.7 MB of used memory\\\\\\\\n * USE_OPTIMIZATION set to false; 11 MB of used memory\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an order of magnitude, I think this makes Redis more or less the most\\\\\\\\nmemory efficient plain key value store out there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*WARNING*: for this to work, make sure that in your redis.conf you have\\\\\\\\nsomething like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nhash-max-zipmap-entries 256\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso remember to set the following field accordingly to the maximum size\\\\\\\\nof your keys and values:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nhash-max-zipmap-value 1024\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery time a hash exceeds the number of elements or element size specified\\\\\\\\nit will be converted into a real hash table, and the memory saving will be lost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may ask, why don\\'t you do this implicitly in the normal key space so that\\\\\\\\nI don\\'t have to care? There are two reasons: one is that we tend to make\\\\\\\\ntradeoffs explicit, and this is a clear tradeoff between many things: CPU,\\\\\\\\nmemory, and max element size. The second is that the top-level key space must\\\\\\\\nsupport a lot of interesting things like expires, LRU data, and so\\\\\\\\nforth so it is not practical to do this in a general way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut the Redis Way is that the user must understand how things work so that he can pick the best compromise and to understand how the system will\\\\\\\\nbehave exactly.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6567,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis FAQ\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Are Redis on-disk snapshots atomic?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Yes, a common design pattern involves taking very write-heavy small data\\\\\\\\nin Redis (and data you need the Redis data structures to model your problem\\\\\\\\nin an efficient way), and big *blobs* of data into an SQL or eventually\\\\\\\\nconsistent on-disk database. Similarly sometimes Redis is used in order to\\\\\\\\ntake in memory another copy of a subset of the same data stored in the on-disk\\\\\\\\ndatabase. This may look similar to caching, but actually is a more advanced model\\\\\\\\nsince normally the Redis dataset is updated together with the on-disk DB dataset,\\\\\\\\nand not refreshed on cache misses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA good practice is to consider memory consumption when mapping your logical data model to the physical data model within Redis. These considerations include using specific data types, key patterns, and normalization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeyond data modeling, there is more info in the [Memory Optimization page]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has built-in protections allowing the users to set a max limit on memory\\\\\\\\nusage, using the `maxmemory` option in the configuration file to put a limit\\\\\\\\nto the memory Redis can use. If this limit is reached, Redis will start to reply\\\\\\\\nwith an error to write commands (but will continue to accept read-only\\\\\\\\ncommands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also configure Redis to evict keys when the max memory limit\\\\\\\\nis reached. See the [eviction policy docs]() for more information on this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShort answer: `echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` :)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now the long one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis background saving schema relies on the copy-on-write semantic of the `fork` system call in\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems: Redis forks (creates a child process) that is an\\\\\\\\nexact copy of the parent. The child process dumps the DB on disk and finally\\\\\\\\nexits. In theory the child should use as much memory as the parent being a\\\\\\\\ncopy, but actually thanks to the copy-on-write semantic implemented by most\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems the parent and child process will _share_ the common\\\\\\\\nmemory pages. A page will be duplicated only when it changes in the child or in\\\\\\\\nthe parent. Since in theory all the pages may change while the child process is\\\\\\\\nsaving, Linux can\\'t tell in advance how much memory the child will take, so if\\\\\\\\nthe `overcommit_memory` setting is set to zero the fork will fail unless there is\\\\\\\\nas much free RAM as required to really duplicate all the parent memory pages.\\\\\\\\nIf you have a Redis dataset of 3 GB and just 2 GB of free\\\\\\\\nmemory it will fail.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSetting `overcommit_memory` to 1 tells Linux to relax and perform the fork in a\\\\\\\\nmore optimistic allocation fashion, and this is indeed what you want for Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can refer to the [proc(5)][proc5] man page for explanations of the\\\\\\\\navailable values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[proc5]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, the Redis background saving process is always forked when the server is\\\\\\\\noutside of the execution of a command, so every command reported to be atomic\\\\\\\\nin RAM is also atomic from the point of view of the disk snapshot.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6135,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process. These functions can be executed on-demand, by an event-driven trigger, or by a stream processing trigger. Triggers and functions empowers developers to build and maintain real-time applications by moving logic closer to the data, ensuring a lower latency whilst delivering the best developer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry it out with the [triggers and functions quick start](https://redis.io/docs/interact/programmability/triggers-and-functions/quick_start/).\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.9381,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/admin.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis administration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis setup tips > Replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Deploy Redis using the Linux operating system. Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4785,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"String objects APIs > `RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation`\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"void RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation(RedisModuleString *str);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 7.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTrim possible excess memory allocated for a `RedisModuleString`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes a `RedisModuleString` may have more memory allocated for\\\\\\\\nit than required, typically for argv arguments that were constructed\\\\\\\\nfrom network buffers.

You need to compile Redis with TLS enabled:\n\n```bash\nmake BUILD_TLS=yes\n```\n\n**Prerequisites:** Install OpenSSL development libraries (e.g., `libssl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)\n\n## Configuration\n\nConfigure Redis with the required certificates and keys in `redis.conf`:\n\n```\ntls-cert-file /path/to/redis.crt\ntls-key-file /path/to/redis.key\ntls-ca-cert-file /path/to/ca.crt\ntls-dh-params-file /path/to/redis.dh\n```\n\n## Enabling TLS Port\n\nEnable TLS on a specific port (in addition to regular TCP):\n\n```\ntls-port 6379\n```\n\nTo use **only TLS** and disable non-encrypted connections:\n\n```\nport 0\ntls-port 6379\n```\n\n## Starting Redis Server with TLS\n\n```bash\n./src/redis-server --tls-port 6379 --port 0 \\\n    --tls-cert-file ./tests/tls/redis.crt \\\n    --tls-key-file ./tests/tls/redis.key \\\n    --tls-ca-cert-file ./tests/tls/ca.crt\n```\n\n## Connecting with redis-cli\n\n```bash\n./src/redis-cli --tls \\\n    --cert ./tests/tls/redis.crt \\\n    --key ./tests/tls/redis.key \\\n    --cacert ./tests/tls/ca.crt\n```\n\n## Additional Configurations\n\n- **Client Authentication:** By default, Redis uses mutual TLS. To disable client certificate authentication: `tls-auth-clients no`\n- **Replication:** For replica servers to use TLS: `tls-replication yes`\n- **Cluster:** For Redis Cluster: `tls-cluster yes`\n- **Sentinel:** Inherits TLS settings; uses `tls-replication` directive\n\n## Performance Note\n\nTLS adds overhead for encryption/decryption and integrity checks, which decreases throughput. Redis 8.0+ supports I/O threading with TLS to improve performance.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md > TLS]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/build-stack/almalinux-rocky-8.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/install-redis-from-source.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "cluster", "replication", "replica", "TLS", "SSL", "encrypt"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/build-stack/almalinux-rocky-8.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/install-redis-from-source.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "6434c0b9-bf8a-4de7-b010-1f4dba410d4c", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "a57e7e15-ee67-4a2b-b868-fb9708d3cadd", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about enabling TLS encryption for Redis connections.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_EtqHgzMhUBZqg8VaGTCN0i', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'TLS|SSL|encryption|secure connection'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_B7dJUX3mbMLOScHbOCmEcn', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'enable TLS encryption Redis connections secure SSL', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_EtqHgzMhUBZqg8VaGTCN0i', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_B7dJUX3mbMLOScHbOCmEcn', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.327,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TLS\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"SSL/TLS is supported by Redis starting with version 6 as an optional feature\\\\\\\\nthat needs to be enabled at compile time.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8684,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TLS\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Getting Started > Limitations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Additional TLS configuration is available to control the choice of TLS protocol\\\\\\\\nversions, ciphers and cipher suites, etc. Please consult the self documented\\\\\\\\n`redis.conf` for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTLS adds a layer to the communication stack with overheads due to writing/reading to/from an SSL connection, encryption/decryption and integrity checks.

Lua 脚本调试\n\n**LDB (Lua Debugger)** — Redis 3.2+ 内置的完整 Lua 调试器：\n```bash\nredis-cli --ldb --eval /tmp/script.lua\n```\n\n主要调试命令：\n- `step` / `next` — 单步执行\n- `continue` — 运行到下一个断点\n- `break <line>` — 设置断点\n- `print <var>` — 查看变量值\n- `list` — 查看源代码\n- `redis <cmd>` — 执行 Redis 命令\n- `redis.debug()` — 在脚本中输出调试信息到控制台\n\n## 3. GDB 调试（崩溃分析）\n\n当 Redis 进程崩溃时：\n- 使用 `make noopt` 编译无优化版本（便于调试）\n- 用 GDB 附加到运行中的进程或分析 core dump 文件\n- 适用于需要深入分析内存状态和崩溃原因的场景\n\n## 4. 内存测试\n\n**redis-server --test-memory** — 内置内存测试工具，用于排查硬件 RAM 问题（很多崩溃实际是由损坏的 RAM 引起）\n\n## 5. 向量集调试（Vector Sets）\n\n针对向量搜索的专用调试命令：\n- `VSIM ... TRUTH` — 使用线性扫描验证结果准确性\n- `VGETATTR` — 检查元素属性（排查过滤器问题）\n- `VLINKS ... WITHSCORES` — 检查 HNSW 图的节点连接情况\n\n## 6. 日志与监控\n\n- `redis.log()` — 在 Lua 脚本或 Redis Stack 函数中写入日志\n- `SLOWLOG` — 查看慢查询日志（配合 CLIENT SETNAME 识别问题客户端）\n- Pub/Sub — 用于无法访问日志文件时的调试输出\n\n## 7. 性能与延迟排查\n\n参考 Redis 延迟故障排查指南（Latency Troubleshooting Guide）处理性能问题。\n\n---\n\n**来源**：\n- [redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md > CLIENT 命令](chunk_id: c5c59021-005)\n- [redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md](chunk_id: 81091cbf-000, 81091cbf-001, 81091cbf-003)\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/debugging.md](chunk_id: 41480601-000)\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/troubleshooting.md](chunk_id: 1d4c65d2-000)\n- [redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/troubleshooting.md](chunk_id: dacbe75d-000)", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/design-review.md", "docs/runbook/kubernetes-pod-crashloop.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/troubleshooting.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["latency", "slow", "memory", "debug", "MEMORY", "EVAL", "Lua", "script"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/design-review.md", "docs/runbook/kubernetes-pod-crashloop.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/troubleshooting.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "754d848d-c4fe-42c5-83f9-970754dd93b1", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "16b4ad41-6e41-4404-be6c-ceb1049720da", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来帮你检索 Redis debugging 相关的工具和命令。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_PugicHdgy0jRF4DHjf7kDK', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'debug|DEBUG|troubleshoot|diagnostic'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_O58IOB5GvaUiNYvqkiVBw2', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis debugging tools commands troubleshooting diagnostic', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_PugicHdgy0jRF4DHjf7kDK', content='Found 2 files\\ndocs/design-review.md\\ndocs/runbook/kubernetes-pod-crashloop.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_O58IOB5GvaUiNYvqkiVBw2', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.0615,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"dacbe75d\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"dacbe75d-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/troubleshooting.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Troubleshooting\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"See also\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Vector sets are approximate by design.

While `redis-cli` is the default debug client, any client can be used for debugging as long as it meets one of the following conditions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The client provides a native interface for setting the debug mode and controlling the debug session.\\\\\\\\n2. The client provides an interface for sending arbitrary commands over RESP.\\\\\\\\n3. The client allows sending raw messages to the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, the [Redis plugin](https://redis.com/blog/zerobrane-studio-plugin-for-redis-lua-scripts) for [ZeroBrane Studio](http://studio.zerobrane.com/) integrates with LDB using [redis-lua](https://github.com/nrk/redis-lua).

Let\\'s look at what some of the data returned represents:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **addr**: The client address, that is, the client IP and the remote port number it used to connect with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n* **fd**: The client socket file descriptor number.\\\\\\\\n* **name**: The client name as set by [`CLIENT SETNAME`]().\\\\\\\\n* **age**: The number of seconds the connection existed for.\\\\\\\\n* **idle**: The number of seconds the connection is idle.\\\\\\\\n* **flags**: The kind of client (N means normal client, check the [full list of flags]()).\\\\\\\\n* **omem**: The amount of memory used by the client for the output buffer.\\\\\\\\n* **cmd**: The last executed command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [[`CLIENT LIST`]()](/commands/client-list) documentation for the full listing of fields and their purpose.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you have the list of clients, you can close a client\\'s connection using the [`CLIENT KILL`]() command, specifying the client address as its argument.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe commands [`CLIENT SETNAME`]() and [`CLIENT GETNAME`]() can be used to set and get the connection name.

This option is useful in order to detect dead peers (clients that cannot be reached even if they look connected). Moreover, if there is network equipment between clients and servers that need to see some traffic in order to take the connection open, the option will prevent unexpected connection closed events.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.1259,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"41480601\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"41480601-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/debugging.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Debugging\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Compiling Redis without optimizations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis is developed with an emphasis on stability.

However, if you ever need to debug the Redis process itself, read on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis crashes, it produces a detailed report of what happened. However,\\\\\\\\nsometimes looking at the crash report is not enough, nor is it possible for\\\\\\\\nthe Redis core team to reproduce the issue independently. In this scenario, we\\\\\\\\nneed help from the user who can reproduce the issue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis guide shows how to use GDB to provide the information the\\\\\\\\nRedis developers will need to track the bug more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGDB is the Gnu Debugger: a program that is able to inspect the internal state\\\\\\\\nof another program. Usually tracking and fixing a bug is an exercise in\\\\\\\\ngathering more information about the state of the program at the moment the\\\\\\\\nbug happens, so GDB is an extremely useful tool.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGDB can be used in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It can attach to a running program and inspect the state of it at runtime.\\\\\\\\n* It can inspect the state of a program that already terminated using what is called a *core file*, that is, the image of the memory at the time the program was running.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of investigating Redis bugs we need to use both of these\\\\\\\\nGDB modes. The user able to reproduce the bug attaches GDB to their running Redis\\\\\\\\ninstance, and when the crash happens, they create the `core` file that in turn\\\\\\\\nthe developer will use to inspect the Redis internals at the time of the crash.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis way the developer can perform all the inspections in his or her computer\\\\\\\\nwithout the help of the user, and the user is free to restart Redis in their\\\\\\\\nproduction environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default Redis is compiled with the `-O2` switch, this means that compiler\\\\\\\\noptimizations are enabled. This makes the Redis executable faster, but at the\\\\\\\\nsame time it makes Redis (like any other program) harder to inspect using GDB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is better to attach GDB to Redis compiled without optimizations using the\\\\\\\\n`make noopt` command (instead of just using the plain `make` command). However,\\\\\\\\nif you have an already running Redis in production there is no need to recompile\\\\\\\\nand restart it if this is going to create problems on your side. GDB still works\\\\\\\\nagainst executables compiled with optimizations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not be overly concerned at the loss of performance from compiling Redis\\\\\\\\nwithout optimizations. It is unlikely that this will cause problems in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment as Redis is not very CPU-bound.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.2289,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1d4c65d2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1d4c65d2-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/troubleshooting.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Troubleshooting Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"List of known Linux related bugs affecting Redis.\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This page tries to help you with what to do if you have issues with Redis.

Create your script in some file with your preferred editor. Let\\'s assume you are editing your Redis Lua script located at `/tmp/script.lua`.\\\\\\\\n2. Start a debugging session with:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-cli --ldb --eval /tmp/script.lua\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that with the `--eval` option of `redis-cli` you can pass key names and arguments to the script, separated by a comma, like in the following example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n./redis-cli --ldb --eval /tmp/script.lua mykey somekey , arg1 arg2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll enter a special mode where `redis-cli` no longer accepts its normal\\\\\\\\ncommands, but instead prints a help screen and passes the unmodified debugging\\\\\\\\ncommands directly to Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe only commands which are not passed to the Redis debugger are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `quit` -- this will terminate the debugging session.\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s like removing all the breakpoints and using the `continue` debugging command.\\\\\\\\nMoreover the command will exit from `redis-cli`.\\\\\\\\n* `restart` -- the debugging session will restart from scratch, **reloading the new version of the script from the file**.\\\\\\\\nSo a normal debugging cycle involves modifying the script after some debugging, and calling `restart` in order to start debugging again with the new script changes.\\\\\\\\n* `help` -- this command is passed to the Redis Lua debugger, that will print a list of commands like the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nlua debugger> help\\\\\\\\nRedis Lua debugger help:\\\\\\\\n[h]elp               Show this help.\\\\\\\\n[s]tep               Run current line and stop again.\\\\\\\\n[n]ext               Alias for step.\\\\\\\\n[c]ontinue           Run till next breakpoint.\\\\\\\\n[l]ist               List source code around current line.\\\\\\\\n[l]ist [line]        List source code around [line].\\\\\\\\n                     line = 0 means: current position.\\\\\\\\n[l]ist [line] [ctx]  In this form [ctx] specifies how many lines\\\\\\\\n                     to show before/after [line].\\\\\\\\n[w]hole              List all source code.

However, there is a drawback. Redis Cloud users do not have access to the Redis log files, and it\\'s pretty common that only system administrators have access to them on self-hosted installations. Fortunately, you can also use Redis pub/sub, which will be discussed in the next section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou don\\'t have to do anything special to use `redis.log`, as it\\'s always available. Here is an example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```javascript\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=lib\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerFunction(\\'hello\\', ()=> {\\\\\\\\n  redis.log(\\'Hello log\\')\\\\\\\\n  return \\'Hello from an external file\\'\\\\\\\\n})\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter loading the library and executing the function with `TFCALL`, you\\'ll see something like the following in your Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n45718:M 01 Nov 2023 07:02:40.593 * <redisgears_2> Hello log\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you don\\'t have access to your Redis database log files, you can use pub/sub. The following example demonstrates how to use the [client.call]() API to publish to a pub/sub channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```javascript\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=lib\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nconst logChannel = \\'tfLogChannel\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nfunction publog(client, message) {\\\\\\\\n  client.call(\\'publish\\', logChannel, message)\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerFunction(\\'tflog\\', (client) => {\\\\\\\\n  publog(client, \\'sample pub/sub log message\\')\\\\\\\\n  return \\'sample\\'\\\\\\\\n})\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nIn a CLI session, subscribe to the `tfLogChannel` channel and watch for messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```redis\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> subscribe tfLogChannel\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"subscribe\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"tfLogChannel\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\nReading messages... (press Ctrl-C to quit or any key to type command)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn another CLI session, load the library, replacing what was already there, and then call the new function:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```redis\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFCALL lib.tflog 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sample\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll see the following in the previous CLI session:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```redis\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"tfLogChannel\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sample pub/sub log message\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a downside to using pub/sub. Redis pub/sub provides at-most-once message delivery semantics, which means that once a message is sent, it won\\'t be sent again. So, if a message isn\\'t consumed, it\\'s gone forever. This is likely okay for debugging, but for the longer term, `redis.log` is the better solution for log persistence.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.0794,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"81091cbf\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"81091cbf-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Debugging Lua scripts in Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with version 3.2 Redis includes a complete Lua debugger, that can be\\\\\\\\nused in order to make the task of writing complex Redis scripts much simpler.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Lua debugger, codenamed LDB, has the following important features:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It uses a server-client model, so it\\'s a remote debugger.\\\\\\\\nThe Redis server acts as the debugging server, while the default client is `redis-cli`. \\\\\\\\nHowever other clients can be developed by following the simple protocol implemented by the server.\\\\\\\\n* By default every new debugging session is a forked session.\\\\\\\\nIt means that while the Redis Lua script is being debugged, the server does not block and is usable for development or in order to execute multiple debugging sessions in parallel.\\\\\\\\nThis also means that changes are **rolled back** after the script debugging session finished, so that\\'s possible to restart a new debugging session again, using exactly the same Redis data set as the previous debugging session.\\\\\\\\n* An alternative synchronous (non forked) debugging model is available on demand, so that changes to the dataset can be retained.\\\\\\\\nIn this mode the server blocks for the time the debugging session is active.\\\\\\\\n* Support for step by step execution.\\\\\\\\n* Support for static and dynamic breakpoints.\\\\\\\\n* Support from logging the debugged script into the debugger console.\\\\\\\\n* Inspection of Lua variables.\\\\\\\\n* Tracing of Redis commands executed by the script.\\\\\\\\n* Pretty printing of Redis and Lua values.\\\\\\\\n* Infinite loops and long execution detection, which simulates a breakpoint.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='根据检索结果，Redis debugging 有以下常用工具和命令：\\n\\n## 1. 客户端管理与调试\\n\\n**CLIENT 命令系列** — 检查和管理客户端连接状态：\\n- `CLIENT LIST` — 列出所有连接的客户端及其状态（地址、文件描述符、空闲时间、执行的命令等）\\n- `CLIENT KILL` — 关闭指定客户端连接\\n- `CLIENT SETNAME` / `CLIENT GETNAME` — 设置/获取客户端连接名称（便于在 SLOWLOG 中识别）\\n\\n## 2.

Prepare and Backup\nBefore upgrading, create snapshots on each node:\n```bash\nredis-cli -p <port> SAVE\n```\n\nIdentify data directories:\n```bash\nredis-cli -p <port> CONFIG GET dir\n```\n\nMake copies of all data files (`dump.rdb` or `appendonly.aof.*`) before proceeding.\n\n### 2. Upgrade Replica Nodes First\nReplicas are straightforward:\n- Stop the replica node\n- Install Redis 8\n- Restart with the new version\n\nClients using replicas for read scaling will automatically reconnect to other available replicas during the upgrade.\n\n### 3. Upgrade Master Nodes (Zero-Downtime)\nFor each master, follow this procedure:\n\n1. **Trigger manual failover** to promote a replica to master:\n   ```bash\n   CLUSTER FAILOVER\n   ```\n\n2. **Wait** for the old master to become a replica\n\n3. **Upgrade** the node (now a replica) using the same process as other replicas\n\n4. **(Optional)** Trigger another manual failover to restore the upgraded node as master\n\n### 4. Verify the Upgrade\nAfter upgrading each node, verify:\n```bash\nredis-cli -p <port> INFO server | grep redis_version\nredis-cli -p <port> cluster info\nredis-cli --cluster check <IP address>:<port>\n```\n\nAlso verify data accessibility and client connectivity.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n⚠️ **Redis Query Engine**: Won't be fully operational until all master shards complete their upgrades. Queries during upgrade may return errors or \"Waiting for all nodes to connect\".\n\n⚠️ **Practice First**: Test the upgrade in a controlled environment (Docker recommended) before production.\n\n**Supported Upgrade Paths**:\n- Redis 7.x → Redis 8\n- Redis Stack 7.2/7.4 → Redis 8\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/upgrade/cluster.md

excellent tool to use for this purpose.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow these instructions to upgrade a Redis cluster. This guide assumes you have installed Redis using one of the supported methods listed [here]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore upgrading, create a snapshot of your current dataset on each node (identified by its port) using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> SAVE\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRepeat for every node in your cluster, both masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis creates or updates an `RDB` file, for example `dump.rdb`, in the node\\'s Redis data directory. If you use AOF persistence, the files will be named `appendonly.aof.*` and they will be written in the `appendonlydir` directory inside the data directory. The AOF-related directory and file names are the defaults. Use the names defined in your `redis.conf` file if different from the defaults.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the following command on each node to identify where your data directories are located:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> CONFIG GET dir\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake a copy of the files contained in each of those directories before proceeding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpgrade each node one at a time, starting with the replicas, using these steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Stop the current version of Redis Open Source or Redis Stack server.\\\\\\\\n1. Follow the installation steps that correspond to your [Redis distribution]() to install Redis 8.\\\\\\\\n1. Start Redis 8 if it didn\\'t start automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf necessary, restore the saved files to their original locations on each node. Then restart Redis on each node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Query Engine won\\'t be fully operational until all master shards have completed their upgrades.\\\\\\\\nAny queries sent during the upgrade process will either return errors or a message such as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Waiting for all nodes to connect\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> INFO server | grep redis_version\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> cluster info\\\\\\\\nredis-cli --cluster check <IP address>:<port>\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should also verify that your data is accessible and that your clients can connect successfully.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8464,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a21b6283\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a21b6283-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/install/upgrade-module.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Upgrade Module\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Upgrade a module for a database\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Upgrade a module in Redis Software to get the latest features and fixes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- If you upgrade a single-node cluster, it does not load the new modules that are bundled with the new cluster version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Before you upgrade a database with the RediSearch module enabled to Redis 5.0, you must upgrade the RediSearch module to version 1.4.2 or later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore you upgrade a module enabled in a database, [install the new version of the module on the cluster]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter you install an updated module on the cluster, you can upgrade databases to use the new module version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter you upgrade the module for a database, the database shards restart. This causes a short interruption in the availability of this database across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo upgrade a module enabled for a database:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Connect to the terminal of a node in the cluster.\\\\\\\\n1. Run `rladmin status` to list the databases on the node.\\\\\\\\n1.

To see the versions of the modules on the cluster, run either:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - `rladmin status modules` - Shows the latest modules available on the cluster and the modules used by databases.\\\\\\\\n    - `rladmin status modules all` - Shows all of the modules available on the cluster and the modules used by databases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. To upgrade a database to the latest version of Redis and its modules to the latest version without changing the module arguments:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - For clusters with Redis Software versions 7.8.2 or later, run:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        ```sh\\\\\\\\n        rladmin upgrade db < database-name | database-ID >\\\\\\\\n        ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - For clusters with versions earlier than 7.8.2, include the `latest_with_modules` option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        ```sh\\\\\\\\n        rladmin upgrade db < database-name | database-ID > latest_with_modules\\\\\\\\n        ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\nThe upgrade process does not validate the module upgrade arguments, and incorrect arguments can cause unexpected downtime. Test module upgrade commands in a test environment before you upgrade modules in production. \\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - Use `keep_redis_version` to upgrade the modules without upgrading the database to the latest Redis version.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n        `keep_redis_version` is deprecated as of Redis Software version 7.8.2. To upgrade modules without upgrading the Redis database version, set `redis_version` to the current Redis database version instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    - To specify the modules to upgrade, add the following for each module:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        ```sh\\\\\\\\n        and module module_name <module_name> version <new_module_version_number> module_args \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<module arguments>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n        ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        For the module arguments, use one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        - `module_args \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<module_arguments>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` to replace the existing module arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        - `module_args \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` without arguments to remove the existing module arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        - `module_args keep_args` to use the existing module arguments.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.7408,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-018\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Upgrade nodes in a Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Upgrading replica nodes is easy since you just need to stop the node and restart\\\\\\\\nit with an updated version of Redis.

The shutdown is scheduled and starts as soon as the current command completes (with a possible delay of ≤0.1 seconds).\n\n**Shutdown Process:**\n1. **Wait for replicas** (Redis 7.0+): Pauses write clients and waits up to `shutdown-timeout` (default 10 seconds) for lagging replicas to catch up with replication offset\n2. **Kill background processes**: Terminates any child process performing RDB save or AOF rewrite\n3. **Flush AOF**: If AOF is active, calls `fsync()` to flush buffers to disk\n4. **Synchronous RDB save**: If configured for RDB persistence, performs a blocking save (doesn't use extra memory)\n5. **Cleanup**: Removes PID file (if daemonized) and Unix domain socket (if enabled)\n6. **Exit**: Server exits with code 0\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- If RDB save fails, shutdown is aborted and server continues running to prevent data loss\n- If a long-running Lua script is blocking, use `SCRIPT KILL` first\n- Before Redis 7.0, shutting down a diskless master could cause data loss - consider using `FAILOVER` to demote the master first\n\n### Crash Signals\nThe following signals are treated as crashes:\n- **SIGSEGV** (segmentation fault)\n- **SIGBUS** (bus error)  \n- **SIGFPE** (floating point exception)\n- **SIGILL** (illegal instruction)\n\nWhen trapped, Redis:\n1. Logs a bug report with stack trace and client state\n2. Performs fast memory test (Redis 2.8+)\n3. Removes PID file if daemonized\n4.

When the server receives this signal,\\\\\\\\nit does not immediately exit. Instead, it schedules\\\\\\\\na shutdown similar to the one performed by the [`SHUTDOWN`](/commands/shutdown) command. The scheduled shutdown starts as soon as possible, specifically as long as the\\\\\\\\ncurrent command in execution terminates (if any), with a possible additional\\\\\\\\ndelay of 0.1 seconds or less.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the server is blocked by a long-running Lua script,\\\\\\\\nkill the script with [`SCRIPT KILL`](/commands/script-kill) if possible. The scheduled shutdown will\\\\\\\\nrun just after the script is killed or terminates spontaneously.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis shutdown process includes the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If there are any replicas lagging behind in replication:\\\\\\\\n  * Pause clients attempting to write with [`CLIENT PAUSE`](/commands/client-pause) and the `WRITE` option.\\\\\\\\n  * Wait up to the configured `shutdown-timeout` (default 10 seconds) for replicas to catch up with the master\\'s replication offset.\\\\\\\\n* If a background child is saving the RDB file or performing an AOF rewrite, the child process is killed.\\\\\\\\n* If the AOF is active, Redis calls the `fsync` system call on the AOF file descriptor to flush the buffers on disk.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis is configured to persist on disk using RDB files, a synchronous (blocking) save is performed. Since the save is synchronous, it doesn\\'t use any additional memory.\\\\\\\\n* If the server is daemonized, the PID file is removed.\\\\\\\\n* If the Unix domain socket is enabled, it gets removed.\\\\\\\\n* The server exits with an exit code of zero.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIF the RDB file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails, and the server continues to run in order to ensure no data loss.\\\\\\\\nLikewise, if the user just turned on AOF, and the server triggered the first AOF rewrite in order to create the initial AOF file but this file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails and the server continues to run.\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.6.11, no further attempt to shut down will be made unless a new `SIGTERM` is received or the [`SHUTDOWN`](/commands/shutdown) command is issued.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 7.0, the server waits for lagging replicas up to a configurable `shutdown-timeout`, 10 seconds by default, before shutting down.\\\\\\\\nThis provides a best effort to minimize the risk of data loss in a situation where no save points are configured and AOF is deactivated.\\\\\\\\nBefore version 7.0, shutting down a heavily loaded master node in a diskless setup was more likely to result in data loss.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risk of data loss in such setups, trigger a manual [`FAILOVER`](/commands/failover) (or [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)) to demote the master to a replica and promote one of the replicas to a new master before shutting down a master node.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.7774,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis signal handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Kill the RDB file without errors\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The following signals are handled as a Redis crash:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* SIGSEGV\\\\\\\\n* SIGBUS\\\\\\\\n* SIGFPE\\\\\\\\n* SIGILL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce one of these signals is trapped, Redis stops any current operation and performs the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Adds a bug report to the log file.

This is especially true with Pub/Sub clients in case a client is not\\\\\\\\nable to process new messages fast enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth conditions will cause the client output buffer to grow and consume\\\\\\\\nmore and more memory. For this reason by default Redis sets limits to the\\\\\\\\noutput buffer size for different kind of clients. When the limit is reached\\\\\\\\nthe client connection is closed and the event logged in the Redis log file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two kind of limits Redis uses:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The **hard limit** is a fixed limit that when reached will make Redis close the client connection as soon as possible.\\\\\\\\n* The **soft limit** instead is a limit that depends on the time, for instance a soft limit of 32 megabytes per 10 seconds means that if the client has an output buffer bigger than 32 megabytes for, continuously, 10 seconds, the connection gets closed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDifferent kind of clients have different default limits:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Normal clients** have a default limit of 0, that means, no limit at all, because most normal clients use blocking implementations sending a single command and waiting for the reply to be completely read before sending the next command, so it is always not desirable to close the connection in case of a normal client.\\\\\\\\n* **Pub/Sub clients** have a default hard limit of 32 megabytes and a soft limit of 8 megabytes per 60 seconds.\\\\\\\\n* **Replicas** have a default hard limit of 256 megabytes and a soft limit of 64 megabyte per 60 seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to change the limit at runtime using the [`CONFIG SET`]() command or in a permanent way using the Redis configuration file `redis.conf`. See the example `redis.conf` in the Redis distribution for more information about how to set the limit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery client is also subject to a query buffer limit. This is a non-configurable hard limit that will close the connection when the client query buffer (that is the buffer we use to accumulate commands from the client) reaches 1 GB, and is actually only an extreme limit to avoid a server crash in case of client or server software bugs.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.1677,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis client handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"What Order are Client Requests Served In?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This document provides information about how Redis handles clients at the network layer level: connections, timeouts, buffers, and other similar topics are covered here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe information contained in this document is **only applicable to Redis version 2.6 or greater**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis accepts clients connections on the configured TCP port and on the Unix socket if enabled. When a new client connection is accepted the following operations are performed:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client socket is put in the non-blocking state since Redis uses multiplexing and non-blocking I/O.\\\\\\\\n* The `TCP_NODELAY` option is set in order to ensure that there are no delays to the connection.\\\\\\\\n* A *readable* file event is created so that Redis is able to collect the client queries as soon as new data is available to read on the socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the client is initialized, Redis checks if it is already at the limit\\\\\\\\nconfigured for the number of simultaneous clients (configured using the `maxclients` configuration directive, see the next section of this document for further information).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis can\\'t accept a new client connection because the maximum number of clients\\\\\\\\nhas been reached, it tries to send an error to the client in order to\\\\\\\\nmake it aware of this condition, closing the connection immediately.\\\\\\\\nThe error message will reach the client even if the connection is\\\\\\\\nclosed immediately by Redis because the new socket output buffer is usually\\\\\\\\nbig enough to contain the error, so the kernel will handle transmission\\\\\\\\nof the error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe order is determined by a combination of the client socket file descriptor\\\\\\\\nnumber and order in which the kernel reports events, so the order should be \\\\\\\\nconsidered as unspecified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, Redis does the following two things when serving clients:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It only performs a single `read()` system call every time there is something new to read from the client socket. This ensures that if we have multiple clients connected, and a few send queries at a high rate, other clients are not penalized and will not experience latency issues.\\\\\\\\n* However once new data is read from a client, all the queries contained in the current buffers are processed sequentially. This improves locality and does not need iterating a second time to see if there are clients that need some processing time.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.2477,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis client handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Client Timeouts\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"By default recent versions of Redis don\\'t close the connection with the client\\\\\\\\nif the client is idle for many seconds: the connection will remain open forever.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever if you don\\'t like this behavior, you can configure a timeout, so that\\\\\\\\nif the client is idle for more than the specified number of seconds, the client connection will be closed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can configure this limit via `redis.conf` or simply using `CONFIG SET timeout <value>`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the timeout only applies to normal clients and it **does not apply to Pub/Sub clients**, since a Pub/Sub connection is a *push style* connection so a client that is idle is the norm.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if by default connections are not subject to timeout, there are two conditions when it makes sense to set a timeout:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Mission critical applications where a bug in the client software may saturate the Redis server with idle connections, causing service disruption.\\\\\\\\n* As a debugging mechanism in order to be able to connect with the server if a bug in the client software saturates the server with idle connections, making it impossible to interact with the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTimeouts are not to be considered very precise: Redis avoids setting timer events or running O(N) algorithms in order to check idle clients, so the check is performed incrementally from time to time. This means that it is possible that while the timeout is set to 10 seconds, the client connection will be closed, for instance, after 12 seconds if many clients are connected at the same time.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.4303,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021-005\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis client handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"TCP keepalive\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis [`CLIENT`]() command allows you to inspect the state of every connected client, to kill a specific client, and to name connections.

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.6657,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Appendix: Why are busy loops slow even on the loopback interface?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In the following benchmark we\\'ll use the Redis Ruby client, supporting pipelining, to test the speed improvement due to pipelining:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```ruby\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'rubygems\\'\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'redis\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef bench(descr)\\\\\\\\n  start = Time.now\\\\\\\\n  yield\\\\\\\\n  puts \\\\\\\\\\\\\"#{descr} #{Time.now -

The wise thing is just avoiding\\\\\\\\nbenchmarking in this way.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.5404,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"It\\'s not just a matter of RTT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Request/Response server can be implemented so that it is able to process new requests even if the client hasn\\'t already read the old responses.\\\\\\\\nThis way it is possible to send *multiple commands* to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use for many decades.\\\\\\\\nFor instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has supported pipelining since its early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.\\\\\\\\nThis is an example using the raw netcat utility:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash \\\\\\\\n$ (printf \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; sleep 1) | nc localhost 6379\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time we don\\'t pay the cost of RTT for every call, but just once for the three commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be explicit, with pipelining the order of operations of our very first example will be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the client sends commands using pipelining, the server will be forced to queue the replies, using memory. So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8042,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"fc275d19\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"fc275d19-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/benchmarks/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis benchmark\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Other Redis benchmarking tools\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"It is critically important that Redis performance is retained or improved seamlessly on every released version. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo assess it, we\\'ve conducted benchmarks on the released versions of Redis (starting on v2.6.0) using `redis-benchmark` on a series of command types over a standalone redis-server, repeating the same benchmark multiple times, ensuring its statistical significance, and measuring the run-to-run variance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe used hardware platform was a stable bare-metal HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 Server, with one Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6230 CPU @ 2.10GHz, disabling Intel HT Technology, disabling CPU Frequency scaling, with all configurable BIOS and CPU system settings set to performance. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe box was running Ubuntu 18.04 Linux release 4.15.0-123, and Redis was compiled with gcc 7.5.0.\\\\\\\\nThe used benchmark client (`redis-benchmark`) was kept stable across all tests, with version `redis-benchmark 6.2.0 (git:445aa844)`.\\\\\\\\nBoth the redis-server and redis-benchmark processes were pinned to specific physical cores.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following benchmark options were used across tests:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The tests were done with 50 simultaneous clients performing 5 million requests.\\\\\\\\n* Tests were executed using the loopback interface.\\\\\\\\n* Tests were executed without pipelining.\\\\\\\\n* The used payload size was 256 Bytes.\\\\\\\\n* For each redis-benchmark process, 2 threads were used to ensure that the benchmark client was not the bottleneck.\\\\\\\\n* Strings, Hashes, Sets, and Sorted Sets data types were benchmarked.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow we present the obtained results, broken by data type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Strings performance over versions](./performance-strings.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Hashes performance over versions](./performance-hashes.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Sets performance over versions](./performance-sets.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Sorted sets performance over versions](./performance-sorted-sets.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are several third-party tools that can be used for benchmarking Redis.

Default Mode (Memory-based tracking)**\n- Server remembers which keys each client accessed\n- Sends invalidation messages only for keys the client might have cached\n- Costs memory on server side but is more efficient with invalidation messages\n\n**2. Broadcasting Mode**\n- Server doesn't track individual client access\n- Zero memory cost on server side\n- Clients subscribe to key prefixes (e.g., `object:`, `user:`)\n- Receives notifications for all keys matching subscribed prefixes\n\n## How Tracking Works\n\n1. **Enable tracking**: `CLIENT TRACKING ON`\n2. **Server tracks reads**: When client requests keys (e.g., `GET foo`), server remembers this\n3. **Invalidation on modification**: When a key is modified, evicted, or expires, server sends invalidation messages to all tracking clients\n4. **Client evicts cache**: Clients must remove invalidated keys to avoid serving stale data\n\n**Example protocol flow:**\n```\nClient 1 -> Server: CLIENT TRACKING ON\nClient 1 -> Server: GET foo\n(Server remembers Client 1 may have \"foo\" cached)\nClient 2 -> Server: SET foo SomeOtherValue\nServer -> Client 1: INVALIDATE \"foo\"\n```\n\n## Key Implementation Details\n\n**Invalidation Table**: Server uses a global table with maximum entries. When full, it evicts old entries by sending fake invalidation messages to reclaim memory.\n\n**Client IDs**: Uses numerical IDs instead of pointers for efficient garbage collection when clients disconnect.\n\n**Single namespace**: Ignores database numbers - invalidation for `foo` in DB 2 triggers for `foo` in DB 3 as well.\n\n## Connection Models\n\n**RESP3 (Redis 6+)**: Single connection for both data queries and invalidation messages\n\n**RESP2 (Two-connection mode)**: \n- One connection for data queries\n- One connection for invalidation messages via Pub/Sub (`__redis__:invalidate` channel)\n- Use `CLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT <client-id>` to redirect invalidations\n\n## Broadcasting Mode Usage\n\n```\nCLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 10 BCAST PREFIX object: PREFIX user:\n```\n- Subscribe to specific prefixes\n- Empty prefix = receive invalidations for all keys\n- Prefixes cannot overlap (e.g., can't have both \"foo\" and \"foob\")\n\n## NOLOOP Option\n\nPrevents clients from receiving invalidation messages for keys they just modified - useful when clients cache their own writes locally.\n\n## Race Condition Handling\n\nWhen using two connections, invalidation messages may arrive before GET responses. Solution:\n1. Set placeholder value when sending GET\n2. If invalidation arrives, delete from cache\n3. Don't cache the response if entry is missing\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md > The Redis implementation of client-side caching, Two connections mode, The NOLOOP option, Other hints for implementing client libraries]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["user", "memory", "OBJECT", "MEMORY", "client-side", "caching", "invalidat"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "1a0f4445-4470-4b05-a893-80acfe5f1fdc", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "a73a9ed0-466f-424b-bf62-0ac765af2f19", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis client-side caching mechanism and invalidation using both keyword search and semantic search.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_OscdJ5vR3z5Yx6SQgMtw1B', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'client-side caching|client caching|invalidation'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_BfP6cgHbAQhf8QdMr8Bm4L', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis client-side caching mechanism invalidation tracking', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_OscdJ5vR3z5Yx6SQgMtw1B', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_BfP6cgHbAQhf8QdMr8Bm4L', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 6.1017,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis implementation of client-side caching\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis client-side caching support is called _Tracking_, and has two modes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* In the default mode, the server remembers what keys a given client accessed, and sends invalidation messages when the same keys are modified. This costs memory in the server side, but sends invalidation messages only for the set of keys that the client might have in memory.\\\\\\\\n* In the _broadcasting_ mode, the server does not attempt to remember what keys a given client accessed, so this mode costs no memory at all in the server side. Instead clients subscribe to key prefixes such as `object:` or `user:`, and receive a notification message every time a key matching a subscribed prefix is touched.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo recap, for now let\\'s forget for a moment about the broadcasting mode, to\\\\\\\\nfocus on the first mode. We\\'ll describe broadcasting in more detail later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Clients can enable tracking if they want. Connections start without tracking enabled.\\\\\\\\n2. When tracking is enabled, the server remembers what keys each client requested during the connection lifetime (by sending read commands about such keys).\\\\\\\\n3. When a key is modified by some client, or is evicted because it has an associated expire time, or evicted because of a _maxmemory_ policy, all the clients with tracking enabled that may have the key cached, are notified with an _invalidation message_.\\\\\\\\n4. When clients receive invalidation messages, they are required to remove the corresponding keys, in order to avoid serving stale data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of the protocol:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: CLIENT TRACKING ON\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: GET foo\\\\\\\\n* (The server remembers that Client 1 may have the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" cached)\\\\\\\\n* (Client 1 may remember the value of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" inside its local memory)\\\\\\\\n* Client 2 `->` Server: SET foo SomeOtherValue\\\\\\\\n* Server `->` Client 1: INVALIDATE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis looks great superficially, but if you imagine 10k connected clients all\\\\\\\\nasking for millions of keys over long living connection, the server ends up\\\\\\\\nstoring too much information. For this reason Redis uses two key ideas in\\\\\\\\norder to limit the amount of memory used server-side and the CPU cost of\\\\\\\\nhandling the data structures implementing the feature:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The server remembers the list of clients that may have cached a given key in a single global table. This table is called the **Invalidation Table**. The invalidation table can contain a maximum number of entries. If a new key is inserted, the server may evict an older entry by pretending that such key was modified (even if it was not), and sending an invalidation message to the clients. Doing so, it can reclaim the memory used for this key, even if this will force the clients having a local copy of the key to evict it.\\\\\\\\n* Inside the invalidation table we don\\'t really need to store pointers to clients\\' structures, that would force a garbage collection procedure when the client disconnects: instead what we do is just store client IDs (each Redis client has a unique numerical ID). If a client disconnects, the information will be incrementally garbage collected as caching slots are invalidated.\\\\\\\\n* There is a single keys namespace, not divided by database numbers. So if a client is caching the key `foo` in database 2, and some other client changes the value of the key `foo` in database 3, an invalidation message will still be sent. This way we can ignore database numbers reducing both the memory usage and the implementation complexity.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.1171,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"The NOLOOP option\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"So far we described the first client-side caching model that Redis implements.\\\\\\\\nThere is another one, called broadcasting, that sees the problem from the\\\\\\\\npoint of view of a different tradeoff, does not consume any memory on the\\\\\\\\nserver side, but instead sends more invalidation messages to clients.\\\\\\\\nIn this mode we have the following main behaviors:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients enable client-side caching using the `BCAST` option, specifying one or more prefixes using the `PREFIX` option. For instance: `CLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 10 BCAST PREFIX object: PREFIX user:`. If no prefix is specified at all, the prefix is assumed to be the empty string, so the client will receive invalidation messages for every key that gets modified. Instead if one or more prefixes are used, only keys matching one of the specified prefixes will be sent in the invalidation messages.\\\\\\\\n* The server does not store anything in the invalidation table. Instead it uses a different **Prefixes Table**, where each prefix is associated to a list of clients.\\\\\\\\n* No two prefixes can track overlapping parts of the keyspace. For instance, having the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foob\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would not be allowed, since they would both trigger an invalidation for the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foobar\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, just using the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is sufficient.\\\\\\\\n* Every time a key matching any of the prefixes is modified, all the clients subscribed to that prefix, will receive the invalidation message.\\\\\\\\n* The server will consume CPU proportional to the number of registered prefixes. If you have just a few, it is hard to see any difference. With a big number of prefixes the CPU cost can become quite large.\\\\\\\\n* In this mode the server can perform the optimization of creating a single reply for all the clients subscribed to a given prefix, and send the same reply to all. This helps to lower the CPU usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default client-side tracking will send invalidation messages to the\\\\\\\\nclient that modified the key. Sometimes clients want this, since they\\\\\\\\nimplement very basic logic that does not involve automatically caching\\\\\\\\nwrites locally. However, more advanced clients may want to cache even the\\\\\\\\nwrites they are doing in the local in-memory table. In such case receiving\\\\\\\\nan invalidation message immediately after the write is a problem, since it\\\\\\\\nwill force the client to evict the value it just cached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this case it is possible to use the `NOLOOP` option: it works both\\\\\\\\nin normal and broadcasting mode. Using this option, clients are able to\\\\\\\\ntell the server they don\\'t want to receive invalidation messages for keys\\\\\\\\nthat they modified.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7535,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Two connections mode\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Using the new version of the Redis protocol, RESP3, supported by Redis 6, it is possible to run the data queries and receive the invalidation messages in the same connection. However many client implementations may prefer to implement client-side caching using two separated connections: one for data, and one for invalidation messages. For this reason when a client enables tracking, it can specify to redirect the invalidation messages to another connection by specifying the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"client ID\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of a different connection. Many data connections can redirect invalidation messages to the same connection, this is useful for clients implementing connection pooling. The two connections model is the only one that is also supported for RESP2 (which lacks the ability to multiplex different kind of information in the same connection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of a complete session using the Redis protocol in the old RESP2 mode involving the following steps: enabling tracking redirecting to another connection, asking for a key, and getting an invalidation message once the key gets modified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo start, the client opens a first connection that will be used for invalidations, requests the connection ID, and subscribes via Pub/Sub to the special channel that is used to get invalidation messages when in RESP2 modes (remember that RESP2 is the usual Redis protocol, and not the more advanced protocol that you can use, optionally, with Redis 6 using the [`HELLO`]() command):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT ID\\\\\\\\n:4\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE __redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$9\\\\\\\\nsubscribe\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow we can enable tracking from the data connection:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 2 -- data connection)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 4\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGET foo\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nbar\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client may decide to cache `\\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" => \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` in the local memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA different client will now modify the value of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" key:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Some other unrelated connection)\\\\\\\\nSET foo bar\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result, the invalidations connection will receive a message that invalidates the specified key.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$7\\\\\\\\nmessage\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*1\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nfoo\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe client will check if there are cached keys in this caching slot, and will evict the information that is no longer valid.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the third element of the Pub/Sub message is not a single key but\\\\\\\\nis a Redis array with just a single element. Since we send an array, if there\\\\\\\\nare groups of keys to invalidate, we can do that in a single message.\\\\\\\\nIn case of a flush ([`FLUSHALL`]() or [`FLUSHDB`]()), a `null` message will be sent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA very important thing to understand about client-side caching used with\\\\\\\\nRESP2 and a Pub/Sub connection in order to read the invalidation messages,\\\\\\\\nis that using Pub/Sub is entirely a trick **in order to reuse old client\\\\\\\\nimplementations**, but actually the message is not really sent to a channel\\\\\\\\nand received by all the clients subscribed to it. Only the connection we\\\\\\\\nspecified in the `REDIRECT` argument of the [`CLIENT`]() command will actually\\\\\\\\nreceive the Pub/Sub message, making the feature a lot more scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen RESP3 is used instead, invalidation messages are sent (either in the\\\\\\\\nsame connection, or in the secondary connection when redirection is used)\\\\\\\\nas `push` messages (read the RESP3 specification for more information).\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.1247,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"There are two hard problems in computer science...\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A problem with the above pattern is how to invalidate the information that\\\\\\\\nthe application is holding, in order to avoid presenting stale data to the\\\\\\\\nuser.

So we\\'ll keep serving a stale version of the\\\\\\\\nfoo key. To avoid this problem, it is a good idea to populate the cache\\\\\\\\nwhen we send the command with a placeholder:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: set the local copy of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"caching-in-progress\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    [D] client-> server: GET foo.\\\\\\\\n    [I] server -> client: Invalidate foo (somebody else touched it)\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: delete \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the local cache.\\\\\\\\n    [D] server -> client: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the reply of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GET foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: don\\'t set \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\" since the entry for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is missing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSuch a race condition is not possible when using a single connection for both\\\\\\\\ndata and invalidation messages, since the order of the messages is always known\\\\\\\\nin that case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, if we lost the connection with the socket we use in order to\\\\\\\\nget the invalidation messages, we may end with stale data. In order to avoid\\\\\\\\nthis problem, we need to do the following things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure that if the connection is lost, the local cache is flushed.\\\\\\\\n2. Both when using RESP2 with Pub/Sub, or RESP3, ping the invalidation channel periodically (you can send PING commands even when the connection is in Pub/Sub mode!). If the connection looks broken and we are not able to receive ping backs, after a maximum amount of time, close the connection and flush the cache.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients may want to run internal statistics about the number of times\\\\\\\\na given cached key was actually served in a request, to understand in the\\\\\\\\nfuture what is good to cache. In general:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that change continuously.\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that are requested very rarely.\\\\\\\\n* We want to cache keys that are requested often and change at a reasonable rate. For an example of key not changing at a reasonable rate, think of a global counter that is continuously [`INCR`]()emented.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever simpler clients may just evict data using some random sampling just\\\\\\\\nremembering the last time a given cached value was served, trying to evict\\\\\\\\nkeys that were not served recently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Handling TTLs: make sure you also request the key TTL and set the TTL in the local cache if you want to support caching keys with a TTL.\\\\\\\\n* Putting a max TTL on every key is a good idea, even if it has no TTL. This protects against bugs or connection issues that would make the client have old data in the local copy.\\\\\\\\n* Limiting the amount of memory used by clients is absolutely needed.

Load the script once:\n```\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \"return 'Immabe a cached script'\"\n\"c664a3bf70bd1d45c4284ffebb65a6f2299bfc9f\"\n```\n\n2.

are blocked during script execution\n- **Data locality**: Logic executes where data lives, reducing latency\n- **Conditional updates**: Can perform complex operations across multiple keys and data types\n\n## Script Flags (Redis 7.0+)\n\nDeclare script behavior using shebang:\n\n```\n#!lua flags=no-writes,allow-stale\nlocal x = redis.call('get','x')\nreturn x\n```\n\n[来源:

very efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis guarantees the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\nWhile executing the script, all server activities are blocked during its entire runtime.\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripting offers several properties that can be valuable in many cases.\\\\\\\\nThese include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Providing locality by executing logic where data lives. Data locality reduces overall latency and saves networking resources.\\\\\\\\n* Blocking semantics that ensure the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\n* Enabling the composition of simple capabilities that are either missing from Redis or are too niche to be a part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLua lets you run part of your application logic inside Redis.\\\\\\\\nSuch scripts can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine.\\\\\\\\nPresently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference]() page for complete documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough the server executes them, Eval scripts are regarded as a part of the client-side application, which is why they\\'re not named, versioned, or persisted.\\\\\\\\nSo all scripts may need to be reloaded by the application at any time if missing (after a server restart, fail-over to a replica, etc.).\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, [Redis Functions]() offer an alternative approach to programmability which allow the server itself to be extended with additional programmed logic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll start scripting with Redis by using the [`EVAL`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s our first example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello, scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, [`EVAL`]() takes two arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe first argument is a string that consists of the script\\'s Lua source code.\\\\\\\\nThe script doesn\\'t need to include any definitions of Lua function.\\\\\\\\nIt is just a Lua program that will run in the Redis engine\\'s context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second argument is the number of arguments that follow the script\\'s body, starting from the third argument, representing Redis key names.\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we used the value _0_ because we didn\\'t provide the script with any arguments, whether the names of keys or not.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.983,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis functions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Prologue (or, what\\'s wrong with Eval Scripts?)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Functions is an API for managing code to be executed on the server. This feature, which became available in Redis 7, supersedes the use of [EVAL]() in prior versions of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior versions of Redis made scripting available only via the [`EVAL`]() command, which allows a Lua script to be sent for execution by the server.\\\\\\\\nThe core use cases for [Eval Scripts]() is executing part of your application logic inside Redis, efficiently and atomically.\\\\\\\\nSuch script can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing [`EVAL`]() requires that the application sends the entire script for execution every time.\\\\\\\\nBecause this results in network and script compilation overheads, Redis provides an optimization in the form of the [`EVALSHA`]() command. By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes to already-established and well-liked ephemeral scripts, Redis v7.0 introduces Redis Functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.9816,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

[`redis.pcall()`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two are nearly identical.\\\\\\\\nBoth execute a Redis command along with its provided arguments, if these represent a well-formed command.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as generic as possible and provide customized execution via their arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA script is loaded to the server\\'s cache by calling the [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() command and providing its source code.\\\\\\\\nThe server doesn\\'t execute the script, but instead just compiles and loads it to the server\\'s cache.\\\\\\\\nOnce loaded, you can execute the cached script with the SHA1 digest returned from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example

encountered in the script that uses additional memory will cause the script to abort (unless [`redis.pcall`]() was used).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, an exception to the above is when the script\\'s first write command does not use additional memory, as is the case with  (for example, [`DEL`]() and [`LREM`]()).\\\\\\\\nIn this case, Redis will allow all commands in the script to run to ensure atomicity.\\\\\\\\nIf subsequent writes in the script consume additional memory, Redis\\' memory usage can exceed the threshold set by the `maxmemory` configuration directive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother scenario in which a script can cause memory usage to cross the `maxmemory` threshold is when the execution begins when Redis is slightly below `maxmemory`, so the script\\'s first write command is allowed.\\\\\\\\nAs the script executes, subsequent write commands consume more memory leading to the server using more RAM than the configured `maxmemory` directive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn those scenarios, you should consider setting the `maxmemory-policy` configuration directive to any values other than `noeviction`.\\\\\\\\nIn addition, Lua scripts should be as fast as possible so that eviction can kick in between executions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that you can change this behaviour by using [flags](#eval-flags)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally, when you run an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nHowever, starting with Redis 7.0, there\\'s a way to declare flags when creating a script in order to tell Redis how it should behave.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe way to do that is by using a Shebang statement on the first line of the script like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n#!lua flags=no-writes,allow-stale\\\\\\\\nlocal x = redis.call(\\'get\\',\\'x\\')\\\\\\\\nreturn x\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that as soon as Redis sees the `#!` comment, it\\'ll treat the script as if it declares flags, even if no flags are defined,\\\\\\\\nit still has a different set of defaults compared to a script without a `#!` line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother difference is that scripts without `#!` can run commands that access keys belonging to different cluster hash slots, but ones with `#!` inherit the default flags, so they cannot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to [Script flags]() to learn about the various scripts and the defaults.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5281,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

Instead, it evicts keys **reactively** when memory exceeds the limit:\n\n1. **Trigger**: When a client runs a command that adds new data, Redis checks if memory usage exceeds `maxmemory`\n2. **Eviction**: If over the limit, Redis evicts keys according to your `maxmemory-policy` until memory drops back below the limit\n3. **Temporary spikes**: Commands that add lots of data (e.g., large set intersections) can temporarily exceed the limit by a large amount\n\n## Why Keys Keep Growing\n\nIf your keys keep growing despite `maxmemory` being set, check:\n\n- **Eviction policy**: If set to `noeviction` (default in some cases), Redis will **refuse new writes** but won't evict existing keys. You'll get errors instead.\n- **Replication/persistence buffers**: Memory used for replication or AOF buffers is **not counted** toward `maxmemory`. Use `INFO memory` to check `mem_not_counted_for_evict`.\n\n## Available Eviction Policies\n\nConfigure with `maxmemory-policy`:\n\n**All keys:**\n- `allkeys-lru`: Evict least recently used keys (good default)\n- `allkeys-lrm`: Evict least recently modified keys (Redis 8.6+, preserves frequently read data)\n- `allkeys-lfu`: Evict least frequently used keys\n- `allkeys-random`: Random eviction\n\n**Keys with TTL only:**\n- `volatile-lru/lrm/lfu/random`: Same as above, but only for keys with expiration set\n- `volatile-ttl`: Evict keys with shortest remaining TTL\n\n**No eviction:**\n- `noeviction`: Return errors on new writes (keys won't shrink)\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf keys are growing uncontrollably, you likely have `noeviction` set. Change to `allkeys-lru`:\n\n```bash\nCONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru\n```\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md > Using the `maxmemory` configuration directive, Eviction policies]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["eviction", "maxmemory", "policy", "replica", "AOF", "KEYS", "memory"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "4d28643a-2c92-4778-8b18-81457767db63", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "033106cc-db2b-4e1b-b2fc-758cd711461d", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis memory management and eviction policies.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_riH9uhi4Uzmyq0OrfYaGOJ', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis maxmemory eviction policy keys growing memory management', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_ruX9vQ5Lvr0hIdKBFCOzfY', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'maxmemory|eviction'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_riH9uhi4Uzmyq0OrfYaGOJ', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.1264,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Using the `maxmemory` configuration directive {#maxmem}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis is commonly used as a cache to speed up read accesses to a slower server\\\\\\\\nor database.

You can\\\\\\\\nset `maxmemory` with the [`redis.conf`](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.4.0/redis.conf)\\\\\\\\nfile at startup time. For example, to configure a memory limit of 100 megabytes,\\\\\\\\nyou can use the following directive inside `redis.conf`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nmaxmemory 100mb\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also use [`CONFIG SET`]() to\\\\\\\\nset `maxmemory` at runtime using [`redis-cli`]():\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\n> CONFIG SET maxmemory 100mb\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet `maxmemory` to zero to specify that you don\\'t want to limit the memory\\\\\\\\nfor the dataset.

This is a very common case according to the\\\\\\\\n    [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), so\\\\\\\\n    `allkeys-lru` is a good default option if you have no reason to prefer any others.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-lrm` when you want to preserve frequently read data but evict data\\\\\\\\n    that hasn\\'t been modified recently. This is useful for read-heavy workloads where\\\\\\\\n    you want to distinguish between data that\\'s actively being updated versus data\\\\\\\\n    that\\'s only being read.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-random` when you expect all keys to be accessed with roughly equal\\\\\\\\n    frequency. An example of this is when your app reads data items in a repeating cycle.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `volatile-ttl` if your code can estimate which keys are good candidates for eviction\\\\\\\\n    and assign short TTLs to them. Note also that if you make good use of\\\\\\\\n    key expiration, then you are less likely to run into the cache memory limit because keys\\\\\\\\n    will often expire before they need to be evicted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `volatile-lru`, `volatile-lrm`, and `volatile-random` policies are mainly useful when you want to use\\\\\\\\na single Redis instance for both caching and for a set of persistent keys. However,\\\\\\\\nyou should consider running two separate Redis instances in a case like this, if possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that setting an `expire` value for a key costs memory, so a\\\\\\\\npolicy like `allkeys-lru` is more memory efficient since it doesn\\'t need an\\\\\\\\n`expire` value to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.283,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"LRM eviction {#lrm-eviction}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with Redis 8.6, the Least Recently Modified (LRM) eviction policy is available.

This improves the performance of the algorithm, making\\\\\\\\nit a close approximation to a true LRU algorithm.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(Redis Open Source only) You can tune the performance of the algorithm by changing the number of samples to check\\\\\\\\nbefore every eviction with the `maxmemory-samples` configuration directive:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nmaxmemory-samples 5\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee these pages for information on eviction policies in: (1) [Redis Software]() and (2) [Redis Cloud]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason Redis does not use a true LRU implementation is because it\\\\\\\\ncosts more memory. However, the approximation is virtually equivalent for an\\\\\\\\napplication using Redis. This figure compares\\\\\\\\nthe LRU approximation used by Redis with true LRU.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![LRU comparison](lru_comparison.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe test to generate the above graphs filled a Redis server with a given number of keys. The keys were accessed from the first to the last. The first keys are the best candidates for eviction using an LRU algorithm. Later more 50% of keys are added, in order to force half of the old keys to be evicted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can see three kind of dots in the graphs, forming three distinct bands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The light gray band are objects that were evicted.\\\\\\\\n* The gray band are objects that were not evicted.\\\\\\\\n* The green band are objects that were added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn a theoretical LRU implementation we expect that, among the old keys, the first half will be expired. The Redis LRU algorithm will instead only *probabilistically* expire the older keys.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see Redis 3.0 does a better job with 5 samples compared to Redis 2.8, however most objects that are among the latest accessed are still retained by Redis 2.8. Using a sample size of 10 in Redis 3.0 the approximation is very close to the theoretical performance of Redis 3.0.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that LRU is just a model to predict how likely a given key will be accessed in the future. Moreover, if your data access pattern closely\\\\\\\\nresembles the power law, most of the accesses will be in the set of keys\\\\\\\\nthe LRU approximated algorithm can handle well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn simulations we found that using a power law access pattern, the difference between true LRU and Redis approximation were minimal or non-existent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever you can raise the sample size to 10 at the cost of some additional CPU\\\\\\\\nusage to closely approximate true LRU, and check if this makes a\\\\\\\\ndifference in your cache misses rate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo experiment in production with different values for the sample size by using\\\\\\\\nthe `CONFIG SET maxmemory-samples <count>` command, is very simple.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_ruX9vQ5Lvr0hIdKBFCOzfY', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Based on the Redis documentation, here's how eviction works when `maxmemory` is set:\\n\\n## How Redis Eviction Works\\n\\nWhen you set `maxmemory`, Redis **does not prevent keys from growing**.

replica 与 master 断连时间超过 `(down-after-milliseconds * 10) + master 进入 SDOWN 状态的时长` 会被认为不可靠，直接跳过\n   \n2. **replica-priority（副本优先级）**\n   - 优先级为 0 的 replica **永远不会被提升为 master**\n   - 数值越小优先级越高\n\n3. **复制偏移量（replication offset）**\n   - 接收到更多 master 数据的 replica 优先\n\n4. **Run ID**\n   - 字典序更小的 Run ID 优先（用于确定性选择）\n\n### 排查步骤\n\n1. **检查所有 replica 的状态**\n   ```bash\n   redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL replicas mymaster\n   ```\n   查看每个 replica 的：\n   - `flags`（是否包含 `s_down`）\n   - `master-link-down-time`（与 master 断连时长）\n   - `replica-priority`（是否为 0）\n\n2. **检查 replica-priority 配置**\n   ```bash\n   redis-cli -p 6380 CONFIG GET replica-priority\n   ```\n   如果所有 replica 的 `replica-priority` 都设置为 0，failover 会失败\n\n3. **检查复制延迟**\n   ```bash\n   redis-cli -p 6380 INFO replication\n   ```\n   查看 `master_link_status` 和 `master_last_io_seconds_ago`\n\n4. **检查 Sentinel 配置**\n   ```bash\n   redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL master mymaster\n   ```\n   确认 `down-after-milliseconds` 设置是否合理（默认 60000ms）\n\n### 常见原因\n\n- 所有 replica 的 `replica-priority` 都设置为 0\n- 所有 replica 与 master 断连时间过长（超过阈值）\n- 所有 replica 都处于 SDOWN 状态\n- 网络分区导致 Sentinel 无法连接到任何 replica\n\n### 解决方案\n\n1. 至少保留一个 replica 的 `replica-priority > 0`\n2. 缩短 `down-after-milliseconds` 或修复 replica 与 master 的连接\n3. 检查网络连通性，确保 Sentinel 能访问 replica\n4. 查看 Sentinel 日志中的 `+sdown` 事件，确认哪些 replica 被标记为下线\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Pub/Sub messages (line 766) + Replica selection and priority (lines 1000-1043)]", "tools_used": ["Read", "Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md"], "contexts_count": 4, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "failover", "replica"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Read", "Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "68bf1e66-5cbc-453a-8f1b-76d43b595c32", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "b3483a51-b381-4f65-950e-73646a30ba68", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来帮你检索这个 Redis Sentinel 故障排查问题。让我并行搜索本地文档和 Qdrant 索引。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_EAQeATXWPIva79oFQZXV7A', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'failover-abort-no-good-slave'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_tW36kxPrdA71F0660cDiyb', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Sentinel failover-abort-no-good-slave 故障排查', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_EAQeATXWPIva79oFQZXV7A', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_tW36kxPrdA71F0660cDiyb', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5261,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel as a distributed system\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel provides high availability for Redis when not using [Redis Cluster](). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel also provides other collateral tasks such as monitoring,\\\\\\\\nnotifications and acts as a configuration provider for clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the full list of Sentinel capabilities at a macroscopic level (i.e. the *big picture*):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Monitoring**.

There is no\\\\\\\\nneed to specify replicas, which are auto-discovered. Sentinel will update the\\\\\\\\nconfiguration automatically with additional information about replicas (in\\\\\\\\norder to retain the information in case of restart).

In order to actually perform a failover, one of the Sentinels need to be elected leader for the failover and be authorized to proceed.

Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\n    28→* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\n    29→* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\n    30→\\n    31→## Sentinel as a distributed system\\n    32→\\n    33→Redis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\n    34→\\n    35→Sentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\n    36→\\n    37→1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\n    38→2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\n    39→\\n    40→The sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\n    41→connecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\n    42→specific properties. In this document concepts will be introduced gradually\\n    43→starting from basic information needed in order to understand the basic\\n    44→properties of Sentinel, to more complex information (that are optional) in\\n    45→order to understand how exactly Sentinel works.\\n    46→\\n    47→## Sentinel quick start\\n    48→\\n    49→### Obtaining Sentinel\\n    50→\\n    51→The current version of Sentinel is called **Sentinel 2**. It is a rewrite of\\n    52→the initial Sentinel implementation using stronger and simpler-to-predict\\n    53→algorithms (that are explained in this documentation).\\n    54→\\n    55→A stable release of Redis Sentinel is shipped since Redis 2.8.\\n    56→\\n    57→New developments are performed in the *unstable* branch, and new features\\n    58→sometimes are back ported into the latest stable branch as soon as they are\\n    59→considered to be stable.\\n    60→\\n    61→Redis Sentinel version 1, shipped with Redis 2.6, is deprecated and should not be used.\\n    62→\\n    63→### Running Sentinel\\n    64→\\n    65→If you are using the `redis-sentinel` executable (or if you have a symbolic\\n    66→link with that name to the `redis-server` executable) you can run Sentinel\\n    67→with the following command line:\\n    68→\\n    69→    redis-sentinel /path/to/sentinel.conf\\n    70→\\n    71→Otherwise you can use directly the `redis-server` executable starting it in\\n    72→Sentinel mode:\\n    73→\\n    74→    redis-server /path/to/sentinel.conf --sentinel\\n    75→\\n    76→Both ways work the same.\\n    77→\\n    78→However **it is mandatory** to use a configuration file when running Sentinel, as this file will be used by the system in order to save the current state that will be reloaded in case of restarts. Sentinel will simply refuse to start if no configuration file is given or if the configuration file path is not writable.\\n    79→\\n    80→Sentinels by default run **listening for connections to TCP port 26379**, so\\n    81→for Sentinels to work, port 26379 of your servers **must be open** to receive\\n    82→connections from the IP addresses of the other Sentinel instances.\\n    83→Otherwise Sentinels can\\'t talk and can\\'t agree about what to do, so failover\\n    84→will never be performed.\\n    85→\\n    86→### Fundamental things to know about Sentinel before deploying\\n    87→\\n    88→1. You need at least three Sentinel instances for a robust deployment.\\n    89→2. The three Sentinel instances should be placed into computers or virtual machines that are believed to fail in an independent way. So for example different physical servers or Virtual Machines executed on different availability zones.\\n    90→3. Sentinel + Redis distributed system does not guarantee that acknowledged writes are retained during failures, since Redis uses asynchronous replication. However there are ways to deploy Sentinel that make the window to lose writes limited to certain moments, while there are other less secure ways to deploy it.\\n    91→4. You need Sentinel support in your clients. Popular client libraries have Sentinel support, but not all.\\n    92→5. There is no HA setup which is safe if you don\\'t test from time to time in development environments, or even better if you can, in production environments, if they work. You may have a misconfiguration that will become apparent only when it\\'s too late (at 3am when your master stops working).\\n    93→6. **Sentinel, Docker, or other forms of Network Address Translation or Port Mapping should be mixed with care**: Docker performs port remapping, breaking Sentinel auto discovery of other Sentinel processes and the list of replicas for a master. Check the [section about _Sentinel and Docker_](#sentinel-docker-nat-and-possible-issues) later in this document for more information.\\n    94→\\n    95→### Configuring Sentinel\\n    96→\\n    97→The Redis source distribution contains a file called `sentinel.conf`\\n    98→that is a self-documented example configuration file you can use to\\n    99→configure Sentinel, however a typical minimal configuration file looks like the\\n   100→following:\\n   101→\\n   102→    sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2\\n   103→    sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 60000\\n   104→    sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000\\n   105→    sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1\\n   106→\\n   107→    sentinel monitor resque 192.168.1.3 6380 4\\n   108→    sentinel down-after-milliseconds resque 10000\\n   109→    sentinel failover-timeout resque 180000\\n   110→    sentinel parallel-syncs resque 5\\n   111→\\n   112→You only need to specify the masters to monitor, giving to each separated\\n   113→master (that may have any number of replicas) a different name. There is no\\n   114→need to specify replicas, which are auto-discovered. Sentinel will update the\\n   115→configuration automatically with additional information about replicas (in\\n   116→order to retain the information in case of restart). The configuration is\\n   117→also rewritten every time a replica is promoted to master during a failover\\n   118→and every time a new Sentinel is discovered.\\n   119→\\n   120→The example configuration above basically monitors two sets of Redis\\n   121→instances, each composed of a master and an undefined number of replicas.\\n   122→One set of instances is called `mymaster`, and the other `resque`.\\n   123→\\n   124→The meaning of the arguments of `sentinel monitor` statements is the following:\\n   125→\\n   126→    sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <port> <quorum>\\n   127→\\n   128→For the sake of clarity, let\\'s check line by line what the configuration\\n   129→options mean:\\n   130→\\n   131→The first line is used to tell Redis to monitor a master called *mymaster*,\\n   132→that is at address 127.0.0.1 and port 6379, with a quorum of 2. Everything\\n   133→is pretty obvious but the **quorum** argument:\\n   134→\\n   135→* The **quorum** is the number of Sentinels that need to agree about the fact the master is not reachable, in order to really mark the master as failing, and eventually start a failover procedure if possible.\\n   136→* However **the quorum is only used to detect the failure**. In order to actually perform a failover, one of the Sentinels need to be elected leader for the failover and be authorized to proceed. This only happens with the vote of the **majority of the Sentinel processes**.\\n   137→\\n   138→So for example if you have 5 Sentinel processes, and the quorum for a given\\n   139→master set to the value of 2, this is what happens:\\n   140→\\n   141→* If two Sentinels agree at the same time about the master being unreachable, one of the two will try to start a failover.\\n   142→* If there are at least a total of three Sentinels reachable, the failover will be authorized and will actually start.\\n   143→\\n   144→In practical terms this means during failures **Sentinel never starts a failover if the majority of Sentinel processes are unable to talk** (aka no failover in the minority partition).\\n   145→\\n   146→### Other Sentinel options\\n   147→\\n   148→The other options are almost always in the form:\\n   149→\\n   150→    sentinel <option_name> <master_name> <option_value>\\n   151→\\n   152→And are used for the following purposes:\\n   153→\\n   154→* `down-after-milliseconds` is the time in milliseconds an instance should not\\n   155→be reachable (either does not reply to our PINGs or it is replying with an\\n   156→error) for a Sentinel starting to think it is down.\\n   157→* `parallel-syncs` sets the number of replicas that can be reconfigured to use\\n   158→the new master after a failover at the same time. The lower the number, the\\n   159→more time it will take for the failover process to complete, however if the\\n   160→replicas are configured to serve old data, you may not want all the replicas to\\n   161→re-synchronize with the master at the same time. While the replication\\n   162→process is mostly non blocking for a replica, there is a moment when it stops to\\n   163→load the bulk data from the master. You may want to make sure only one replica\\n   164→at a time is not reachable by setting this option to the value of 1.\\n   165→\\n   166→Additional options are described in the rest of this document and\\n   167→documented in the example `sentinel.conf` file shipped with the Redis\\n   168→distribution.\\n   169→\\n   170→Configuration parameters can be modified at runtime:\\n   171→\\n   172→* Master-specific configuration parameters are modified using `SENTINEL SET`.\\n   173→* Global configuration parameters are modified using `SENTINEL CONFIG SET`.\\n   174→\\n   175→See the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\n   176→\\n   177→### Example Sentinel deployments\\n   178→\\n   179→Now that you know the basic information about Sentinel, you may wonder where\\n   180→you should place your Sentinel processes, how many Sentinel processes you need\\n   181→and so forth. This section shows a few example deployments.\\n   182→\\n   183→We use ASCII art in order to show you configuration examples in a *graphical*\\n   184→format, this is what the different symbols means:\\n   185→\\n   186→    +--------------------+\\n   187→    | This is a computer |\\n   188→    | or VM that fails   |\\n   189→    | independently.

However in\\n   276→the above setup there is a higher risk due to clients being partitioned away\\n   277→with an old master, like in the following picture:\\n   278→\\n   279→             +----+\\n   280→             | M1 |\\n   281→             | S1 | <- C1 (writes will be lost)\\n   282→             +----+\\n   283→                |\\n   284→                /\\n   285→                /\\n   286→    +------+    |    +----+\\n   287→    | [M2] |----+----| R3 |\\n   288→    | S2   |         | S3 |\\n   289→    +------+         +----+\\n   290→\\n   291→In this case a network partition isolated the old master M1, so the\\n   292→replica R2 is promoted to master. However clients, like C1, that are\\n   293→in the same partition as the old master, may continue to write data\\n   294→to the old master. This data will be lost forever since when the partition\\n   295→will heal, the master will be reconfigured as a replica of the new master,\\n   296→discarding its data set.\\n   297→\\n   298→This problem can be mitigated using the following Redis replication\\n   299→feature, that allows to stop accepting writes if a master detects that\\n   300→it is no longer able to transfer its writes to the specified number of replicas.\\n   301→\\n   302→    min-replicas-to-write 1\\n   303→    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\n   304→\\n   305→With the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\n   306→\\n   307→Using this configuration, the old Redis master M1 in the above example, will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel configuration will converge to the new one, the client C1 will be able to fetch a valid configuration and will continue with the new master.\\n   308→\\n   309→However there is no free lunch. With this refinement, if the two replicas are\\n   310→down, the master will stop accepting writes. It\\'s a trade off.\\n   311→\\n   312→#### Example 3: Sentinel in the client boxes\\n   313→\\n   314→Sometimes we have only two Redis boxes available, one for the master and\\n   315→one for the replica. The configuration in the example 2 is not viable in\\n   316→that case, so we can resort to the following, where Sentinels are placed\\n   317→where clients are:\\n   318→\\n   319→                +----+         +----+\\n   320→                | M1 |----+----| R1 |\\n   321→                |    |    |    |    |\\n   322→                +----+    |    +----+\\n   323→                          |\\n   324→             +------------+------------+\\n   325→             |            |            |\\n   326→             |            |            |\\n   327→          +----+        +----+      +----+\\n   328→          | C1 |        | C2 |      | C3 |\\n   329→          | S1 |        | S2 |      | S3 |\\n   330→          +----+        +----+      +----+\\n   331→\\n   332→          Configuration: quorum = 2\\n   333→\\n   334→In this setup, the point of view Sentinels is the same as the clients: if\\n   335→a master is reachable by the majority of the clients, it is fine.\\n   336→C1, C2, C3 here are generic clients, it does not mean that C1 identifies\\n   337→a single client connected to Redis. It is more likely something like\\n   338→an application server, a Rails app, or something like that.\\n   339→\\n   340→If the box where M1 and S1 are running fails, the failover will happen\\n   341→without issues, however it is easy to see that different network partitions\\n   342→will result in different behaviors. For example Sentinel will not be able\\n   343→to setup if the network between the clients and the Redis servers is\\n   344→disconnected, since the Redis master and replica will both be unavailable.\\n   345→\\n   346→Note that if C3 gets partitioned with M1 (hardly possible with\\n   347→the network described above, but more likely possible with different\\n   348→layouts, or because of failures at the software layer), we have a similar\\n   349→issue as described in Example 2, with the difference that here we have\\n   350→no way to break the symmetry, since there is just a replica and master, so\\n   351→the master can\\'t stop accepting queries when it is disconnected from its replica,\\n   352→otherwise the master would never be available during replica failures.\\n   353→\\n   354→So this is a valid setup but the setup in the Example 2 has advantages\\n   355→such as the HA system of Redis running in the same boxes as Redis itself\\n   356→which may be simpler to manage, and the ability to put a bound on the amount\\n   357→of time a master in the minority partition can receive writes.\\n   358→\\n   359→#### Example 4: Sentinel client side with less than three clients\\n   360→\\n   361→The setup described in the Example 3 cannot be used if there are less than\\n   362→three boxes in the client side (for example three web servers). In this\\n   363→case we need to resort to a mixed setup like the following:\\n   364→\\n   365→                +----+         +----+\\n   366→                | M1 |----+----| R1 |\\n   367→                | S1 |    |    | S2 |\\n   368→                +----+    |    +----+\\n   369→                          |\\n   370→                   +------+-----+\\n   371→                   |            |\\n   372→                   |            |\\n   373→                +----+        +----+\\n   374→                | C1 |        | C2 |\\n   375→                | S3 |        | S4 |\\n   376→                +----+        +----+\\n   377→\\n   378→          Configuration: quorum = 3\\n   379→\\n   380→This is similar to the setup in Example 3, but here we run four Sentinels\\n   381→in the four boxes we have available. If the master M1 becomes unavailable\\n   382→the other three Sentinels will perform the failover.\\n   383→\\n   384→In theory this setup works removing the box where C2 and S4 are running, and\\n   385→setting the quorum to 2. However it is unlikely that we want HA in the\\n   386→Redis side without having high availability in our application layer.\\n   387→\\n   388→### Sentinel, Docker, NAT, and possible issues\\n   389→\\n   390→Docker uses a technique called port mapping: programs running inside Docker\\n   391→containers may be exposed with a different port compared to the one the\\n   392→program believes to be using. This is useful in order to run multiple\\n   393→containers using the same ports, at the same time, in the same server.\\n   394→\\n   395→Docker is not the only software system where this happens, there are other\\n   396→Network Address Translation setups where ports may be remapped, and sometimes\\n   397→not ports but also IP addresses.\\n   398→\\n   399→Remapping ports and addresses creates issues with Sentinel in two ways:\\n   400→\\n   401→1. Sentinel auto-discovery of other Sentinels no longer works, since it is based on *hello* messages where each Sentinel announce at which port and IP address they are listening for connection. However Sentinels have no way to understand that an address or port is remapped, so it is announcing an information that is not correct for other Sentinels to connect.\\n   402→2. Replicas are listed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) output of a Redis master in a similar way: the address is detected by the master checking the remote peer of the TCP connection, while the port is advertised by the replica itself during the handshake, however the port may be wrong for the same reason as exposed in point 1.\\n   403→\\n   404→Since Sentinels auto detect replicas using masters [`INFO`](/commands/info) output information,\\n   405→the detected replicas will not be reachable, and Sentinel will never be able to\\n   406→failover the master, since there are no good replicas from the point of view of\\n   407→the system, so there is currently no way to monitor with Sentinel a set of\\n   408→master and replica instances deployed with Docker, **unless you instruct Docker\\n   409→to map the port 1:1**.\\n   410→\\n   411→For the first problem, in case you want to run a set of Sentinel\\n   412→instances using Docker with forwarded ports (or any other NAT setup where ports\\n   413→are remapped), you can use the following two Sentinel configuration directives\\n   414→in order to force Sentinel to announce a specific set of IP and port:\\n   415→\\n   416→    sentinel announce-ip <ip>\\n   417→    sentinel announce-port <port>\\n   418→\\n   419→Note that Docker has the ability to run in *host networking mode* (check the `--net=host` option for more information). This should create no issues since ports are not remapped in this setup.\\n   420→\\n   421→### IP Addresses and DNS names\\n   422→\\n   423→Older versions of Sentinel did not support host names and required IP addresses to be specified everywhere.\\n   424→Starting with version 6.2, Sentinel has *optional* support for host names.\\n   425→\\n   426→**This capability is disabled by default. If you\\'re going to enable DNS/hostnames support, please note:**\\n   427→\\n   428→1. The name resolution configuration on your Redis and Sentinel nodes must be reliable and be able to resolve addresses quickly. Unexpected delays in address resolution may have a negative impact on Sentinel.\\n   429→2. You should use hostnames everywhere and avoid mixing hostnames and IP addresses. To do that, use `replica-announce-ip <hostname>` and `sentinel announce-ip <hostname>` for all Redis and Sentinel instances, respectively.\\n   430→\\n   431→Enabling the `resolve-hostnames` global configuration allows Sentinel to accept host names:\\n   432→\\n   433→* As part of a `sentinel monitor` command\\n   434→* As a replica address, if the replica uses a host name value for `replica-announce-ip`\\n   435→\\n   436→Sentinel will accept host names as valid inputs and resolve them, but will still refer to IP addresses when announcing an instance, updating configuration files, etc.\\n   437→\\n   438→Enabling the `announce-hostnames` global configuration makes Sentinel use host names instead. This affects replies to clients, values written in configuration files, the [`REPLICAOF`](/commands/replicaof) command issued to replicas, etc.\\n   439→\\n   440→This behavior may not be compatible with all Sentinel clients, that may explicitly expect an IP address.\\n   441→\\n   442→Using host names may be useful when clients use TLS to connect to instances and require a name rather than an IP address in order to perform certificate ASN matching.\\n   443→\\n   444→## A quick tutorial\\n   445→\\n   446→In the next sections of this document, all the details about [_Sentinel API_](#sentinel-api),\\n   447→configuration and semantics will be covered incrementally. However for people\\n   448→that want to play with the system ASAP, this section is a tutorial that shows\\n   449→how to configure and interact with 3 Sentinel instances.\\n   450→\\n   451→Here we assume that the instances are executed at port 5000, 5001, 5002.\\n   452→We also assume that you have a running Redis master at port 6379 with a\\n   453→replica running at port 6380. We will use the IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1\\n   454→everywhere during the tutorial, assuming you are running the simulation\\n   455→on your personal computer.\\n   456→\\n   457→The three Sentinel configuration files should look like the following:\\n   458→\\n   459→    port 5000\\n   460→    sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2\\n   461→    sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 5000\\n   462→    sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 60000\\n   463→    sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1\\n   464→\\n   465→The other two configuration files will be identical but using 5001 and 5002\\n   466→as port numbers.\\n   467→\\n   468→A few things to note about the above configuration:\\n   469→\\n   470→* The master set is called `mymaster`. It identifies the master and its replicas. Since each *master set* has a different name, Sentinel can monitor different sets of masters and replicas at the same time.\\n   471→* The quorum was set to the value of 2 (last argument of `sentinel monitor` configuration directive).\\n   472→* The `down-after-milliseconds` value is 5000 milliseconds, that is 5 seconds, so masters will be detected as failing as soon as we don\\'t receive any reply from our pings within this amount of time.\\n   473→\\n   474→Once you start the three Sentinels, you\\'ll see a few messages they log, like:\\n   475→\\n   476→    +monitor master mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 quorum 2\\n   477→\\n   478→This is a Sentinel event, and you can receive this kind of events via Pub/Sub\\n   479→if you [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe) to the event name as specified later in [_Pub/Sub Messages_ section](#pubsub-messages).\\n   480→\\n   481→Sentinel generates and logs different events during failure detection and\\n   482→failover.\\n   483→\\n   484→Asking Sentinel about the state of a master\\n   485→---\\n   486→\\n   487→The most obvious thing to do with Sentinel to get started, is check if the\\n   488→master it is monitoring is doing well:\\n   489→\\n   490→    $ redis-cli -p 5000\\n   491→    127.0.0.1:5000> sentinel master mymaster\\n   492→     1) \"name\"\\n   493→     2) \"mymaster\"\\n   494→     3) \"ip\"\\n   495→     4) \"127.0.0.1\"\\n   496→     5) \"port\"\\n   497→     6) \"6379\"\\n   498→     7) \"runid\"\\n   499→     8) \"953ae6a589449c13ddefaee3538d356d287f509b\"\\n   500→     9) \"flags\"\\n   501→    10) \"master\"\\n   502→    11) \"link-pending-commands\"\\n   503→    12) \"0\"\\n   504→    13) \"link-refcount\"\\n   505→    14) \"1\"\\n   506→    15) \"last-ping-sent\"\\n   507→    16) \"0\"\\n   508→    17) \"last-ok-ping-reply\"\\n   509→    18) \"735\"\\n   510→    19) \"last-ping-reply\"\\n   511→    20) \"735\"\\n   512→    21) \"down-after-milliseconds\"\\n   513→    22) \"5000\"\\n   514→    23) \"info-refresh\"\\n   515→    24) \"126\"\\n   516→    25) \"role-reported\"\\n   517→    26) \"master\"\\n   518→    27) \"role-reported-time\"\\n   519→    28) \"532439\"\\n   520→    29) \"config-epoch\"\\n   521→    30) \"1\"\\n   522→    31) \"num-slaves\"\\n   523→    32) \"1\"\\n   524→    33) \"num-other-sentinels\"\\n   525→    34) \"2\"\\n   526→    35) \"quorum\"\\n   527→    36) \"2\"\\n   528→    37) \"failover-timeout\"\\n   529→    38) \"60000\"\\n   530→    39) \"parallel-syncs\"\\n   531→    40) \"1\"\\n   532→\\n   533→As you can see, it prints a number of information about the master. There are\\n   534→a few that are of particular interest for us:\\n   535→\\n   536→1. `num-other-sentinels` is 2, so we know the Sentinel already detected two more Sentinels for this master. If you check the logs you\\'ll see the `+sentinel` events generated.\\n   537→2. `flags` is just `master`. If the master was down we could expect to see `s_down` or `o_down` flag as well here.\\n   538→3. `num-slaves` is correctly set to 1, so Sentinel also detected that there is an attached replica to our master.\\n   539→\\n   540→In order to explore more about this instance, you may want to try the following\\n   541→two commands:\\n   542→\\n   543→    SENTINEL replicas mymaster\\n   544→    SENTINEL sentinels mymaster\\n   545→\\n   546→The first will provide similar information about the replicas connected to the\\n   547→master, and the second about the other Sentinels.\\n   548→\\n   549→Obtaining the address of the current master\\n   550→---\\n   551→\\n   552→As we already specified, Sentinel also acts as a configuration provider for\\n   553→clients that want to connect to a set of master and replicas. Because of\\n   554→possible failovers or reconfigurations, clients have no idea about who is\\n   555→the currently active master for a given set of instances, so Sentinel exports\\n   556→an API to ask this question:\\n   557→\\n   558→    127.0.0.1:5000> SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n   559→    1) \"127.0.0.1\"\\n   560→    2) \"6379\"\\n   561→\\n   562→### Testing the failover\\n   563→\\n   564→At this point our toy Sentinel deployment is ready to be tested. We can\\n   565→just kill our master and check if the configuration changes. To do so\\n   566→we can just do:\\n   567→\\n   568→    redis-cli -p 6379 DEBUG sleep 30\\n   569→\\n   570→This command will make our master no longer reachable, sleeping for 30 seconds.\\n   571→It basically simulates a master hanging for some reason.\\n   572→\\n   573→If you check the Sentinel logs, you should be able to see a lot of action:\\n   574→\\n   575→1. Each Sentinel detects the master is down with an `+sdown` event.\\n   576→2. This event is later escalated to `+odown`, which means that multiple Sentinels agree about the fact the master is not reachable.\\n   577→3. Sentinels vote a Sentinel that will start the first failover attempt.\\n   578→4. The failover happens.\\n   579→\\n   580→If you ask again what is the current master address for `mymaster`, eventually\\n   581→we should get a different reply this time:\\n   582→\\n   583→    127.0.0.1:5000> SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n   584→    1) \"127.0.0.1\"\\n   585→    2) \"6380\"\\n   586→\\n   587→So far so good... At this point you may jump to create your Sentinel deployment\\n   588→or can read more to understand all the Sentinel commands and internals.\\n   589→\\n   590→## Sentinel API\\n   591→\\n   592→Sentinel provides an API in order to inspect its state, check the health\\n   593→of monitored masters and replicas, subscribe in order to receive specific\\n   594→notifications, and change the Sentinel configuration at run time.\\n   595→\\n   596→By default Sentinel runs using TCP port 26379 (note that 6379 is the normal\\n   597→Redis port). Sentinels accept commands using the Redis protocol, so you can\\n   598→use `redis-cli` or any other unmodified Redis client in order to talk with\\n   599→Sentinel.\\n   600→\\n   601→It is possible to directly query a Sentinel to check what is the state of\\n   602→the monitored Redis instances from its point of view, to see what other\\n   603→Sentinels it knows, and so forth. Alternatively, using Pub/Sub, it is possible\\n   604→to receive *push style* notifications from Sentinels, every time some event\\n   605→happens, like a failover, or an instance entering an error condition, and\\n   606→so forth.\\n   607→\\n   608→### Sentinel commands\\n   609→\\n   610→The `SENTINEL` command is the main API for Sentinel. The following is the list of its subcommands (minimal version is noted for where applicable):\\n   611→\\n   612→* **SENTINEL CONFIG GET `<name>`** (`>= 6.2`) Get the current value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter. The specified name may be a wildcard, similar to the Redis [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) command.\\n   613→* **SENTINEL CONFIG SET `<name>` `<value>`** (`>= 6.2`) Set the value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter.\\n   614→* **SENTINEL CKQUORUM `<master name>`** Check if the current Sentinel configuration is able to reach the quorum needed to failover a master, and the majority needed to authorize the failover. This command should be used in monitoring systems to check if a Sentinel deployment is ok.\\n   615→* **SENTINEL FLUSHCONFIG** Force Sentinel to rewrite its configuration on disk, including the current Sentinel state. Normally Sentinel rewrites the configuration every time something changes in its state (in the context of the subset of the state which is persisted on disk across restart). However sometimes it is possible that the configuration file is lost because of operation errors, disk failures, package upgrade scripts or configuration managers. In those cases a way to force Sentinel to rewrite the configuration file is handy. This command works even if the previous configuration file is completely missing.\\n   616→* **SENTINEL FAILOVER `<master name>`** Force a failover as if the master was not reachable, and without asking for agreement to other Sentinels (however a new version of the configuration will be published so that the other Sentinels will update their configurations).\\n   617→* **SENTINEL GET-MASTER-ADDR-BY-NAME `<master name>`** Return the ip and port number of the master with that name. If a failover is in progress or terminated successfully for this master it returns the address and port of the promoted replica.\\n   618→* **SENTINEL INFO-CACHE** (`>= 3.2`) Return cached [`INFO`](/commands/info) output from masters and replicas.\\n   619→* **SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR <ip> <port> <current-epoch> <runid>** Check if the master specified by ip:port is down from current Sentinel\\'s point of view. This command is mostly for internal use.\\n   620→* **SENTINEL MASTER `<master name>`** Show the state and info of the specified master.\\n   621→* **SENTINEL MASTERS** Show a list of monitored masters and their state.\\n   622→* **SENTINEL MONITOR** Start Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\n   623→* **SENTINEL MYID** (`>= 6.2`) Return the ID of the Sentinel instance.\\n   624→* **SENTINEL PENDING-SCRIPTS** This command returns information about pending scripts.\\n   625→* **SENTINEL REMOVE** Stop Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\n   626→* **SENTINEL REPLICAS `<master name>`** (`>= 5.0`) Show a list of replicas for this master, and their state.\\n   627→* **SENTINEL SENTINELS `<master name>`** Show a list of sentinel instances for this master, and their state.\\n   628→* **SENTINEL SET** Set Sentinel\\'s monitoring configuration. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\n   629→* **SENTINEL SIMULATE-FAILURE (crash-after-election|crash-after-promotion|help)** (`>= 3.2`) This command simulates different Sentinel crash scenarios.\\n   630→* **SENTINEL RESET `<pattern>`** This command will reset all the masters with matching name. The pattern argument is a glob-style pattern. The reset process clears any previous state in a master (including a failover in progress), and removes every replica and sentinel already discovered and associated with the master.\\n   631→\\n   632→For connection management and administration purposes, Sentinel supports the following subset of Redis\\' commands:\\n   633→\\n   634→* **ACL** (`>= 6.2`) This command manages the Sentinel Access Control List. For more information refer to the [ACL]({{< relref \"/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl\" >}}) documentation page and the [_Sentinel Access Control List authentication_](#sentinel-access-control-list-authentication).\\n   635→* **AUTH** (`>= 5.0.1`) Authenticate a client connection. For more information refer to the [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command and the [_Configuring Sentinel instances with authentication_ section](#configuring-sentinel-instances-with-authentication).\\n   636→* **CLIENT** This command manages client connections. For more information refer to its subcommands\\' pages.\\n   637→* **COMMAND** (`>= 6.2`) This command returns information about commands. For more information refer to the [`COMMAND`](/commands/command) command and its various subcommands.\\n   638→* **HELLO** (`>= 6.0`) Switch the connection\\'s protocol. For more information refer to the [`HELLO`](/commands/hello) command.\\n   639→* **INFO** Return information and statistics about the Sentinel server. For more information see the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command.\\n   640→* **PING** This command simply returns PONG.\\n   641→* **ROLE** This command returns the string \"sentinel\" and a list of monitored masters. For more information refer to the [`ROLE`](/commands/role) command.\\n   642→* **SHUTDOWN** Shut down the Sentinel instance.\\n   643→\\n   644→Lastly, Sentinel also supports the [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe), [`UNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/unsubscribe), [`PSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/psubscribe) and [`PUNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/punsubscribe) commands. Refer to the [_Pub/Sub Messages_ section](#pubsub-messages) for more details.\\n   645→\\n   646→### Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime\\n   647→\\n   648→Starting with Redis version 2.8.4, Sentinel provides an API in order to add, remove, or change the configuration of a given master. Note that if you have multiple sentinels you should apply the changes to all to your instances for Redis Sentinel to work properly. This means that changing the configuration of a single Sentinel does not automatically propagate the changes to the other Sentinels in the network.\\n   649→\\n   650→The following is a list of `SENTINEL` subcommands used in order to update the configuration of a Sentinel instance.\\n   651→\\n   652→* **SENTINEL MONITOR `<name>` `<ip>` `<port>` `<quorum>`** This command tells the Sentinel to start monitoring a new master with the specified name, ip, port, and quorum. It is identical to the `sentinel monitor` configuration directive in `sentinel.conf` configuration file, with the difference that you can\\'t use a hostname in as `ip`, but you need to provide an IPv4 or IPv6 address.\\n   653→* **SENTINEL REMOVE `<name>`** is used in order to remove the specified master: the master will no longer be monitored, and will totally be removed from the internal state of the Sentinel, so it will no longer listed by `SENTINEL masters` and so forth.\\n   654→* **SENTINEL SET `<name>` [`<option>` `<value>` ...]** The SET command is very similar to the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command of Redis, and is used in order to change configuration parameters of a specific master. Multiple option / value pairs can be specified (or none at all). All the configuration parameters that can be configured via `sentinel.conf` are also configurable using the SET command.\\n   655→\\n   656→The following is an example of `SENTINEL SET` command in order to modify the `down-after-milliseconds` configuration of a master called `objects-cache`:\\n   657→\\n   658→    SENTINEL SET objects-cache-master down-after-milliseconds 1000\\n   659→\\n   660→As already stated, `SENTINEL SET` can be used to set all the configuration parameters that are settable in the startup configuration file. Moreover it is possible to change just the master quorum configuration without removing and re-adding the master with `SENTINEL REMOVE` followed by `SENTINEL MONITOR`, but simply using:\\n   661→\\n   662→    SENTINEL SET objects-cache-master quorum 5\\n   663→\\n   664→Note that there is no equivalent GET command since `SENTINEL MASTER` provides all the configuration parameters in a simple to parse format (as a field/value pairs array).\\n   665→\\n   666→Starting with Redis version 6.2, Sentinel also allows getting and setting global configuration parameters which were only supported in the configuration file prior to that.\\n   667→\\n   668→* **SENTINEL CONFIG GET `<name>`** Get the current value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter. The specified name may be a wildcard, similar to the Redis [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) command.\\n   669→* **SENTINEL CONFIG SET `<name>` `<value>`** Set the value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter.\\n   670→\\n   671→Global parameters that can be manipulated include:\\n   672→\\n   673→* `resolve-hostnames`, `announce-hostnames`. See [_IP addresses and DNS names_](#ip-addresses-and-dns-names).\\n   674→* `announce-ip`, `announce-port`. See [_Sentinel, Docker, NAT, and possible issues_](#sentinel-docker-nat-and-possible-issues).\\n   675→* `sentinel-user`, `sentinel-pass`. See [_Configuring Sentinel instances with authentication_](#configuring-sentinel-instances-with-authentication).\\n   676→\\n   677→### Adding or removing Sentinels\\n   678→\\n   679→Adding a new Sentinel to your deployment is a simple process because of the\\n   680→auto-discover mechanism implemented by Sentinel. All you need to do is to\\n   681→start the new Sentinel configured to monitor the currently active master.\\n   682→Within 10 seconds the Sentinel will acquire the list of other Sentinels and\\n   683→the set of replicas attached to the master.\\n   684→\\n   685→If you need to add multiple Sentinels at once, it is suggested to add it\\n   686→one after the other, waiting for all the other Sentinels to already know\\n   687→about the first one before adding the next. This is useful in order to still\\n   688→guarantee that majority can be achieved only in one side of a partition,\\n   689→in the chance failures should happen in the process of adding new Sentinels.\\n   690→\\n   691→This can be easily achieved by adding every new Sentinel with a 30 seconds delay, and during absence of network partitions.\\n   692→\\n   693→At the end of the process it is possible to use the command\\n   694→`SENTINEL MASTER mastername` in order to check if all the Sentinels agree about\\n   695→the total number of Sentinels monitoring the master.\\n   696→\\n   697→Removing a Sentinel is a bit more complex: **Sentinels never forget already seen\\n   698→Sentinels**, even if they are not reachable for a long time, since we don\\'t\\n   699→want to dynamically change the majority needed to authorize a failover and\\n   700→the creation of a new configuration number. So in order to remove a Sentinel\\n   701→the following steps should be performed in absence of network partitions:\\n   702→\\n   703→1. Stop the Sentinel process of the Sentinel you want to remove.\\n   704→2. Send a `SENTINEL RESET *` command to all the other Sentinel instances (instead of `*` you can use the exact master name if you want to reset just a single master). One after the other, waiting at least 30 seconds between instances.\\n   705→3. Check that all the Sentinels agree about the number of Sentinels currently active, by inspecting the output of `SENTINEL MASTER mastername` of every Sentinel.\\n   706→\\n   707→### Removing the old master or unreachable replicas\\n   708→\\n   709→Sentinels never forget about replicas of a given master, even when they are\\n   710→unreachable for a long time. This is useful, because Sentinels should be able\\n   711→to correctly reconfigure a returning replica after a network partition or a\\n   712→failure event.\\n   713→\\n   714→Moreover, after a failover, the failed over master is virtually added as a\\n   715→replica of the new master, this way it will be reconfigured to replicate with\\n   716→the new master as soon as it will be available again.\\n   717→\\n   718→However sometimes you want to remove a replica (that may be the old master)\\n   719→forever from the list of replicas monitored by Sentinels.\\n   720→\\n   721→In order to do this, you need to send a `SENTINEL RESET mastername` command\\n   722→to all the Sentinels: they\\'ll refresh the list of replicas within the next\\n   723→10 seconds, only adding the ones listed as correctly replicating from the\\n   724→current master [`INFO`](/commands/info) output.\\n   725→\\n   726→### Pub/Sub messages\\n   727→\\n   728→A client can use a Sentinel as a Redis-compatible Pub/Sub server\\n   729→(but you can\\'t use [`PUBLISH`](/commands/publish)) in order to [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe) or [`PSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/psubscribe) to\\n   730→channels and get notified about specific events.\\n   731→\\n   732→The channel name is the same as the name of the event. For instance the\\n   733→channel named `+sdown` will receive all the notifications related to instances\\n   734→entering an `SDOWN` (SDOWN means the instance is no longer reachable from\\n   735→the point of view of the Sentinel you are querying) condition.\\n   736→\\n   737→To get all the messages simply subscribe using `PSUBSCRIBE *`.\\n   738→\\n   739→The following is a list of channels and message formats you can receive using\\n   740→this API.

Disconnection time from the master.\\n  1009→2. Replica priority.\\n  1010→3. Replication offset processed.\\n  1011→4.

The replicas are sorted by `replica-priority` as configured in the `redis.conf` file of the Redis instance. A lower priority will be preferred.\\n  1030→2. If the priority is the same, the replication offset processed by the replica is checked, and the replica that received more data from the master is selected.\\n  1031→3. If multiple replicas have the same priority and processed the same data from the master, a further check is performed, selecting the replica with the lexicographically smaller run ID. Having a lower run ID is not a real advantage for a replica, but is useful in order to make the process of replica selection more deterministic, instead of resorting to select a random replica.\\n  1032→\\n  1033→In most cases, `replica-priority` does not need to be set explicitly so all\\n  1034→instances will use the same default value. If there is a particular fail-over\\n  1035→preference, `replica-priority` must be set on all instances, including masters,\\n  1036→as a master may become a replica at some future point in time - and it will then\\n  1037→need the proper `replica-priority` settings.\\n  1038→\\n  1039→A Redis instance can be configured with a special `replica-priority` of zero\\n  1040→in order to be **never selected** by Sentinels as the new master.\\n  1041→However a replica configured in this way will still be reconfigured by\\n  1042→Sentinels in order to replicate with the new master after a failover, the\\n  1043→only difference is that it will never become a master itself.\\n  1044→\\n  1045→## Algorithms and internals\\n  1046→\\n  1047→In the following sections we will explore the details of Sentinel behavior.\\n  1048→It is not strictly needed for users to be aware of all the details, but a\\n  1049→deep understanding of Sentinel may help to deploy and operate Sentinel in\\n  1050→a more effective way.\\n  1051→\\n  1052→### Quorum\\n  1053→\\n  1054→The previous sections showed that every master monitored by Sentinel is associated to a configured **quorum**. It specifies the number of Sentinel processes\\n  1055→that need to agree about the unreachability or error condition of the master in\\n  1056→order to trigger a failover.\\n  1057→\\n  1058→However, after the failover is triggered, in order for the failover to actually be performed, **at least a majority of Sentinels must authorize the Sentinel to\\n  1059→failover**. Sentinel never performs a failover in the partition where a\\n  1060→minority of Sentinels exist.\\n  1061→\\n  1062→Let\\'s try to make things a bit more clear:\\n  1063→\\n  1064→* Quorum: the number of Sentinel processes that need to detect an error condition in order for a master to be flagged as **ODOWN**.\\n  1065→* The failover is triggered by the **ODOWN** state.\\n  1066→* Once the failover is triggered, the Sentinel trying to failover is required to ask for authorization to a majority of Sentinels (or more than the majority if the quorum is set to a number greater than the majority).\\n  1067→\\n  1068→The difference may seem subtle but is actually quite simple to understand and use.  For example if you have 5 Sentinel instances, and the quorum is set to 2, a failover will be triggered as soon as 2 Sentinels believe that the master is not reachable, however one of the two Sentinels will be able to failover only if it gets authorization at least from 3 Sentinels.\\n  1069→\\n  1070→If instead the quorum is configured to 5, all the Sentinels must agree about the master error condition, and the authorization from all Sentinels is required in order to failover.\\n  1071→\\n  1072→This means that the quorum can be used to tune Sentinel in two ways:\\n  1073→\\n  1074→1. If a quorum is set to a value smaller than the majority of Sentinels we deploy, we are basically making Sentinel more sensitive to master failures, triggering a failover as soon as even just a minority of Sentinels is no longer able to talk with the master.\\n  1075→2. If a quorum is set to a value greater than the majority of Sentinels, we are making Sentinel able to failover only when there are a very large number (larger than majority) of well connected Sentinels which agree about the master being down.\\n  1076→\\n  1077→### Configuration epochs\\n  1078→\\n  1079→Sentinels require to get authorizations from a majority in order to start a\\n  1080→failover for a few important reasons:\\n  1081→\\n  1082→When a Sentinel is authorized, it gets a unique **configuration epoch** for the master it is failing over. This is a number that will be used to version the new configuration after the failover is completed. Because a majority agreed that a given version was assigned to a given Sentinel, no other Sentinel will be able to use it. This means that every configuration of every failover is versioned with a unique version. We\\'ll see why this is so important.\\n  1083→\\n  1084→Moreover Sentinels have a rule: if a Sentinel voted another Sentinel for the failover of a given master, it will wait some time to try to failover the same master again. This delay is the `2 * failover-timeout` you can configure in `sentinel.conf`. This means that Sentinels will not try to failover the same master at the same time, the first to ask to be authorized will try, if it fails another will try after some time, and so forth.\\n  1085→\\n  1086→Redis Sentinel guarantees the *liveness* property that if a majority of Sentinels are able to talk, eventually one will be authorized to failover if the master is down.\\n  1087→\\n  1088→Redis Sentinel also guarantees the *safety* property that every Sentinel will failover the same master using a different *configuration epoch*.\\n  1089→\\n  1090→### Configuration propagation\\n  1091→\\n  1092→Once a Sentinel is able to failover a master successfully, it will start to broadcast the new configuration so that the other Sentinels will update their information about a given master.\\n  1093→\\n  1094→For a failover to be considered successful, it requires that the Sentinel was able to send the `REPLICAOF NO ONE` command to the selected replica, and that the switch to master was later observed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) output of the master.\\n  1095→\\n  1096→At this point, even if the reconfiguration of the replicas is in progress, the failover is considered to be successful, and all the Sentinels are required to start reporting the new configuration.\\n  1097→\\n  1098→The way a new configuration is propagated is the reason why we need that every\\n  1099→Sentinel failover is authorized with a different version number (configuration epoch).\\n  1100→\\n  1101→Every Sentinel continuously broadcast its version of the configuration of a master using Redis Pub/Sub messages, both in the master and all the replicas.  At the same time all the Sentinels wait for messages to see what is the configuration\\n  1102→advertised by the other Sentinels.\\n  1103→\\n  1104→Configurations are broadcast in the `__sentinel__:hello` Pub/Sub channel.\\n  1105→\\n  1106→Because every configuration has a different version number, the greater version\\n  1107→always wins over smaller versions.\\n  1108→\\n  1109→So for example the configuration for the master `mymaster` start with all the\\n  1110→Sentinels believing the master is at 192.168.1.50:6379. This configuration\\n  1111→has version 1. After some time a Sentinel is authorized to failover with version 2. If the failover is successful, it will start to broadcast a new configuration, let\\'s say 192.168.1.50:9000, with version 2. All the other instances will see this configuration and will update their configuration accordingly, since the new configuration has a greater version.\\n  1112→\\n  1113→This means that Sentinel guarantees a second liveness property: a set of\\n  1114→Sentinels that are able to communicate will all converge to the same configuration with the higher version number.\\n  1115→\\n  1116→Basically if the net is partitioned, every partition will converge to the higher\\n  1117→local configuration. In the special case of no partitions, there is a single\\n  1118→partition and every Sentinel will agree about the configuration.\\n  1119→\\n  1120→### Consistency under partitions\\n  1121→\\n  1122→Redis Sentinel configurations are eventually consistent, so every partition will\\n  1123→converge to the higher configuration available.\\n  1124→However in a real-world system using Sentinel there are three different players:\\n  1125→\\n  1126→* Redis instances.\\n  1127→* Sentinel instances.\\n  1128→* Clients.\\n  1129→\\n  1130→In order to define the behavior of the system we have to consider all three.\\n  1131→\\n  1132→The following is a simple network where there are 3 nodes, each running\\n  1133→a Redis instance, and a Sentinel instance:\\n  1134→\\n  1135→                +-------------+\\n  1136→                | Sentinel 1  |----- Client A\\n  1137→                | Redis 1 (M) |\\n  1138→                +-------------+\\n  1139→                        |\\n  1140→                        |\\n  1141→    +-------------+     |          +------------+\\n  1142→    | Sentinel 2  |-----+-- // ----| Sentinel 3 |----- Client B\\n  1143→    | Redis 2 (S) |                | Redis 3 (M)|\\n  1144→    +-------------+                +------------+\\n  1145→\\n  1146→In this system the original state was that Redis 3 was the master, while\\n  1147→Redis 1 and 2 were replicas. A partition occurred isolating the old master.\\n  1148→Sentinels 1 and 2 started a failover promoting Sentinel 1 as the new master.\\n  1149→\\n  1150→The Sentinel properties guarantee that Sentinel 1 and 2 now have the new\\n  1151→configuration for the master. However Sentinel 3 has still the old configuration\\n  1152→since it lives in a different partition.\\n  1153→\\n  1154→We know that Sentinel 3 will get its configuration updated when the network\\n  1155→partition will heal, however what happens during the partition if there\\n  1156→are clients partitioned with the old master?\\n  1157→\\n  1158→Clients will be still able to write to Redis 3, the old master. When the\\n  1159→partition will rejoin, Redis 3 will be turned into a replica of Redis 1, and\\n  1160→all the data written during the partition will be lost.\\n  1161→\\n  1162→Depending on your configuration you may want or not that this scenario happens:\\n  1163→\\n  1164→* If you are using Redis as a cache, it could be handy that Client B is still able to write to the old master, even if its data will be lost.\\n  1165→* If you are using Redis as a store, this is not good and you need to configure the system in order to partially prevent this problem.\\n  1166→\\n  1167→Since Redis is asynchronously replicated, there is no way to totally prevent data loss in this scenario, however you can bound the divergence between Redis 3 and Redis 1\\n  1168→using the following Redis configuration option:\\n  1169→\\n  1170→    min-replicas-to-write 1\\n  1171→    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\n  1172→\\n  1173→With the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\n  1174→\\n  1175→Using this configuration the Redis 3 in the above example will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel 3 configuration will converge to\\n  1176→the new one, and Client B will be able to fetch a valid configuration and continue.\\n  1177→\\n  1178→In general Redis + Sentinel as a whole are an **eventually consistent system** where the merge function is **last failover wins**, and the data from old masters are discarded to replicate the data of the current master, so there is always a window for losing acknowledged writes. This is due to Redis asynchronous\\n  1179→replication and the discarding nature of the \"virtual\" merge function of the system. Note that this is not a limitation of Sentinel itself, and if you orchestrate the failover with a strongly consistent replicated state machine, the same properties will still apply. There are only two ways to avoid losing acknowledged writes:\\n  1180→\\n  1181→1. Use synchronous replication (and a proper consensus algorithm to run a replicated state machine).\\n  1182→2. Use an eventually consistent system where different versions of the same object can be merged.\\n  1183→\\n  1184→Redis currently is not able to use any of the above systems, and is currently outside the development goals. However there are proxies implementing solution \"2\" on top of Redis stores such as SoundCloud [Roshi](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi), or Netflix [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite).\\n  1185→\\n  1186→Sentinel persistent state\\n  1187→---\\n  1188→\\n  1189→Sentinel state is persisted in the sentinel configuration file.

Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Replicas (according to the current configuration) that claim to be masters, will be configured as replicas to replicate with the current master.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas connected to a wrong master, will be reconfigured to replicate with the right master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinels to reconfigure replicas, the wrong configuration must be observed for some time, that is greater than the period used to broadcast new configurations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis prevents Sentinels with a stale configuration (for example because they just rejoined from a partition) will try to change the replicas configuration before receiving an update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note how the semantics of always trying to impose the current configuration makes the failover more resistant to partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Masters failed over are reconfigured as replicas when they return available.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas partitioned away during a partition are reconfigured once reachable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe important lesson to remember about this section is: **Sentinel is a system where each process will always try to impose the last logical configuration to the set of monitored instances**.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.7468,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-027\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Algorithms and internals > Configuration propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Once a Sentinel is able to failover a master successfully, it will start to broadcast the new configuration so that the other Sentinels will update their information about a given master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor a failover to be considered successful, it requires that the Sentinel was able to send the `REPLICAOF NO ONE` command to the selected replica, and that the switch to master was later observed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) output of the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt this point, even if the reconfiguration of the replicas is in progress, the failover is considered to be successful, and all the Sentinels are required to start reporting the new configuration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe way a new configuration is propagated is the reason why we need that every\\\\\\\\nSentinel failover is authorized with a different version number (configuration epoch).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery Sentinel continuously broadcast its version of the configuration of a master using Redis Pub/Sub messages, both in the master and all the replicas.  At the same time all the Sentinels wait for messages to see what is the configuration\\\\\\\\nadvertised by the other Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfigurations are broadcast in the `__sentinel__:hello` Pub/Sub channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause every configuration has a different version number, the greater version\\\\\\\\nalways wins over smaller versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example the configuration for the master `mymaster` start with all the\\\\\\\\nSentinels believing the master is at 192.168.1.50:6379. This configuration\\\\\\\\nhas version 1. After some time a Sentinel is authorized to failover with version 2. If the failover is successful, it will start to broadcast a new configuration, let\\'s say 192.168.1.50:9000, with version 2. All the other instances will see this configuration and will update their configuration accordingly, since the new configuration has a greater version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that Sentinel guarantees a second liveness property: a set of\\\\\\\\nSentinels that are able to communicate will all converge to the same configuration with the higher version number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically if the net is partitioned, every partition will converge to the higher\\\\\\\\nlocal configuration. In the special case of no partitions, there is a single\\\\\\\\npartition and every Sentinel will agree about the configuration.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.9552,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-023\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > Replica selection and priority\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When a Sentinel instance is ready to perform a failover, since the master\\\\\\\\nis in `ODOWN` state and the Sentinel received the authorization to failover\\\\\\\\nfrom the majority of the Sentinel instances known, a suitable replica needs\\\\\\\\nto be selected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe replica selection process evaluates the following information about replicas:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

In order to actually perform a failover, one of the Sentinels need to be elected leader for the failover and be authorized to proceed. This only happens with the vote of the **majority of the Sentinel processes**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example if you have 5 Sentinel processes, and the quorum for a given\\\\\\\\nmaster set to the value of 2, this is what happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If two Sentinels agree at the same time about the master being unreachable, one of the two will try to start a failover.\\\\\\\\n* If there are at least a total of three Sentinels reachable, the failover will be authorized and will actually start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn practical terms this means during failures **Sentinel never starts a failover if the majority of Sentinel processes are unable to talk** (aka no failover in the minority partition).\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5231,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis service discovery via Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel is a monitoring solution for Redis instances that handles\\\\\\\\nautomatic failover of Redis masters and service discovery (who is the current\\\\\\\\nmaster for a given group of instances?).

Redis Cluster uses hash slots (16384 total) to distribute keys across nodes, and multi-key commands require all keys to be in the same slot.\n\n## Solutions\n\n**1. Use Hash Tags to Group Related Keys**\n\nHash tags force keys to hash to the same slot by using curly braces `{}`. Only the content inside the braces is used for hash slot calculation:\n\n```\n# These will hash to the same slot:\nuser:{123}:profile\nuser:{123}:settings\nuser:{123}:preferences\n\n# You can then run:\nSUNION user:{123}:set1 user:{123}:set2\n```\n\n**2. Redesign Your Data Model**\n\nMinimize cross-slot operations by:\n- Combining related data into single keys (e.g., using Redis Hashes instead of multiple keys)\n- Grouping keys that need to be operated together using hash tags\n- Avoiding operations that span multiple logical entities\n\n**3. Check Cluster State**\n\nCROSSSLOT can also appear during cluster resharding. Other related errors:\n- **MOVED**: Key has moved to a different node (during resharding)\n- **TRYAGAIN**: Operation temporarily unavailable (during migration)\n\n**4. Implement Retry Logic**\n\nFor temporary failures during cluster reconfiguration, implement retry logic in your application.\n\n## Key Concept\n\nRedis uses `HASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384` to determine which slot a key belongs to. Commands like SORT and SUNION that operate on multiple keys can only work if all keys map to the same slot on the same node.\n\n[来源:

Cluster implements a concept called *replica migration* in order to\\\\\\\\nimprove the availability of the system. The idea is that in a cluster with\\\\\\\\na master-replica setup, if the map between replicas and masters is fixed\\\\\\\\navailability is limited over time if multiple independent failures of single\\\\\\\\nnodes happen.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example in a cluster where every master has a single replica, the cluster\\\\\\\\ncan continue operations as long as either the master or the replica fail, but not\\\\\\\\nif both fail the same time. However there is a class of failures that are\\\\\\\\nthe independent failures of single nodes caused by hardware or software issues\\\\\\\\nthat can accumulate over time. For example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A has a single replica A1.\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted as new master.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails in an independent manner (unrelated to the failure of A). No other replica is available for promotion since node A is still down. The cluster cannot continue normal operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the map between masters and replicas is fixed, the only way to make the cluster\\\\\\\\nmore resistant to the above scenario is to add replicas to every master, however\\\\\\\\nthis is costly as it requires more instances of Redis to be executed, more\\\\\\\\nmemory, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn alternative is to create an asymmetry in the cluster, and let the cluster\\\\\\\\nlayout automatically change over time. For example the cluster may have three\\\\\\\\nmasters A, B, C. A and B have a single replica each, A1 and B1. However the master\\\\\\\\nC is different and has two replicas: C1 and C2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReplica migration is the process of automatic reconfiguration of a replica\\\\\\\\nin order to *migrate* to a master that has no longer coverage (no working\\\\\\\\nreplicas). With replica migration the scenario mentioned above turns into the\\\\\\\\nfollowing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted.\\\\\\\\n* C2 migrates as replica of A1, that is otherwise not backed by any replica.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails as well.\\\\\\\\n* C2 is promoted as new master to replace A1.\\\\\\\\n* The cluster can continue the operations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.3325,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Client and Server roles in the Redis cluster protocol\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In Redis Cluster, nodes are responsible for holding the data,\\\\\\\\nand taking the state of the cluster, including mapping keys to the right nodes.\\\\\\\\nCluster nodes are also able to auto-discover other nodes, detect non-working\\\\\\\\nnodes, and promote replica nodes to master when needed in order\\\\\\\\nto continue to operate when a failure occurs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo perform their tasks all the cluster nodes are connected using a\\\\\\\\nTCP bus and a binary protocol, called the **Redis Cluster Bus**.\\\\\\\\nEvery node is connected to every other node in the cluster using the cluster\\\\\\\\nbus.

While the specific error message \"Can't open the append-only file\" isn't directly mentioned, the documentation covers common AOF rewrite issues and their solutions.\n\n## Likely Causes\n\nThe \"Can't open the append-only file\" error during AOF rewrite typically indicates **file permission issues** rather than disk space problems. Here's what to check:\n\n### 1. **File Permissions**\n- The Redis process needs write permissions to the AOF directory\n- Check ownership of the AOF file and directory: `ls -la /path/to/redis/data`\n- Ensure Redis user has write access: `chown redis:redis /path/to/aof/directory`\n\n### 2. **AOF Rewrite Process (Redis >= 7.0)**\nThe rewrite mechanism works as follows:\n- Redis forks a child process\n- Child writes new base AOF to a **temporary file**\n- Parent opens a new increments AOF file\n- If rewrite fails, old files remain valid (safe fallback)\n- Child needs permission to create temp files in the AOF directory\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md > Append-only file > How it works]\n\n### 3. **Check AOF Status**\nMonitor the rewrite process:\n```bash\nredis-cli INFO persistence\n```\n\nLook for:\n- `aof_rewrite_in_progress`: should be 0 when idle\n- `aof_last_bgrewrite_status`: should show \"ok\" or error details\n- `aof_rewrite_scheduled`: indicates if rewrite is pending\n\n### 4. **Signal Handling**\nIf the AOF rewrite child process is killed by a signal, Redis treats it as an error and discards the partial AOF file, then retries later. Check Redis logs for signal-related messages.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md > Kill the RDB file without errors]\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n1. **Check Redis logs** for detailed error messages\n2. **Verify directory permissions**: `namei -l /path/to/redis/appendonly.aof`\n3. **Check SELinux/AppArmor** if enabled (may block file creation)\n4. **Verify ulimit** for Redis process: `cat /proc/<redis-pid>/limits`\n5. **Check for read-only filesystem**: `mount | grep /path/to/redis`\n\nIf the AOF file itself is corrupted, use `redis-check-aof --fix` to repair it, but this specific error suggests a permission/access issue rather than corruption.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md > What should I do if my AOF gets corrupted?]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["AOF", "rewrite", "append", "monitor", "search"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "a89ab1af-0818-46e5-857f-845bca68d493", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "f487de36-9769-4de8-8579-aff6e5fa0798", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='I\\'ll search for information about Redis AOF rewrite failures with the \"Can\\'t open the append-only file\" error.')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_0qM6eHr0tvdkyCjUYOiFK3', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': \"Can't open the append-only file|AOF rewrite|appendonly\"})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_b0o3RtgdlaLCo7B441RLj0', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': \"Redis AOF rewrite failing can't open append-only file permission error\", 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_0qM6eHr0tvdkyCjUYOiFK3', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_b0o3RtgdlaLCo7B441RLj0', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8572,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Append-only file > How it works\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Log rewriting uses the same copy-on-write trick already in use for\\\\\\\\nsnapshotting.

Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for. However\\\\\\\\nthere is not just a single swap field since the smaps file contains the\\\\\\\\ndifferent memory maps of our Redis process (The memory layout of a process\\\\\\\\nis more complex than a simple linear array of pages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince we are interested in all the memory swapped by our process the first thing\\\\\\\\nto do is to grep for the Swap field across all the file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | grep \\'Swap:\\'\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf everything is 0 kB, or if there are sporadic 4k entries, everything is\\\\\\\\nperfectly normal.

If this is the case with your\\\\\\\\nRedis instance you can further verify it using the **vmstat** command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ vmstat 1\\\\\\\\n    procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----\\\\\\\\n     r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697932 147180 1406456    0    0     2     2    2    0  4  4 91  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697428 147180 1406580    0    0     0     0 19088 16104  9  6 84  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697296 147180 1406616    0    0     0    28 18936 16193  7  6 87  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697048 147180 1406640    0    0     0     0 18613 15987  6  6 88  0\\\\\\\\n     2  0   3980 696924 147180 1406656    0    0     0     0 18744 16299  6  5 88  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697048 147180 1406688    0    0     0     4 18520 15974  6  6 88  0\\\\\\\\n    ^C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe interesting part of the output for our needs are the two columns **si**\\\\\\\\nand **so**, that counts the amount of memory swapped from/to the swap file.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server.

Even if continuous latency spikes are measured for a given event, which could happen with a low threshold, at least 160 seconds of history are available.\\\\\\\\n* Records the all-time maximum latency for every element.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe framework monitors and logs latency spikes in the execution time of these events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `command`: regular commands.\\\\\\\\n* `fast-command`: O(1) and O(log N) commands.\\\\\\\\n* `fork`: the `fork(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n* `rdb-unlink-temp-file`: the `unlink(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-fsync-always`: the `fsync(2)` system call when invoked by the `appendfsync allways` policy.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write`: writing to the AOF - a catchall event for `write(2)` system calls.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write-pending-fsync`: the `write(2)` system call when there is a pending fsync.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write-active-child`: the `write(2)` system call when there are active child processes.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write-alone`: the `write(2)` system call when no pending fsync and no active child process.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-fstat`: the `fstat(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-rename`: the `rename(2)` system call for renaming the temporary file after completing [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof).\\\\\\\\n* `aof-rewrite-diff-write`: writing the differences accumulated while performing [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof).\\\\\\\\n* `active-defrag-cycle`: the active defragmentation cycle.\\\\\\\\n* `expire-cycle`: the expiration cycle.\\\\\\\\n* `eviction-cycle`: the eviction cycle.\\\\\\\\n* `eviction-del`: deletes during the eviction cycle.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.0811,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency-monitor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis latency monitoring\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis is often used for demanding use cases, where it\\\\\\\\nserves a large number of queries per second per instance, but also has strict latency requirements for the average response\\\\\\\\ntime and the worst-case latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile Redis is an in-memory system, it deals with the operating system in\\\\\\\\ndifferent ways, for example, in the context of persisting to disk.\\\\\\\\nMoreover Redis implements a rich set of commands.

The documentation mentions that sorted sets can be used to \"build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\"\n\n## How It Works\n\nA sliding-window rate limiter using sorted sets leverages these key properties:\n\n1. **Sorted by timestamp**: Each API request is stored as a member in the sorted set, with the timestamp as the score\n2. **Automatic ordering**: Members are automatically ordered by their scores (timestamps)\n3. **Range operations**: You can efficiently query and remove requests outside the time window\n4. **O(log(N)) complexity**: Adding elements is fast even with millions of entries\n\n## Implementation Pattern\n\n```redis\n# Add a new request (current timestamp as score)\nZADD rate_limiter:<user_id> <current_timestamp> <request_id>\n\n# Remove requests older than the time window (e.g., 60 seconds ago)\nZREMRANGEBYSCORE rate_limiter:<user_id> -inf <timestamp_60_seconds_ago>\n\n# Count requests in the current window\nZCOUNT rate_limiter:<user_id> <timestamp_60_seconds_ago> +inf\n\n# If count exceeds limit, reject the request\n```\n\n## Key Commands\n\n- **ZADD**: Adds a new request with timestamp as score\n- **ZREMRANGEBYSCORE**: Removes old requests outside the time window\n- **ZCOUNT** or **ZRANGE**: Counts requests in the current window\n- **ZRANGEBYSCORE**: Retrieves requests within a specific time range\n\n## Performance Characteristics\n\n- Adding elements: **O(log(N))** time complexity\n- Range queries: **O(log(N) + M)** where M is the number of results\n- Sorted sets use a dual-ported data structure (skip list + hash table) for efficient operations\n\n[Source: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md]", "tools_used": ["Grep",

score.\\\\\\\\nWhen more than one string has the same score, the strings are ordered lexicographically.\\\\\\\\nSome use cases for sorted sets include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Leaderboards. For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.1621,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Lexicographical scores\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In version Redis 2.8, a new feature was introduced that allows\\\\\\\\ngetting ranges lexicographically, assuming elements in a sorted set are all\\\\\\\\ninserted with the same identical score (elements are compared with the C\\\\\\\\n`memcmp` function, so it is guaranteed that there is no collation, and every\\\\\\\\nRedis instance will reply with the same output).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe main commands to operate with lexicographical ranges are [`ZRANGEBYLEX`](),\\\\\\\\n[`ZREVRANGEBYLEX`](), [`ZREMRANGEBYLEX`]() and [`ZLEXCOUNT`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, let\\'s add again our list of famous racers, but this time\\\\\\\\nusing a score of zero for all the elements. We\\'ll see that because of the sorted sets ordering rules, they are already sorted lexicographically. Using [`ZRANGEBYLEX`]() we can ask for lexicographical ranges:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGEBYLEX racer_scores [A [L\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRanges can be inclusive or exclusive (depending on the first character),\\\\\\\\nalso string infinite and minus infinite are specified respectively with\\\\\\\\nthe `+` and `-` strings. See the documentation for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is important because it allows us to use sorted sets as a generic\\\\\\\\nindex. For example, if you want to index elements by a 128-bit unsigned\\\\\\\\ninteger argument, all you need to do is to add elements into a sorted\\\\\\\\nset with the same score (for example 0) but with a 16 byte prefix\\\\\\\\nconsisting of **the 128 bit number in big endian**. Since numbers in big\\\\\\\\nendian, when ordered lexicographically (in raw bytes order) are actually\\\\\\\\nordered numerically as well, you can ask for ranges in the 128 bit space,\\\\\\\\nand get the element\\'s value discarding the prefix\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdating the score: leaderboards\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust a final note about sorted sets before switching to the next topic.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets\\' scores can be updated at any time. Just calling [`ZADD`]() against\\\\\\\\nan element already included in the sorted set will update its score\\\\\\\\n(and position) with O(log(N)) time complexity.  As such, sorted sets are suitable\\\\\\\\nwhen there are tons of updates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of this characteristic a common use case is leaderboards.\\\\\\\\nThe typical application is a Facebook game where you combine the ability to\\\\\\\\ntake users sorted by their high score, plus the get-rank operation, in order\\\\\\\\nto show the top-N users, and the user rank in the leader board (e.g., \\\\\\\\\\\\\"you are\\\\\\\\nthe #4932 best score here\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.752,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Learn more\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* There are two ways we can use a sorted set to represent a leaderboard. If we know a racer\\'s new score, we can update it directly via the [`ZADD`]() command. However, if we want to add points to an existing score, we can use the [`ZINCRBY`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 100 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wood\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 100 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 150 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> ZINCRBY racer_scores 50 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wood\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"150\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZINCRBY racer_scores 50 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"200\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll see that [`ZADD`]() returns 0 when the member already exists (the score is updated), while [`ZINCRBY`]() returns the new score. The score for racer Henshaw went from 100, was changed to 150 with no regard for what score was there before, and then was incremented by 50 to 200.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`ZADD`]() adds a new member and associated score to a sorted set. If the member already exists, the score is updated.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZRANGE`]() returns members of a sorted set, sorted within a given range.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZRANK`]() returns the rank of the provided member, assuming the sorted set is in ascending order.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZREVRANK`]() returns the rank of the provided member, assuming the sorted set is in descending order.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of sorted set commands](?group=sorted-set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost sorted set operations are O(log(n)), where _n_ is the number of members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExercise some caution when running the [`ZRANGE`]() command with large returns values (e.g., in the tens of thousands or more).\\\\\\\\nThis command\\'s time complexity is O(log(n) + m), where _m_ is the number of results returned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis sorted sets are sometimes used for indexing other Redis data structures.\\\\\\\\nIf you need to index and query your data, consider the [JSON]() data type and the [Redis Query Engine]() features.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Redis Sorted Sets Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUKlxdBQZ7g) is an entertaining introduction to sorted sets in Redis.\\\\\\\\n* [Redis University\\'s RU101](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/) explores Redis sorted sets in detail.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4312,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples > What are Lists?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To explain the List data type it\\'s better to start with a little bit of theory,\\\\\\\\nas the term *List* is often used in an improper way by information technology\\\\\\\\nfolks. For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4041,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Limits\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The [`SADD`]() command adds new elements to a set. It\\'s also possible\\\\\\\\nto do a number of other operations against sets like testing if a given element\\\\\\\\nalready exists, performing the intersection, union or difference between\\\\\\\\nmultiple sets, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> SMEMBERS bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) bike:3\\\\\\\\n2) bike:1\\\\\\\\n3) bike:2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere I\\'ve added three elements to my set and told Redis to return all the\\\\\\\\nelements. There is no order guarantee with a set. Redis is free to return the\\\\\\\\nelements in any order at every call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has commands to test for set membership. These commands can be used on single as well as multiple items:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> SISMEMBER bikes:racing:france bike:1\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SMISMEMBER bikes:racing:france bike:2 bike:3 bike:4\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can also find the difference between two sets. For instance, we may want\\\\\\\\nto know which bikes are racing in France but not in the USA:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:usa bike:1 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are other non trivial operations that are still easy to implement\\\\\\\\nusing the right Redis commands. For instance we may want a list of all the\\\\\\\\nbikes racing in France, the USA, and some other races. We can do this using\\\\\\\\nthe [`SINTER`]() command, which performs the intersection between different\\\\\\\\nsets. In addition to intersection you can also perform\\\\\\\\nunions, difference, and more. For example \\\\\\\\nif we add a third race we can see some of these commands in action:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:usa bike:1 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:italy bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> SINTER bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SUNION bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(empty array)\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll note that the [`SDIFF`]() command returns an empty array when the\\\\\\\\ndifference between all sets is empty. You\\'ll also note that the order of sets\\\\\\\\npassed to [`SDIFF`]() matters, since the difference is not commutative.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you want to remove items from a set, you can use the [`SREM`]() command to\\\\\\\\nremove one or more items from a set, or you can use the [`SPOP`]() command to\\\\\\\\nremove a random item from a set. You can also _return_ a random item from a\\\\\\\\nset without removing it using the [`SRANDMEMBER`]() command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> SREM bikes:racing:france bike:1\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SPOP bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SMEMBERS bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SRANDMEMBER bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe max size of a Redis set is 2^32 - 1 (4,294,967,295) members.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.2768,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Operating on ranges\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Sorted sets are more powerful than this.

It's designed to be simple to implement, fast to parse, and human-readable.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n- **Binary-safe**: Uses prefixed length for bulk data transfer\n- **Multiple data types**: Supports integers, strings, arrays, errors, and more\n- **Request-response model**: Client sends commands as arrays, server replies with typed responses\n- **TCP-based**: Clients connect via TCP (default port 6379)\n\n### Protocol Versions\n\n- **RESP2**: Standard since Redis 2.0, still widely used\n- **RESP3**: Introduced in Redis 6.0 with enhanced features (opt-in via `HELLO` command)\n- Both versions remain supported in Redis 7+\n\n### Client-Server Communication Flow\n\n1. **Connection**: Client establishes TCP connection to Redis server (port 6379)\n\n2. **Handshake** (recommended): Client sends `HELLO` command to negotiate protocol version\n   ```\n   Client: HELLO 3\n   Server: (returns map with server info, version, protocol)\n   ```\n\n3. **Command Execution**: \n   - Client sends commands as **RESP arrays of bulk strings**\n   - First element is the command name, subsequent elements are arguments\n   - Server processes and replies with appropriate RESP type\n\n4. **Example** - `LLEN mylist` command:\n   ```\n   Client: *2\\r\\n$4\\r\\nLLEN\\r\\n$6\\r\\nmylist\\r\\n\n   Server: :48293\\r\\n\n   ```\n   (Array of 2 elements → bulk string \"LLEN\" → bulk string \"mylist\" → integer reply)\n\n### Data Type Encoding\n\nEach RESP type starts with a specific first byte:\n- `+` Simple strings\n- `-` Errors  \n- `:` Integers\n- `$` Bulk strings\n- `*` Arrays\n- RESP3 adds: `_` (null), `#` (boolean), `,` (double), `%` (map), etc.\n\n### Special Cases\n\n- **Pipelining**: Clients can send multiple commands without waiting for replies\n- **Pub/Sub**:

\\\\\"To communicate with the Redis server, Redis clients use a protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.4024,\\\\n

different arguments.\\\\\\\\nThen, the server processes the command and sends the reply back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the simplest model possible; however, there are some exceptions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis requests can be [pipelined](#multiple-commands-and-pipelining).\\\\\\\\n  Pipelining enables clients to send multiple commands at once and wait for replies later.\\\\\\\\n* When a RESP2 connection subscribes to a [Pub/Sub]() channel, the protocol changes semantics and becomes a *push* protocol.\\\\\\\\n  The client no longer requires sending commands because the server will automatically send new messages to the client (for the channels the client is subscribed to) as soon as they are received.\\\\\\\\n* The [`MONITOR`]() command.\\\\\\\\n  Invoking the [`MONITOR`]() command switches the connection to an ad-hoc push mode.\\\\\\\\n  The protocol of this mode is not specified but is obvious to parse.\\\\\\\\n* [Protected mode]().\\\\\\\\n  Connections opened from a non-loopback address to a Redis while in protected mode are denied and terminated by the server.\\\\\\\\n  Before terminating the connection, Redis unconditionally sends a `-DENIED` reply, regardless of whether the client writes to the socket.\\\\\\\\n* The [RESP3 Push type](#resp3-pushes).\\\\\\\\n  As the name suggests, a push type allows the server to send out-of-band data to the connection.\\\\\\\\n  The server may push data at any time, and the data isn\\'t necessarily related to specific commands executed by the client.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nExcluding these exceptions, the Redis protocol is a simple request-response protocol.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.2774,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244\\\\\",\\\\n

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"RESP is essentially a serialization protocol that supports several data types.\\\\\\\\nIn RESP, the first byte of data determines its type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis generally uses RESP as a [request-response](#request-response-model) protocol in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients send commands to a Redis server as an [array](#arrays) of [bulk strings](#bulk-strings).\\\\\\\\n  The first (and sometimes also the second) bulk string in the array is the command\\'s name.\\\\\\\\n  Subsequent elements of the array are the arguments for the command.\\\\\\\\n* The server replies with a RESP type.\\\\\\\\n  The reply\\'s type is determined by the command\\'s implementation and possibly by the client\\'s protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a binary protocol that uses control sequences encoded in standard ASCII.\\\\\\\\nThe `A` character, for example, is encoded with the binary byte of value 65.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the characters CR (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`), LF (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) and SP (` `) have binary byte values of 13, 10 and 32, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` (CRLF) is the protocol\\'s _terminator_, which **always** separates its parts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first byte in an RESP-serialized payload always identifies its type.\\\\\\\\nSubsequent bytes constitute the type\\'s contents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe categorize every RESP data type as either _simple_, _bulk_ or _aggregate_.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimple types are similar to scalars in programming languages that represent plain literal values. Booleans and Integers are such examples.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP strings are either _simple_ or _bulk_.\\\\\\\\nSimple strings never contain carriage return (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`) or line feed (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) characters.\\\\\\\\nBulk strings can contain any binary data and may also be referred to as _binary_ or _blob_.\\\\\\\\nNote that bulk strings may be further encoded and decoded, e.g. with a wide multi-byte encoding, by the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAggregates, such as Arrays and Maps, can have varying numbers of sub-elements and nesting levels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following table summarizes the RESP data types that Redis supports:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| RESP data type | Minimal protocol version | Category | First byte |\\\\\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\\\\\n| [Simple strings](#simple-strings) | RESP2 | Simple | `+` |\\\\\\\\n| [Simple Errors](#simple-errors) | RESP2 | Simple | `-` |\\\\\\\\n| [Integers](#integers) | RESP2 | Simple | `:` |\\\\\\\\n| [Bulk strings](#bulk-strings) | RESP2 | Aggregate | `$` |\\\\\\\\n| [Arrays](#arrays) | RESP2 | Aggregate | `*` |\\\\\\\\n| [Nulls](#nulls) | RESP3 | Simple | `_` |\\\\\\\\n| [Booleans](#booleans) | RESP3 | Simple | `#` |\\\\\\\\n| [Doubles](#doubles) | RESP3 | Simple | `,` |\\\\\\\\n| [Big numbers](#big-numbers) | RESP3 | Simple | `(` |\\\\\\\\n| [Bulk errors](#bulk-errors) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `!` |\\\\\\\\n| [Verbatim strings](#verbatim-strings) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `=` |\\\\\\\\n| [Maps](#maps) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `%` |\\\\\\\\n| [Attributes](#attributes) | RESP3 | Aggregate | <code>&#124;</code> |\\\\\\\\n| [Sets](#sets) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `~` |\\\\\\\\n| [Pushes](#pushes) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `>` |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"simple-string-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.1516,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/protocol-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis serialization protocol specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sending commands to a Redis server\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"New RESP connections should begin the session by calling the [`HELLO`]() command.\\\\\\\\nThis practice accomplishes two things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. It allows servers to be backward compatible with RESP2 versions.\\\\\\\\n  This is needed in Redis to make the transition to version 3 of the protocol gentler.\\\\\\\\n2. The [`HELLO`]() command returns information about the server and the protocol that the client can use for different goals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`HELLO`]() command has the following high-level syntax:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HELLO <protocol-version> [optional-arguments]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first argument of the command is the protocol version we want the connection to be set.\\\\\\\\nBy default, the connection starts in RESP2 mode.\\\\\\\\nIf we specify a connection version that is too big and unsupported by the server, it should reply with a `-NOPROTO` error. Example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 4\\\\\\\\n    Server: -NOPROTO sorry, this protocol version is not supported.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\nAt that point, the client may retry with a lower protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the client can easily detect a server that is only able to speak RESP2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR unknown command \\'HELLO\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client can then proceed and use RESP2 to communicate with the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that even if the protocol\\'s version is supported, the [`HELLO`]() command may return an error, perform no action and remain in RESP2 mode. \\\\\\\\nFor example, when used with invalid authentication credentials in the command\\'s optional `AUTH` clause:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3 AUTH default mypassword\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR invalid password\\\\\\\\n    (the connection remains in RESP2 mode)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA successful reply to the [`HELLO`]() command is a map reply.\\\\\\\\nThe information in the reply is partly server-dependent, but certain fields are mandatory for all the RESP3 implementations:\\\\\\\\n* **server**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"redis\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (or other software name).\\\\\\\\n* **version**: the server\\'s version.\\\\\\\\n* **proto**: the highest supported version of the RESP protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis\\' RESP3 implementation, the following fields are also emitted:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **id**: the connection\\'s identifier (ID).\\\\\\\\n* **mode**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"standalone\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cluster\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **role**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"master\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"replica\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **modules**: list of loaded modules as an Array of Bulk Strings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that you are familiar with the RESP serialization format, you can use it to help write a Redis client library.\\\\\\\\nWe can further specify how the interaction between the client and the server works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A client sends the Redis server an [array](#arrays) consisting of only bulk strings.\\\\\\\\n* A Redis server replies to clients, sending any valid RESP data type as a reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, for example, a typical interaction could be the following.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client sends the command `LLEN mylist` to get the length of the list stored at the key _mylist_.\\\\\\\\nThen the server replies with an [integer](#integers) reply as in the following example (`C:` is the client, `S:` the server).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: $4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: LLEN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: $6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: mylist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    S: :48293\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs usual, we separate different parts of the protocol with newlines for simplicity, but the actual interaction is the client sending `*2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLLEN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nmylist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` as a whole.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.9688,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\":

as RESP arrays.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, some Redis commands that return collections of elements use arrays as their replies. \\\\\\\\nAn example is the [`LRANGE`]() command that returns elements of a list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP Arrays\\' encoding uses the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *<number-of-elements>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n<element-1>...<element-n>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An asterisk (`*`) as the first byte.\\\\\\\\n* One or more decimal digits (`0`..`9`) as the number of elements in the array as an unsigned, base-10 value.\\\\\\\\n* The CRLF terminator.\\\\\\\\n* An additional RESP type for every element of the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo an empty Array is just the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhereas the encoding of an array consisting of the two bulk strings \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"world\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nhello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nworld\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see, after the `*<count>CRLF` part prefixing the array, the other data types that compose the array are concatenated one after the other.\\\\\\\\nFor example, an Array of three integers is encoded as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArrays can contain mixed data types.\\\\\\\\nFor instance, the following encoding is of a list of four integers and a bulk string:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(The raw RESP encoding is split into multiple lines for readability).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first line the server sent is `*5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`.\\\\\\\\nThis numeric value tells the client that five reply types are about to follow it.\\\\\\\\nThen, every successive reply constitutes an element in the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of the aggregate RESP types support nesting.\\\\\\\\nFor example, a nested array of two arrays is encoded as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    +Hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    -World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(The raw RESP encoding is split into multiple lines for readability).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above encodes a two-element array.\\\\\\\\nThe first element is an array that, in turn, contains three integers (1, 2, 3).\\\\\\\\nThe second element is another array containing a simple string and an error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn some places, the RESP Array type may be referred to as _multi bulk_.\\\\\\\\nThe two are the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nil-array-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n

However, only **14 out of 16 bits** are used, giving 2^14 = 16384 slots. This provides good distribution while keeping the slot bitmap compact.\n\n2. **Reasonable cluster size limit**: 16384 slots effectively sets an upper limit of 16384 master nodes, though the recommended maximum is around 1000 nodes for practical operations.\n\n3. **Efficient propagation**: Each node broadcasts its slot configuration in heartbeat messages. With 16384 slots, the bitmap is 2KB (16384 bits / 8), which is reasonable for network transmission. A larger number would increase overhead.\n\n## How Keys Are Mapped\n\nKeys are mapped to hash slots using this algorithm:\n\n```\nHASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\n```\n\n**CRC16 specification used:**\n- Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\n- Width: 16 bit\n- Poly: 1021 (x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\n- Initialization: 0000\n- Output for \"123456789\": 31C3\n\n**Hash Tags Exception**: If a key contains `{...}` brackets, only the substring inside the brackets is hashed. For example:\n- `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` → both hash to the same slot (only `123` is hashed)\n- This allows multi-key operations on keys in the same slot\n\nEach master node is responsible for a subset of the 16384 slots. For example, in a 3-node cluster:\n- Node A: slots 0-5500\n- Node B: slots 5501-11000  \n- Node C: slots 11001-16383\n\n[来源:

but a different form of sharding\\\\\\\\nwhere every key is conceptually part of what we call a **hash slot**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute the hash\\\\\\\\nslot for a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo\\\\\\\\n16384.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,\\\\\\\\nso, for example, you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.\\\\\\\\n* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.\\\\\\\\n* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes it easy to add and remove cluster nodes. For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.2801,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-025\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration handling, propagation, and failovers > Hash slots configuration propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"An important part of Redis Cluster is the mechanism used to propagate the information about which cluster node is serving a given set of hash slots. This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.8861,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > MOVED Redirection\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis client is free to send queries to every node in the cluster, including\\\\\\\\nreplica nodes.

数据后删除了 2GB，RSS（实际物理内存占用）仍可能保持在 5GB\n- 这是因为被删除的键和仍存在的键可能分配在相同的内存页上，分配器无法轻易释放\n\n## 处理方法\n\n### 1. **理解碎片率计算**\n碎片率 = RSS（物理内存） / 实际使用内存\n\n你的情况：10GB / 2GB = 5.0 的碎片率，属于严重碎片化。\n\n### 2. **内存分配器会自动复用**\n- 当你重新添加数据时，分配器会尝试复用之前释放的内存空间\n- RSS 不会继续增长，直到填满之前释放的空间\n\n### 3. **主动处理方案**\n\n**方案 A：重启 Redis 实例**（最直接）\n- 重启后内存会完全释放，碎片率恢复正常\n- 适用于有主从复制或持久化的场景\n\n**方案 B：配置内存上限**\n```bash\n# 在 redis.conf 中设置\nmaxmemory 3gb\n\n# 或运行时设置\nCONFIG SET maxmemory 3gb\n```\n- 根据实际数据量设置合理上限（建议预留 20-30% 缓冲）\n- 配合 `maxmemory-policy` 设置淘汰策略\n\n**方案 C：按峰值内存规划**\n- 如果业务有周期性的内存峰值，需要按峰值而非平均值规划内存\n-

\\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory allocation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To store user keys, Redis allocates at most as much memory as the `maxmemory`\\\\\\\\nsetting enables (however there are small extra allocations possible).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe exact value can be set in the configuration file or set later via\\\\\\\\n[`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) (for more info, see [Using memory as an LRU cache]()).\\\\\\\\nThere are a few things that should be noted about how Redis manages memory:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis will not always free up (return) memory to the OS when keys are removed.\\\\\\\\nThis is not something special about Redis, but it is how most malloc() implementations work.\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you fill an instance with 5GB worth of data, and then\\\\\\\\nremove the equivalent of 2GB of data, the Resident Set Size (also known as\\\\\\\\nthe RSS, which is the number of memory pages consumed by the process)\\\\\\\\nwill probably still be around 5GB, even if Redis will claim that the user\\\\\\\\nmemory is around 3GB.  This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory error for write commands if and when it reaches the \\\\\\\\nlimit - which in turn may result in errors in the application but will not render the \\\\\\\\nwhole machine dead because of memory starvation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.2994,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/admin.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis administration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis setup tips > Replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Deploy Redis using the Linux operating system. Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.4479,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"57ddb20a\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"57ddb20a-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-native-types.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API for native types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Register a new data type > Allocate memory\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules data types should try to use `RedisModule_Alloc()` functions family\\\\\\\\nin order to allocate, reallocate and release heap memory used to implement the native data structures (see the other Redis Modules documentation for detailed information).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is not just useful in order for Redis to be able to account for the memory used by the module, but there are also more advantages:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis uses the `jemalloc` allocator, that often prevents fragmentation problems that could be caused by using the libc allocator.\\\\\\\\n* When loading strings from the RDB file, the native types API is able to return strings allocated directly with `RedisModule_Alloc()`, so that the module can directly link this memory into the data structure representation, avoiding a useless copy of the data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if you are using external libraries implementing your data structures, the\\\\\\\\nallocation functions provided by the module API is exactly compatible with\\\\\\\\n`malloc()`, `realloc()`, `free()` and `strdup()`, so converting the libraries\\\\\\\\nin order to use these functions should be trivial.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn case you have an external library that uses libc `malloc()`, and you want\\\\\\\\nto avoid replacing manually all the calls with the Redis Modules API calls,\\\\\\\\nan approach could be to use simple macros in order to replace the libc calls\\\\\\\\nwith the Redis API calls.

Prevent Data Loss During Partitions**\n\nAdd these settings to your Redis master configuration to stop accepting writes if replicas are unavailable:\n\n```\nmin-replicas-to-write 1\nmin-replicas-max-lag 10\n```\n\nThis ensures the master becomes unavailable after 10 seconds if it can't reach at least 1 replica, preventing writes to an isolated old master during network partitions.\n\n## Why 3 Nodes Minimum?\n\n**Never use just 2 Sentinels** - if the master box fails, the remaining Sentinel cannot authorize failover (no majority). You need at least 3 Sentinels in 3 different boxes to:\n- Achieve consensus on failures\n- Authorize failovers with majority agreement\n- Prevent permanent split-brain conditions\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n- **Advantage**: Simple setup with proper HA guarantees\n- **Trade-off**: If both replicas are down, the master stops accepting writes (when using `min-replicas-to-write`)\n- **Risk**: Some acknowledged writes may still be lost due to asynchronous replication\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Example 2: basic setup with three boxes]",

configurations are eventually consistent, so every partition will\\\\\\\\nconverge to the higher configuration available.\\\\\\\\nHowever in a real-world system using Sentinel there are three different players:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* Clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to define the behavior of the system we have to consider all three.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is a simple network where there are 3 nodes, each running\\\\\\\\na Redis instance, and a Sentinel instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n                +-------------+\\\\\\\\n                | Sentinel 1  |----- Client A\\\\\\\\n                | Redis 1 (M) |\\\\\\\\n                +-------------+\\\\\\\\n                        |\\\\\\\\n                        |\\\\\\\\n    +-------------+     |          +------------+\\\\\\\\n    | Sentinel 2  |-----+-- // ----| Sentinel 3 |----- Client B\\\\\\\\n    | Redis 2 (S) |                | Redis 3 (M)|\\\\\\\\n    +-------------+                +------------+\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this system the original state was that Redis 3 was the master, while\\\\\\\\nRedis 1 and 2 were replicas. A partition occurred isolating the old master.\\\\\\\\nSentinels 1 and 2 started a failover promoting Sentinel 1 as the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Sentinel properties guarantee that Sentinel 1 and 2 now have the new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration for the master. However Sentinel 3 has still the old configuration\\\\\\\\nsince it lives in a different partition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe know that Sentinel 3 will get its configuration updated when the network\\\\\\\\npartition will heal, however what happens during the partition if there\\\\\\\\nare clients partitioned with the old master?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients will be still able to write to Redis 3, the old master. When the\\\\\\\\npartition will rejoin, Redis 3 will be turned into a replica of Redis 1, and\\\\\\\\nall the data written during the partition will be lost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDepending on your configuration you may want or not that this scenario happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a cache, it could be handy that Client B is still able to write to the old master, even if its data will be lost.\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a store, this is not good and you need to configure the system in order to partially prevent this problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis is asynchronously replicated, there is no way to totally prevent data loss in this scenario, however you can bound the divergence between Redis 3 and Redis 1\\\\\\\\nusing the following Redis configuration option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration the Redis 3 in the above example will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel 3 configuration will converge to\\\\\\\\nthe new one, and Client B will be able to fetch a valid configuration and continue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general Redis + Sentinel as a whole are an **eventually consistent system** where the merge function is **last failover wins**, and the data from old masters are discarded to replicate the data of the current master, so there is always a window for losing acknowledged writes. This is due to Redis asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication and the discarding nature of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merge function of the system. Note that this is not a limitation of Sentinel itself, and if you orchestrate the failover with a strongly consistent replicated state machine, the same properties will still apply. There are only two ways to avoid losing acknowledged writes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Use synchronous replication (and a proper consensus algorithm to run a replicated state machine).\\\\\\\\n2. Use an eventually consistent system where different versions of the same object can be merged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis currently is not able to use any of the above systems, and is currently outside the development goals. However there are proxies implementing solution \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on top of Redis stores such as SoundCloud [Roshi](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi), or Netflix [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel persistent state\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel state is persisted in the sentinel configuration file. For example\\\\\\\\nevery time a new configuration is received, or created (leader Sentinels), for\\\\\\\\na master, the configuration is persisted on disk together with the configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch. This means that it is safe to stop and restart Sentinel processes.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.0283,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel quick start > Example Sentinel deployments > Example 4: Sentinel client side with less than three clients\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The setup described in the Example 3 cannot be used if there are less than\\\\\\\\nthree boxes in the client side (for example three web servers).

However clients, like C1, that are\\\\\\\\nin the same partition as the old master, may continue to write data\\\\\\\\nto the old master. This data will be lost forever since when the partition\\\\\\\\nwill heal, the master will be reconfigured as a replica of the new master,\\\\\\\\ndiscarding its data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis problem can be mitigated using the following Redis replication\\\\\\\\nfeature, that allows to stop accepting writes if a master detects that\\\\\\\\nit is no longer able to transfer its writes to the specified number of replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica.

scripts:\n\n## Key Differences\n\n**Redis Functions (introduced in Redis 7.0):**\n- **First-class database artifacts** — managed by Redis itself, persisted via AOF and replicated to replicas\n- **Declared before use** — loaded once at startup, no runtime loading required\n- **Named and versioned** — each function has a unique user-defined name for easier tracing\n- **Organized in libraries** — multiple functions can share code within the same library\n- **Durable** — stored alongside data, survive restarts and failovers\n- **No transaction failures** — since they're pre-loaded, no risk of missing scripts in transactions\n\n**Lua Scripts (EVAL/EVALSHA):**\n- **Ephemeral** — part of the client application, not the database\n- **Sent on every execution** — unless cached with EVALSHA (but cache can be lost)\n- **Anonymous** — identified only by SHA1 digest, making debugging harder\n- **No code sharing** — scripts can't call other scripts\n- **Volatile** — lost after server restart, failover, or SCRIPT FLUSH\n- **Application responsibility** — client must reload scripts if missing\n\n## When to Use Which?\n\n**Use Redis Functions when:**\n- Building reusable server-side logic that multiple applications will use\n- You need guaranteed availability without runtime loading\n- Code sharing between functions is important\n- You want easier debugging with meaningful function names\n- The logic is part of your data schema/consistency layer\n\n**Use Lua Scripts (EVAL) when:**\n- Lightweight, application-specific logic\n- Rapid prototyping or one-off operations\n- The script is tightly coupled to a specific application version\n- You need the Lua debugger (not available for Functions)\n\n## Common Ground\n\nBoth provide:\n- Atomic execution (blocks server during runtime)\n- Access to Redis commands via `redis.call()` / `redis.pcall()`\n- Same Lua 5.1 interpreter and API\n- Script effects replication (default since Redis 5.0)\n\n[来源:

[`redis.pcall()`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two are nearly identical.\\\\\\\\nBoth execute a Redis command along with its provided arguments, if these represent a well-formed command.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as generic as possible and provide customized execution via their arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA script is loaded to the server\\'s cache by calling the [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() command and providing its source code.\\\\\\\\nThe server doesn\\'t execute the script, but instead just compiles and loads it to the server\\'s cache.\\\\\\\\nOnce loaded, you can execute the cached script with the SHA1 digest returned from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example

evolutionary step from ephemeral scripting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions provide the same core functionality as scripts but are first-class software artifacts of the database.\\\\\\\\nRedis manages functions as an integral part of the database and ensures their availability via data persistence and replication.\\\\\\\\nBecause functions are part of the database and therefore declared before use, applications aren\\'t required to load them during runtime nor risk aborted transactions.\\\\\\\\nAn application that uses functions depends only on their APIs rather than on the embedded script logic in the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhereas ephemeral scripts are considered a part of the application\\'s domain, functions extend the database server itself with user-provided logic.\\\\\\\\nThey can be used to expose a richer API composed of core Redis commands, similar to modules, developed once, loaded at startup, and used repeatedly by various applications / clients.\\\\\\\\nEvery function has a unique user-defined name, making it much easier to call and trace its execution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe design of Redis Functions also attempts to demarcate between the programming language used for writing functions and their management by the server.\\\\\\\\nLua, the only language interpreter that Redis presently support as an embedded execution engine, is meant to be simple and easy to learn.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the choice of Lua as a language still presents many Redis users with a challenge.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Functions feature makes no assumptions about the implementation\\'s language.\\\\\\\\nAn execution engine that is part of the definition of the function handles running it.\\\\\\\\nAn engine can theoretically execute functions in any language as long as it respects several rules (such as the ability to terminate an executing function).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPresently, as noted above, Redis ships with a single embedded [Lua 5.1]() engine.\\\\\\\\nThere are plans to support additional engines in the future.\\\\\\\\nRedis functions can use all of Lua\\'s available capabilities to ephemeral scripts,\\\\\\\\nwith the only exception being the [Redis Lua scripts debugger]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions also simplify development by enabling code sharing.\\\\\\\\nEvery function belongs to a single library, and any given library can consist of multiple functions.\\\\\\\\nThe library\\'s contents are immutable, and selective updates of its functions aren\\'t allowed.\\\\\\\\nInstead, libraries are updated as a whole with all of their functions together in one operation.\\\\\\\\nThis allows calling functions from other functions within the same library, or sharing code between functions by using a common code in library-internal methods, that can also take language native arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions are intended to better support the use case of maintaining a consistent view for data entities through a logical schema, as mentioned above.\\\\\\\\nAs such, functions are stored alongside the data itself.\\\\\\\\nFunctions are also persisted to the AOF file and replicated from master to replicas, so they are as durable as the data itself.\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis is used as an ephemeral cache, additional mechanisms (described below) are required to make functions more durable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLike all other operations in Redis, the execution of a function is atomic.\\\\\\\\nA function\\'s execution blocks all server activities during its entire time, similarly to the semantics of [transactions]().\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\nThe blocking semantics of an executed function apply to all connected clients at all times.\\\\\\\\nBecause running a function blocks the Redis server, functions are meant to finish executing quickly, so you should avoid using long-running functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n

semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripting offers several properties that can be valuable in many cases.\\\\\\\\nThese include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Providing locality by executing logic where data lives. Data locality reduces overall latency and saves networking resources.\\\\\\\\n* Blocking semantics that ensure the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\n* Enabling the composition of simple capabilities that are either missing from Redis or are too niche to be a part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLua lets you run part of your application logic inside Redis.\\\\\\\\nSuch scripts can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine.\\\\\\\\nPresently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference]() page for complete documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough the server executes them, Eval scripts are regarded as a part of the client-side application, which is why they\\'re not named, versioned, or persisted.\\\\\\\\nSo all scripts may need to be reloaded by the application at any time if missing (after a server restart, fail-over to a replica, etc.).\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, [Redis Functions]() offer an alternative approach to programmability which allow the server itself to be extended with additional programmed logic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll start scripting with Redis by using the [`EVAL`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s our first example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello, scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, [`EVAL`]() takes two arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe first argument is a string that consists of the script\\'s Lua source code.\\\\\\\\nThe script doesn\\'t need to include any definitions of Lua function.\\\\\\\\nIt is just a Lua program that will run in the Redis engine\\'s context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second argument is the number of arguments that follow the script\\'s body, starting from the third argument, representing Redis key names.\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we used the value _0_ because we didn\\'t provide the script with any arguments, whether the names of keys or not.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.4927,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with Redis 3.2, it is possible to select an alternative replication method.\\\\\\\\nInstead of replicating whole scripts, we can replicate the write commands generated by the script.\\\\\\\\nWe call this **script effects replication**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:**\\\\\\\\nstarting with Redis 5.0, script effects replication is the default mode and does not need to be explicitly enabled.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this replication mode, while Lua scripts are executed, Redis collects all the commands executed by the Lua scripting engine that actually modify the dataset.\\\\\\\\nWhen the script execution finishes, the sequence of commands that the script generated are wrapped into a [`MULTI`]()/[`EXEC`]() [transaction]() and are sent to the replicas and AOF.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is useful in several ways depending on the use case:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When the script is slow to compute, but the effects can be summarized by a few write commands, it is a shame to re-compute the script on the replicas or when reloading the AOF.\\\\\\\\n  In this case, it is much better to replicate just the effects of the script.\\\\\\\\n* When script effects replication is enabled, the restrictions on non-deterministic functions are removed.\\\\\\\\n  You can, for example, use the [`TIME`]() or [`SRANDMEMBER`]() commands inside your scripts freely at any place.\\\\\\\\n* The Lua PRNG in this mode is seeded randomly on every call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnless already enabled by the server\\'s configuration or defaults (before Redis 7.0), you need to issue the following Lua command before the script performs a write:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.replicate_commands()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`redis.replicate_commands()`]() function returns _true) if script effects replication was enabled;\\\\\\\\notherwise, if the function was called after the script already called a write command,\\\\\\\\nit returns _false_, and normal whole script replication is used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis function is deprecated as of Redis 7.0, and while you can still call it, it will always succeed.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\":

executed on the server. This feature, which became available in Redis 7, supersedes the use of [EVAL]() in prior versions of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior versions of Redis made scripting available only via the [`EVAL`]() command, which allows a Lua script to be sent for execution by the server.\\\\\\\\nThe core use cases for [Eval Scripts]() is executing part of your application logic inside Redis, efficiently and atomically.\\\\\\\\nSuch script can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing [`EVAL`]() requires that the application sends the entire script for execution every time.\\\\\\\\nBecause this results in network and script compilation overheads, Redis provides an optimization in the form of the [`EVALSHA`]() command. By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes

be\\\\\\\\nused in order to make the task of writing complex Redis scripts much simpler.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Lua debugger, codenamed LDB, has the following important features:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It uses a server-client model, so it\\'s a remote debugger.\\\\\\\\nThe Redis server acts as the debugging server, while the default client is `redis-cli`. \\\\\\\\nHowever other clients can be developed by following the simple protocol implemented by the server.\\\\\\\\n* By default every new debugging session is a forked session.\\\\\\\\nIt means that while the Redis Lua script is being debugged, the server does not block and is usable for development or in order to execute multiple debugging sessions in parallel.\\\\\\\\nThis also means that changes are **rolled back** after the script debugging session finished, so that\\'s possible to restart a new debugging session again, using exactly the same Redis data set as the previous debugging session.\\\\\\\\n* An alternative synchronous (non forked) debugging model is available on demand, so that changes to the dataset can be retained.\\\\\\\\nIn this mode the server blocks for the time the debugging session is active.\\\\\\\\n* Support for step by step execution.\\\\\\\\n* Support for static and dynamic breakpoints.\\\\\\\\n* Support from logging the debugged script into the debugger console.\\\\\\\\n* Inspection of Lua variables.\\\\\\\\n* Tracing of Redis commands executed by the script.\\\\\\\\n* Pretty printing of Redis and Lua values.\\\\\\\\n* Infinite loops and long execution detection, which simulates a breakpoint.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.3362,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

a given Redis command and returns its reply.\\\\\\\\nIts inputs are the command and arguments, and once called, it executes the command in Redis and returns the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, we can call the [`ECHO`]() command from a script and return its reply like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nreturn redis.call(\\'ECHO\\', \\'Echo, echo... eco... o...\\')\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf and when `redis.call()` triggers a runtime exception, the raw exception is raised back to the user as an error, automatically.\\\\\\\\nTherefore, attempting to execute the following ephemeral script will fail and generate a runtime exception because [`ECHO`]() accepts exactly one argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'ECHO\\', \\'Echo,\\', \\'echo... \\', \\'eco... \\', \\'o...\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n(error) ERR Wrong number of args calling Redis command from script script:

flags](#script_flags)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo handle Redis runtime errors use `redis.pcall()` instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Since version: 2.6.0\\\\\\\\n* Available in scripts: yes\\\\\\\\n* Available in functions: yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis function enables handling runtime errors raised by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThe `redis.pcall()` function  behaves exactly like [`redis.call()`](#redis.call), except that it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Always returns a reply.\\\\\\\\n* Never throws a runtime exception, and returns in its stead a [`redis.error_reply`](#redis.error_reply) in case that a runtime exception is thrown by the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following demonstrates how to use `redis.pcall()` to intercept and handle runtime exceptions from within the context of an ephemeral script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nlocal reply = redis.pcall(\\'ECHO\\', unpack(ARGV))\\\\\\\\nif reply[\\'err\\'] ~= nil then\\\\\\\\n  -- Handle the error sometime, but for now just log it\\\\\\\\n  redis.log(redis.LOG_WARNING, reply[\\'err\\'])\\\\\\\\n  reply[\\'err\\'] = \\'ERR Something is wrong, but no worries, everything is under control\\'\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\nreturn reply\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvaluating this script with more than one argument will return:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 hello

to benchmark Redis performance:\n\n## Primary Tool: redis-benchmark\n\nRedis includes a built-in utility called `redis-benchmark` that simulates running commands by N clients sending M total queries (similar to Apache's `ab` utility).\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -q -n 100000\n```\n\n### Key Options\n\n- `-h <hostname>` - Server hostname (default 127.0.0.1)\n- `-p <port>` - Server port (default 6379)\n- `-c <clients>` - Number of parallel connections (default 50)\n- `-n <requests>` - Total number of requests (default 100000)\n- `-d <size>` - Data size of SET/GET value in bytes (default 3)\n- `-t <tests>` - Only run specific tests (comma-separated)\n- `-P <numreq>` - Pipeline requests (default 1, no pipeline)\n- `-q` - Quiet mode, just show query/sec values\n- `--threads <num>` - Enable multi-thread mode\n\n### Example: Test Specific Commands\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -t set,lpush -n 100000 -q\n```\n\n### Example: Using Pipelining (Higher Throughput)\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\n```\n\nPipelining can dramatically improve performance (e.g., from ~72K to 1.5M+ requests/sec for SET operations).\n\n##

In Redis the difference\\\\\\\\nbetween such a synthetic benchmark and a real one is not huge since it is an\\\\\\\\nin-memory system, however it is possible to stress cache misses and in general\\\\\\\\nto simulate a more real-world work load by using a large key space.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is obtained by using the `-r` switch. For instance if I want to run\\\\\\\\none million SET operations, using a random key for every operation out of\\\\\\\\n100k possible keys, I\\'ll use the following command line:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli flushall\\\\\\\\n    OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -t set -r 100000 -n 1000000\\\\\\\\n    ====== SET ======\\\\\\\\n      1000000 requests completed in 13.86 seconds\\\\\\\\n      50 parallel clients\\\\\\\\n      3 bytes payload\\\\\\\\n      keep alive: 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    99.76% `<=` 1 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    99.98% `<=` 2 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    72144.87 requests per second\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli dbsize\\\\\\\\n    (integer) 99993\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default every client (the benchmark simulates 50 clients if not otherwise\\\\\\\\nspecified with `-c`) sends the next command only when the reply of the previous\\\\\\\\ncommand is received, this means that the server will likely need a read call\\\\\\\\nin order to read each command from every client. Also RTT is paid as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis supports [pipelining](/topics/pipelining), so it is possible to send\\\\\\\\nmultiple commands at once, a feature often exploited by real world applications.\\\\\\\\nRedis pipelining is able to dramatically improve the number of operations per\\\\\\\\nsecond a server is able to deliver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of running the benchmark in a MacBook Air 11\\\\\\\\\\\\\" using a\\\\\\\\npipelining of 16 commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\\\\\\\\n    SET: 1536098.25 requests per second, p50=0.479 msec                     \\\\\\\\n    GET: 1811594.25 requests per second, p50=0.391 msec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining results in a significant increase in performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPitfalls and misconceptions\\\\\\\\n---------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first point is obvious: the golden rule of a useful benchmark is to\\\\\\\\nonly compare apples and apples. Different versions of Redis can be compared\\\\\\\\non the same workload for instance. Or the same version of Redis, but with\\\\\\\\ndifferent options. If you plan to compare Redis to something else, then it is\\\\\\\\nimportant to evaluate the functional and technical differences, and take them\\\\\\\\nin account.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is a server, hence, all commands involve network round trips. Embedded data stores do not involve network and protocol management. When comparing such products to Redis, command execution times should be used instead of end-to-end times.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis commands return an acknowledgment for all usual commands. Some other data stores do not. Comparing Redis to stores involving one-way queries is only mildly useful.\\\\\\\\n+ Naively iterating on synchronous Redis commands does not benchmark Redis itself, but rather measure your network (or IPC) latency and the client library intrinsic latency. To really test Redis, you need multiple connections (like redis-benchmark) and/or to use pipelining to aggregate several commands and/or multiple threads or processes.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is an in-memory data store with some optional persistence options. If you plan to compare it to transactional servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc ...), then you should consider activating AOF and decide on a suitable fsync policy.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is, mostly, a single-threaded server from the POV of commands execution (actually modern versions of Redis use threads for different things). It is not designed to benefit from multiple CPU cores. People are supposed to launch several Redis instances to scale out on several cores if needed. It is not really fair to compare one single Redis instance to a multi-threaded data store.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA common misconception is that redis-benchmark is designed to make Redis\\\\\\\\nperformances look stellar, the throughput achieved by redis-benchmark being\\\\\\\\nsomewhat artificial, and not achievable by a real application. This is\\\\\\\\nactually not true.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `redis-benchmark` program is a quick and useful way to get some figures and\\\\\\\\nevaluate the performance of a Redis instance on a given hardware. However,\\\\\\\\nby default, it does not represent the maximum throughput a Redis instance can\\\\\\\\nsustain. Actually, by using pipelining and a fast client (hiredis), it is fairly\\\\\\\\neasy to write a program generating more throughput than redis-benchmark. The\\\\\\\\ndefault behavior of redis-benchmark is to achieve throughput by exploiting\\\\\\\\nconcurrency only (i.e. it creates several connections to the server).\\\\\\\\nIt does not use pipelining or any parallelism at all (one pending query per\\\\\\\\nconnection at most, and no multi-threading), if not explicitly enabled via\\\\\\\\nthe `-P` parameter. So in some way using `redis-benchmark` and, triggering, for\\\\\\\\nexample, a `BGSAVE` operation in the background at the same time, will provide\\\\\\\\nthe user with numbers more near to the *worst case* than to the best case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo run a benchmark using pipelining mode (and achieve higher throughput),\\\\\\\\nyou need to explicitly use the -P option. Please note that it is still a\\\\\\\\nrealistic behavior since a lot of Redis based applications actively use\\\\\\\\npipelining to improve performance. However you should use a pipeline size that\\\\\\\\nis more or less the average pipeline length you\\'ll be able to use in your\\\\\\\\napplication in order to get realistic numbers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, the benchmark should apply the same operations, and work in the same way\\\\\\\\nwith the multiple data stores you want to compare. It is absolutely pointless to\\\\\\\\ncompare the result of redis-benchmark to the result of another benchmark\\\\\\\\nprogram and extrapolate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, Redis and memcached in single-threaded mode can be compared on\\\\\\\\nGET/SET operations. Both are in-memory data stores, working mostly in the same\\\\\\\\nway at the protocol level. Provided their respective benchmark application is\\\\\\\\naggregating queries in the same way (pipelining) and use a similar number of\\\\\\\\nconnections, the comparison is actually meaningful.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis perfect example is illustrated by the dialog between Redis (antirez) and\\\\\\\\nmemcached (dormando) developers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 1 - On Redis, Memcached, Speed, Benchmarks and The Toilet](http://antirez.com/post/redis-memcached-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[dormando - Redis VS Memcached (slightly better bench)](http://dormando.livejournal.com/525147.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 2 - An update on the Memcached/Redis benchmark](http://antirez.com/post/update-on-memcached-redis-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can see that in the end, the difference between the two solutions is not\\\\\\\\nso staggering, once all technical aspects are considered. Please note both\\\\\\\\nRedis and memcached have been optimized further after these benchmarks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, when very efficient servers are benchmarked (and stores like Redis\\\\\\\\nor memcached definitely fall in this category), it may be difficult to saturate\\\\\\\\nthe server. Sometimes, the performance bottleneck is on client side,\\\\\\\\nand not server-side. In that case, the client (i.e. the benchmark program itself)\\\\\\\\nmust be fixed, or perhaps scaled out, in order to reach the maximum throughput.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFactors impacting Redis performance\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are multiple factors having direct consequences on Redis performance.\\\\\\\\nWe mention them here, since they can alter the result of any benchmarks.\\\\\\\\nPlease note however, that a typical Redis instance running on a low end,\\\\\\\\nuntuned box usually provides good enough performance for most applications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Network bandwidth and latency usually have a direct impact on the performance.\\\\\\\\nIt is a good practice to use the ping program to quickly check the latency\\\\\\\\nbetween the client and server hosts is normal before launching the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nRegarding the bandwidth, it is generally useful to estimate\\\\\\\\nthe throughput in Gbit/s and compare it to the theoretical bandwidth\\\\\\\\nof the network. For instance a benchmark setting 4 KB strings\\\\\\\\nin Redis at 100000 q/s, would actually consume 3.2 Gbit/s of bandwidth\\\\\\\\nand probably fit within a 10 Gbit/s link, but not a 1 Gbit/s one. In many real\\\\\\\\nworld scenarios, Redis throughput is limited by the network well before being\\\\\\\\nlimited by the CPU. To consolidate several high-throughput Redis instances\\\\\\\\non a single server, it worth considering putting a 10 Gbit/s NIC\\\\\\\\nor multiple 1 Gbit/s NICs with TCP/IP bonding.\\\\\\\\n+ CPU is another very important factor. Being single-threaded, Redis favors\\\\\\\\nfast CPUs with large caches and not many cores. At this game, Intel CPUs are\\\\\\\\ncurrently the winners. It is not uncommon to get only half the performance on\\\\\\\\nan AMD Opteron CPU compared to similar Nehalem EP/Westmere EP/Sandy Bridge\\\\\\\\nIntel CPUs with Redis. When client and server run on the same box, the CPU is\\\\\\\\nthe limiting factor with redis-benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ Speed of RAM and memory bandwidth seem less critical for global performance\\\\\\\\nespecially for small objects. For large objects (>10 KB), it may become\\\\\\\\nnoticeable though. Usually, it is not really cost-effective to buy expensive\\\\\\\\nfast memory modules to optimize Redis.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis runs slower on a VM compared to running without virtualization using\\\\\\\\nthe same hardware. If you have the chance to run Redis on a physical machine\\\\\\\\nthis is preferred. However this does not mean that Redis is slow in\\\\\\\\nvirtualized environments, the delivered performances are still very good\\\\\\\\nand most of the serious performance issues you may incur in virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironments are due to over-provisioning, non-local disks with high latency,\\\\\\\\nor old hypervisor software that have slow `fork` syscall implementation.\\\\\\\\n+ When the server and client benchmark programs run on the same box, both\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback and unix domain sockets can be used. Depending on the\\\\\\\\nplatform, unix domain sockets can achieve around 50% more throughput than\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback (on Linux for instance). The default behavior of\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark is to use the TCP/IP loopback.\\\\\\\\n+ The performance benefit of unix domain sockets compared to TCP/IP loopback\\\\\\\\ntends to decrease when pipelining is heavily used (i.e. long pipelines).\\\\\\\\n+ When an ethernet network is used to access Redis, aggregating commands using\\\\\\\\npipelining is especially efficient when the size of the data is kept under\\\\\\\\nthe ethernet packet size (about 1500 bytes). Actually, processing 10 bytes,\\\\\\\\n100 bytes, or 1000 bytes queries almost result in the same throughput.\\\\\\\\nSee the graph below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Data size impact](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/client_command/topics/Data_size.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ On multi CPU sockets servers, Redis performance becomes dependent on the\\\\\\\\nNUMA configuration and process location. The most visible effect is that\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark results seem non-deterministic because client and server\\\\\\\\nprocesses are distributed randomly on the cores. To get deterministic results,\\\\\\\\nit is required to use process placement tools (on Linux: taskset or numactl).\\\\\\\\nThe most efficient combination is always to put the client and server on two\\\\\\\\ndifferent cores of the same CPU to benefit from the L3 cache.\\\\\\\\nHere are some results of 4 KB SET benchmark for 3 server CPUs (AMD Istanbul,\\\\\\\\nIntel Nehalem EX, and Intel Westmere) with different relative placements.\\\\\\\\nPlease note this benchmark is not meant to compare CPU models between themselves\\\\\\\\n(CPUs exact model and frequency are therefore not disclosed).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![NUMA chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/6374a07f93e867353e5e946c1e39a573dfc83f6c/topics/NUMA_chart.gif)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, the number of client connections is also an\\\\\\\\nimportant factor. Being based on epoll/kqueue, the Redis event loop is quite\\\\\\\\nscalable. Redis has already been benchmarked at more than 60000 connections,\\\\\\\\nand was still able to sustain 50000 q/s in these conditions. As a rule of thumb,\\\\\\\\nan instance with 30000 connections can only process half the throughput\\\\\\\\nachievable with 100 connections. Here is an example showing the throughput of\\\\\\\\na Redis instance per number of connections:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![connections chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/system_info/topics/Connections_chart.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, it is possible to achieve higher throughput by\\\\\\\\ntuning the NIC(s) configuration and associated interruptions. Best throughput\\\\\\\\nis achieved by setting an affinity between Rx/Tx NIC queues and CPU cores,\\\\\\\\nand activating RPS (Receive Packet Steering) support. More information in this\\\\\\\\n[thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/gUhc19gnYgc/BruTPCOroiMJ).\\\\\\\\nJumbo frames may also provide a performance boost when large objects are used.\\\\\\\\n+ Depending on the platform, Redis can be compiled against different memory\\\\\\\\nallocators (libc malloc, jemalloc, tcmalloc), which may have different behaviors\\\\\\\\nin term of raw speed, internal and external fragmentation.\\\\\\\\nIf you did not compile Redis yourself, you can use the INFO command to check\\\\\\\\nthe `mem_allocator` field. Please note most benchmarks do not run long enough to\\\\\\\\ngenerate significant external fragmentation (contrary to production Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOther things to consider\\\\\\\\n------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne important goal of any benchmark is to get reproducible results, so they\\\\\\\\ncan be compared to the results of other tests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ A good practice is to try to run tests on isolated hardware as much as possible.\\\\\\\\nIf it is not possible, then the system must be monitored to check the benchmark\\\\\\\\nis not impacted by some external activity.\\\\\\\\n+ Some configurations (desktops and laptops for sure, some servers as well)\\\\\\\\nhave a variable CPU core frequency mechanism. The policy controlling this\\\\\\\\nmechanism can be set at the OS level. Some CPU models are more aggressive than\\\\\\\\nothers at adapting the frequency of the CPU cores to the workload. To get\\\\\\\\nreproducible results, it is better to set the highest possible fixed frequency\\\\\\\\nfor all the CPU cores involved in the benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ An important point is to size the system accordingly to the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nThe system must have enough RAM and must not swap. On Linux, do not forget\\\\\\\\nto set the `overcommit_memory` parameter correctly. Please note 32 and 64 bit\\\\\\\\nRedis instances do not have the same memory footprint.\\\\\\\\n+ If you plan to use RDB or AOF for your benchmark, please check there is no other\\\\\\\\nI/O activity in the system. Avoid putting RDB or AOF files on NAS or NFS shares,\\\\\\\\nor on any other devices impacting your network bandwidth and/or latency\\\\\\\\n(for instance, EBS on Amazon EC2).\\\\\\\\n+ Set Redis logging level (loglevel parameter) to warning or notice. Avoid putting\\\\\\\\nthe generated log file on a remote filesystem.\\\\\\\\n+ Avoid using monitoring tools which can alter the result of the benchmark. For\\\\\\\\ninstance using INFO at regular interval to gather statistics is probably fine,\\\\\\\\nbut MONITOR will impact the measured performance significantly.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5715,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/arm.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ARM support\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance testing of Redis was performed on the Raspberry Pi 3 and Pi 1 model B.

It then returns the top K items with the smallest distances to the query vector. These are the most semantically similar items.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow construct a query to do just that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nquery = (\\\\\\\\n    Query(\\'(*)=>[KNN 3 @vector $query_vector AS vector_score]\\')\\\\\\\\n     .sort_by(\\'vector_score\\')\\\\\\\\n     .return_fields(\\'vector_score\\', \\'id\\', \\'brand\\', \\'model\\', \\'description\\')\\\\\\\\n     .dialect(2)\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s break down the above query template:\\\\\\\\n- The filter expression `(*)` means `all`. In other words, no filtering was applied. You could replace it with an expression that filters by additional metadata.\\\\\\\\n- The `KNN` part of the query searches for the top 3 nearest neighbors.\\\\\\\\n- The query vector must be passed in as the param `query_vector`.\\\\\\\\n- The distance to the query vector is returned as `vector_score`.\\\\\\\\n- The results are sorted by this `vector_score`.\\\\\\\\n- Finally, it returns the fields `vector_score`,  `id`, `brand`, `model`, and `description` for each result.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo utilize a vector query with the [`FT.SEARCH`]() command, you must specify DIALECT 2 or greater.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou must pass the vectorized query as a byte array with the param name `query_vector`. The following code creates a Python NumPy array from the query vector and converts it into a compact, byte-level representation that can be passed as a parameter to the query:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nfor i, encoded_query in enumerate(encoded_queries):\\\\\\\\n    result = client.ft(\\'idx:bikes_vss\\').search(\\\\\\\\n        query,\\\\\\\\n        {\\\\\\\\n          \\'query_vector\\': np.array(encoded_query, dtype=np.float32).tobytes()\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n    )\\\\\\\\n    print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Results for query \\'{queries[i]}\\':\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n    for doc in result.docs:\\\\\\\\n        print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t{doc.id}: {doc.brand} {doc.model}\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the template for the query in place, you can execute all queries in a loop. Notice that the script calculates the `vector_score` for each result as `1 - doc.vector_score`. Because the cosine distance is used as the metric, the items with the smallest distance are closer and, therefore, more similar to the query.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, loop over the matched documents and create a list of results that can be converted into a Pandas table to visualize the results:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe query results show the individual queries\\' top three matches (our K parameter) along with the bike\\'s id, brand, and model for each query.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, for the query \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Best Mountain bikes for kids\\\\\\\\\\\\\", the highest similarity score (`0.54`) and, therefore the closest match was the \\'Nord\\' brand \\'Chook air 5\\' bike model, described as:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> The Chook Air 5 gives kids aged six years and older a durable and uberlight mountain bike for their first experience on tracks and easy cruising through forests and fields.

This setup requires no external API dependencies.\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n```bash\n# Install Ollama\n# Download from https://ollama.com/download\n\n# Pull Llama 3.2 model\nollama pull llama3.2\n\n# Pull embedding model\nollama pull openhermes\n```\n\n### 2. Set Up Vector Database\n```bash\n# Install and run Qdrant locally\ndocker pull qdrant/qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\n### 3. Install Dependencies\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent\n\n# Install requirements\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 4. Run the Application\n```bash\npython local_rag_agent.py\n```\n\nAccess the web interface at `http://localhost:7777` through the AgentOS interface.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Fully local implementation** - No external API calls\n- **Llama 3.2** via Ollama for text generation\n- **Qdrant** for vector search\n- **Agno v2.0 Knowledge class** for document management\n- **Interactive web UI** through AgentOS\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Documents (e.g., PDFs) are loaded into the knowledge base on first run\n2. Content is chunked and embedded using the local embedding model\n3. Embeddings are stored in Qdrant vector database\n4. User queries are embedded and searched against the knowledge base\n5.

steps）\n- **右侧面板**：最终答案和来源引用\n- 用户可以清晰看到从查询到答案的完整 RAG 过程\n\n### 3. 智能查询处理流程\n\n```\n用户查询 \n  ↓\n查询重写（Query Rewriting）\n  ↓\n向量检索（Vector Search + Semantic Matching）\n  ↓\n相似度阈值过滤\n  ↓\n自动降级到 Web 搜索（如果文档不相关）\n  ↓\n推理生成（Reasoning + Response Generation）\n  ↓\n来源归因（Source Attribution）\n```\n\n### 4. 关键技术栈\n\n**推理层**：\n- Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking / Deepseek R1（推理模型）\n- Agno v2.0 框架（Agent 编排）\n- ReasoningTools（逐步分析）\n\n**检索层**：\n- OpenAI Embeddings / Snowflake Arctic（向量编码）\n- Qdrant / LanceDB（向量存储）\n- 相似度阈值过滤（threshold filtering）\n\n**增强层**：\n- Exa AI（Web 搜索降级）\n- 自定义域名过滤\n- 上下文感知生成\n\n### 5. 实现示例\n\n```python\n# 核心流程（基于 Agno 框架）\nagent = Agent(\n    model=Gemini(\"gemini-2.5-flash\"),\n    tools=[ReasoningTools()],\n    knowledge=Knowledge(\n        vector_db=LanceDB(),\n        embedder=OpenAIEmbedder()\n    ),\n    show_tool_calls=True,  # 展示推理过程\n    markdown=True\n)\n\n# 流式输出推理步骤\nfor event in agent.run(query, stream=True):\n    if event.event == \"reasoning\":\n        display_reasoning(event.content)\n    elif event.event == \"response\":\n        display_answer(event.content)\n```\n\n### 6. 推理能力的关键特性\n\n- **逐步思考**：Agent 将复杂问题分解为多个推理步骤\n- **工具调用可见性**：Debug 模式展示每次工具调用和执行流程\n- **上下文感知**：基于检索到的文档进行推理，而非通用知识\n- **来源追溯**：每个推理步骤都标注信息来源\n- **自动降级**：文档不足时自动切换到 Web 搜索\n\n## 最佳实践\n\n1. **选择支持推理的模型**：Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking、Deepseek R1、Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n2. **启用流式输出**：让用户看到推理过程，增强可信度\n3. **设置相似度阈值**：避免不相关文档干扰推理\n4. **集成 Web 搜索降级**：知识库不足时自动扩展信息源\n5. **记录完整推理链**：便于调试和评估推理质量\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/agentic_rag_with_reasoning/README.md > How

It enables you to ask questions about images, diagrams, charts, and PDF pages using natural language.\n\n### How It Works\n\nVision RAG follows a two-stage process:\n\n**1. Retrieval Stage:**\n- Images (or PDF pages) are converted to base64 strings\n- A multimodal embedding model (like Cohere Embed-4) generates vector embeddings for each image\n- When you ask a text question, it's embedded using the same model\n- Cosine similarity finds the most relevant image for your query\n\n**2. Generation Stage:**\n- The retrieved image and your question are passed to a vision-capable LLM (like Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)\n- The model analyzes the image content and generates a text answer based on what it sees\n\n### Key Capabilities\n\n- **No OCR Required**: Directly processes complex images and visual elements without separate text extraction\n- **PDF Support**: Automatically extracts PDF pages as images for analysis\n- **Multimodal Search**: Finds semantically relevant images based on text queries\n- **Flexible Content**: Works with charts, diagrams, infographics, screenshots, and document pages\n\n### Implementation Example\n\nThe knowledge base contains a complete Vision RAG implementation using:\n- **Cohere Embed-4** (`embed-v4.0`) for multimodal embeddings\n- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** for visual question answering\n- **Streamlit** for the interactive UI\n\nSetup steps:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/vision_rag\npip install -r requirements.txt\nstreamlit run vision_rag.py\n```\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Analyze financial charts and extract key figures or trends\n- Answer questions about diagrams, flowcharts, or infographics\n- Extract information from tables or text within screenshots\n- Build visual knowledge bases queryable with natural language\n- Process multi-page reports and complex visual documents\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/vision_rag/README.md > Vision RAG with Cohere Embed-4 🖼️]", "tools_used":

Answering**: Employs Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to analyze the content of the retrieved image/page and generate accurate, context-aware answers.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexible Content Sources**: \\\\\\\\n    - Use pre-loaded sample financial charts and infographics.\\\\\\\\n    - Upload your own custom images (PNG, JPG, JPEG).\\\\\\\\n    - **Upload PDF documents**: Automatically extracts pages as images for analysis.\\\\\\\\n- **No OCR Required**: Directly processes complex images and visual elements within PDF pages without needing separate text extraction steps.\\\\\\\\n- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction, including content loading, question input, and result display.\\\\\\\\n- **Session Management**: Remembers loaded/uploaded content (images and processed PDF pages) within a session.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Python 3.8+\\\\\\\\n- Cohere API key\\\\\\\\n- Google Gemini API key\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow these steps to set up and run the application:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

 ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Install Dependencies**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n    *(Ensure you have the latest `PyMuPDF` installed along with other requirements)*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3.  **Set up your API keys**:\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Cohere API key from: [https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Google API key from: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4.  **Run the Streamlit app**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    streamlit run vision_rag.py\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5.  **Access the Web Interface**:\\\\\\\\n    - Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your terminal.\\\\\\\\n    - Open this URL in your web browser.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe application follows a two-stage RAG process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Retrieval**: \\\\\\\\n    - When you load sample images or upload your own images/PDFs:\\\\\\\\n        - Regular images are converted to base64 strings.\\\\\\\\n        - **PDFs are processed page by page**: Each page is rendered as an image, saved temporarily, and converted to a base64 string.\\\\\\\\n    - Cohere\\'s `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_document\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`) is used to generate a dense vector embedding for each image or PDF page image.\\\\\\\\n    - When you ask a question, the text query is embedded using the same `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_query\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`).\\\\\\\\n    - Cosine similarity is calculated between the question embedding and all image embeddings.\\\\\\\\n    - The image with the highest similarity score (which could be a regular image or a specific PDF page image) is retrieved as the most relevant context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Generation**:\\\\\\\\n    - The original text question and the retrieved image/page image are passed as input to the Google `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model.\\\\\\\\n    - Gemini analyzes the image content in the context of the question and generates a textual answer.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\":

**Set up a Vector Database**: Configure a vector store like Redis or Qdrant to handle vector data and embeddings.\n\n2. **Use LangChain Integration**: LangChain provides built-in integrations with vector stores:\n   - For Redis: Use [LangChain's Redis integration](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/)\n   - For Qdrant: LangChain supports Qdrant as a vector store\n\n3. **Embed and Store Data**:\n   - Convert your documents into vector embeddings using models like BERT, GPT, or Google's embedding-001\n   - Use document loaders like `WebBaseLoader` to fetch content\n   - Split documents using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`\n   - Store embeddings in your vector database\n\n4. **Build the RAG Pipeline**:\n   - Implement query logic to retrieve relevant vectors based on input prompts\n   - Feed retrieved context into a generative model (GPT, Gemini, etc.)\n   - The model uses the retrieved information to generate augmented responses\n\n5. **Orchestration**: LangChain handles the orchestration of the retrieval-augmented generation process, ensuring relevant information is retrieved and presented.\n\n## Example Implementation\n\nThe

Redis for RAG\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To build a RAG application with Redis, follow these general steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Set up Redis**: Start by setting up a Redis instance and configuring it to handle vector data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Use a Framework**:\\\\\\\\n    1. **Redis Vector Library (RedisVL)**: [RedisVL](https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redisvl/) enhances the development of generative AI applications by efficiently managing vectors and metadata. It allows for storage of vector embeddings and facilitates fast similarity searches, crucial for retrieving relevant information in RAG.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Popular AI frameworks**: Redis integrates seamlessly with various AI frameworks and tools. For instance, combining Redis with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) or [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/RedisIndexDemo/), libraries for building language models, enables developers to create sophisticated RAG pipelines. These integrations support efficient data management and building real-time LLM chains.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Spring AI and Redis**: Using [Spring AI with Redis](https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/) simplifies building RAG applications. Spring AI provides a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into applications, while Redis handles data management, ensuring the RAG pipeline is efficient and scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Embed and store data**: Convert your data into vector embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., BERT, GPT). Store these embeddings in Redis, where they can be quickly retrieved based on vector searches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Integrate with a generative model**: Use a generative AI model that can leverage the retrieved data. The model will use the vectors stored in Redis to augment its generation process, ensuring the output is informed by relevant, up-to-date information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Query and generate**: Implement the query logic to retrieve relevant vectors from Redis based on the input prompt. Feed these vectors into the generative model to produce augmented outputs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency**: The in-memory data store of Redis ensures that retrieval operations are performed with minimal latency.\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability**: Redis scales horizontally, seamlessly handling growing volumes of data and queries.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures and integrates with AI frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, Redis offers a powerful and efficient platform for implementing RAG. Its vector management capabilities, high performance, and seamless integration with AI frameworks make it an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI applications with real-time data retrieval.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.329,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3c75fde5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3c75fde5-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/rag_agent_cohere/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG Agent with Cohere ⌘R\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG Agent with Cohere ⌘R\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A RAG Agentic system built with Cohere\\'s new model Command-r7b-12-2024, Qdrant for vector storage, Langchain for RAG and LangGraph for orchestration.

Use pre-loaded sample financial charts and infographics.\\\\\\\\n    - Upload your own custom images (PNG, JPG, JPEG).\\\\\\\\n    - **Upload PDF documents**: Automatically extracts pages as images for analysis.\\\\\\\\n- **No OCR Required**: Directly processes complex images and visual elements within PDF pages without needing separate text extraction steps.\\\\\\\\n- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction, including content loading, question input, and result display.\\\\\\\\n- **Session Management**: Remembers loaded/uploaded content (images and processed PDF pages) within a session.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Python 3.8+\\\\\\\\n- Cohere API key\\\\\\\\n- Google Gemini API key\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow these steps to set up and run the application:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Clone and Navigate to Directory** :\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\\\\\\\\n    cd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/vision_rag\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Install Dependencies**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n    *(Ensure you have the latest `PyMuPDF` installed along with other requirements)*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3.  **Set up your API keys**:\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Cohere API key from: [https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Google API key from: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4.  **Run the Streamlit app**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    streamlit run vision_rag.py\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5.  **Access the Web Interface**:\\\\\\\\n    - Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your terminal.\\\\\\\\n    - Open this URL in your web browser.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe application follows a two-stage RAG process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Retrieval**: \\\\\\\\n    - When you load sample images or upload your own images/PDFs:\\\\\\\\n        - Regular images are converted to base64 strings.\\\\\\\\n        - **PDFs are processed page by page**: Each page is rendered as an image, saved temporarily, and converted to a base64 string.\\\\\\\\n    - Cohere\\'s `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_document\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`) is used to generate a dense vector embedding for each image or PDF page image.\\\\\\\\n    - When you ask a question, the text query is embedded using the same `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_query\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`).\\\\\\\\n    - Cosine similarity is calculated between the question embedding and all image embeddings.\\\\\\\\n    - The image with the highest similarity score (which could be a regular image or a specific PDF page image) is retrieved as the most relevant context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Generation**:\\\\\\\\n    - The original text question and the retrieved image/page image are passed as input to the Google `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model.\\\\\\\\n    - Gemini analyzes the image content in the context of the question and generates a textual answer.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_cSoKaX8zzfea48FLtvy2iv', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Found relevant documentation!

Here's what I found:\n\n## What is a Streaming AI Chatbot?\n\nA streaming AI chatbot is a conversational AI application that generates responses **token-by-token in real-time** rather than waiting for the complete response. This creates a more natural, interactive user experience where users see the AI's response appear progressively, similar to how a human types.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Real-time AI Streaming**: Token-by-token response generation using OpenAI's streaming API\n- **Live State Management**: Conversation state updates in real-time with message history\n- **Event-driven Architecture**: Clean API → Event → Streaming Response flow\n- **Status Tracking**: Messages have states like `created`, `streaming`, and `completed`\n\n## How to Build One\n\n### Architecture (3 Core Files)\n\n```\nstreaming-ai-chatbot/\n├── steps/\n│   ├── conversation.stream.ts    # Real-time conversation state\n│   ├── chat-api.step.ts         # Simple chat API endpoint  \n│   └── ai-response.step.ts      # Streaming AI response handler\n├── package.json\n├── .env.example\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n1. **Clone and Install**:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_llm_apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/streaming_ai_chatbot\n\nnpm install\n```\n\n2. **Configure OpenAI API**:\n```bash\ncp .env.example .env\n# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key\n```\n\n3. **Start Development Server**:\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n4. **Access the Chatbot**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`\n\n### Core Implementation\n\n**Enable Streaming in OpenAI API**:\n```typescript\nconst stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',\n  messages: [...],\n  stream: true, // Enable

Here's how to do it:\n\n## Fine-tuning Llama 3.2 for a Specific Task\n\nThe knowledge base contains a complete guide using the **Unsloth** library, which makes fine-tuning fast and efficient. You can run this for free on Google Colab.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- Uses **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** for efficient fine-tuning\n- Works with Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models\n- Trains on the FineTome-100k dataset (customizable)\n- Optimized for Google Colab's free tier with GPU access\n\n### Quick Start\n\n1. **Installation**:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n2. **Run the fine-tuning script**:\n```bash\npython finetune_llama3.2.py\n```\n\n3. The fine-tuned model will be saved in the `finetuned_model` directory.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Model Loading**: Loads Llama 3.2 3B Instruct using Unsloth's FastLanguageModel\n2. **LoRA Setup**: Applies Low-Rank Adaptation to specific layers for efficient training\n3. **Data Preparation**: Loads and preprocesses the dataset using a chat template\n4. **Training**: Uses SFTTrainer with configurable training arguments\n5. **Model Saving**: Saves the fine-tuned model to disk\n\n### Customization Options\n\nYou can modify these parameters:\n- `model_name`: Switch to `\"unsloth/Llama-3.1-1B-Instruct\"` for the 1B model\n- `max_seq_length`: Adjust maximum sequence length\n- `r`: LoRA rank parameter\n- Training hyperparameters in `TrainingArguments`\n- Replace the dataset by changing the `load_dataset` function call\n- Adjust `target_modules` in LoRA setup to fine-tune different layers\n- Modify the chat template for different conversational formats\n\n### For Google Colab\n\n1. Open a new Colab notebook\n2. Install dependencies:\n```bash\n!pip install torch transformers datasets trl unsloth\n```\n3. Copy the script and run it\n\n**Note**: The process may take time depending on model size and available GPU resources. Ensure sufficient storage space for the fine-tuned model.\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning/README.md > Notes]\n\nFor a complete step-by-step tutorial with detailed explanations, check the linked guide in the repository.", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/ai_reasoning_agent/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/agentic_rag_embedding_gemma/README.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["fine-tune", "Llama", "training", "RAG"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/ai_reasoning_agent/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/agentic_rag_embedding_gemma/README.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "750f0ff4-2b16-475c-88f8-1ae6c7b8fa72", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "e92cf5a8-3004-4fc3-963c-677dc27c624c", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about fine-tuning Llama 3.2.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_GpKipjmYabLzGnvy3CD43B', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'fine-tune Llama 3.2 for specific task', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_5AIVeanDXXt9bbFYv5nYOx', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'Llama 3\\\\.2|fine-tun(e|ing)'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_GpKipjmYabLzGnvy3CD43B', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.0967,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4b0a5b7b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4b0a5b7b-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Run the entire script\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"1.

Session retrieves conversation history\n2. History prepended to new input\n3. Agent processes with full context\n4. New items stored back to session\n\n[Source: openai_sdk_crash_course/7_sessions/README.md > Tutorial Overview]\n\n### 4. **Fully Local Implementation**\nFor privacy-focused applications using Llama 3.1:\n\n**Stack:**\n- **LLM**: Llama 3.1 via Ollama (local)\n- **Embeddings**: Nomic Embed (local)\n- **Vector Store**: Qdrant (local)\n- **No external API dependencies**\n\n```bash\n# Install Ollama and pull model\nollama pull llama3.1\n\n# Start local Qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\n[Source: local_chatgpt_with_memory/README.md > How to get Started?]\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **User Isolation**: Maintain separate memory spaces per user ID\n2. **Context Retrieval**: Fetch relevant past conversations before generating responses\n3. **Persistent Storage**: Use volume mounts for Qdrant to survive container restarts\n4. **Memory Viewing**: Provide UI for users to view their conversation history\n5. **Multi-LLM Support**: Design memory layer to work across different LLM providers\n\n## Example Use Cases\n- AI Travel Agent with preference memory\n- Personalized chatbots with conversation history\n- Multi-LLM applications with shared memory\n- Research assistants with document memory\n\n[Additional sources: ai_travel_agent_memory/README.md, awesome-llm-apps/README.md]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths":

It depicts the potential of Agno as a team of collaborative agents working together seamlessly in order to address a real-world challenge - analyzing speech presentations by users and providing them with comprehensive evaluation and feedback to improve their public speaking skills. Each individual agent has a clear cut goal to follow and together they coordinate as a team to solve a complex multimodal problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- This project has a huge potential for further enhancements. It could be a starting point for a more comprehensive and useful agentic systsem. Some of the proposed additional functionalities could be:\\\\\\\\n  1. Incorporating real-time video recording and conversational capabilities through different role scenarios.\\\\\\\\n  2. Playing back the user speech through an AI avatar to help users learn and understand best speaking practices.\\\\\\\\n  3. Keeping a record of user sessions.\\\\\\\\n  4. Including a performance dashboard to track user performance over time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Each of these additional functionalities could be added by implementing specific goal-oriented agents in the system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Together API** with **meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free** as LLM has a small token limit, therefore, it works with small video clips (15-30 seconds).\\\\\\\\n- Use other LLM options for longer video clips.

The knowledge base contains several practical implementations.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**\nUse specialized agents working together:\n- **Vision Agent**: Processes images/video using models like Gemini 2.0 Flash\n- **Analysis Agent**: Performs domain-specific analysis (UX, coding, content)\n- **Execution/Output Agent**: Generates results or executes code\n- **Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates the workflow between agents\n\n### 2. **Technology Stack**\n- **AI Models**: Google Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash or Pro (multimodal capabilities)\n- **Framework**: Phidata or Google ADK for agent orchestration\n- **Frontend**: Streamlit for user interface\n- **Additional Tools**: \n  - DuckDuckGo Search API for web research\n  - E2B Sandbox for code execution\n  - Pillow for image processing\n\n### 3. **Implementation Steps**\n\n**Setup Environment:**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/multimodal_design_agent_team\n\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**Get API Keys:**\n- Google Gemini API: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n- (Optional) OpenAI API for additional models\n- (Optional) E2B API for code execution: https://e2b.dev/docs/getting-started/api-key\n\n**Run the Application:**\n```bash\nstreamlit run design_agent_team.py\n```\n\n### 4. **Design Patterns**\n\n**Coordinator/Dispatcher Pattern:**\n- Central coordinator routes tasks to specialized agents\n- Agents work sequentially or in parallel\n- Results are aggregated and refined\n\n**Example workflow:**\n1. User uploads image/video + text query\n2. Vision agent extracts visual information\n3. Analysis agents process specific aspects\n4. Coordinator synthesizes results\n5. Output agent generates final response\n\n### 5. **Best Practices**\n\n- Upload clear, high-resolution images\n- Provide context about your use case\n- Use multiple views/inputs for better analysis\n- Implement iterative refinement (allow users to edit/refine outputs)\n- Add proper error handling and timeouts\n- Consider accessibility (WCAG compliance for UI/UX agents)\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\nThe knowledge base shows multimodal agents for:\n- **Design Analysis**: UI/UX feedback with visual hierarchy evaluation\n- **Coding Assistant**: Solve problems from images or text\n- **Speech Training**: Analyze video, audio, and facial expressions\n- **Home Renovation**: Analyze room photos and generate renderings\n\n[来源:

It depicts the potential of Agno as a team of collaborative agents working together seamlessly in order to address a real-world challenge - analyzing speech presentations by users and providing them with comprehensive evaluation and feedback to improve their public speaking skills. Each individual agent has a clear cut goal to follow and together they coordinate as a team to solve a complex multimodal problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- This project has a huge potential for further enhancements. It could be a starting point for a more comprehensive and useful agentic systsem. Some of the proposed additional functionalities could be:\\\\\\\\n  1. Incorporating real-time video recording and conversational capabilities through different role scenarios.\\\\\\\\n  2. Playing back the user speech through an AI avatar to help users learn and understand best speaking practices.\\\\\\\\n  3. Keeping a record of user sessions.\\\\\\\\n  4. Including a performance dashboard to track user performance over time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Each of these additional functionalities could be added by implementing specific goal-oriented agents in the system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Together API** with **meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free** as LLM has a small token limit, therefore, it works with small video clips (15-30 seconds).\\\\\\\\n- Use other LLM options for longer video clips.

However, I can provide guidance based on multi-agent architectures found in the documentation.\n\n## How to Build an AI Code Reviewer Agent\n\nWhile there's no dedicated code reviewer tutorial in the knowledge base, the multi-agent patterns can be adapted. Here's an approach based on the documented agent architectures:\n\n### Architecture Pattern\n\nBased on the **AI Legal Agent Team** pattern, you can build a code reviewer with specialized agents:\n\n1. **Code Analyzer Agent**: Reviews code structure, identifies patterns, and flags potential issues\n2. **Security Reviewer Agent**: Focuses on security vulnerabilities and best practices\n3. **Performance Reviewer Agent**: Analyzes performance implications and optimization opportunities\n4. **Team Lead Agent**: Coordinates the review and synthesizes findings\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Framework Options** (from the knowledge base):\n- **Agno Framework**: Used in multiple examples for agent orchestration\n- **Google ADK**: Provides built-in tools and agent coordination\n- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: Powers most agent implementations\n\n**Key Components**:\n```python\n# Based on the multi-agent team pattern\n- Specialized agents with distinct roles\n- Document/code analysis capabilities\n- Web search for best practices (using DuckDuckGo/Perplexity)\n- Structured output with specific findings\n- Citation of code sections being reviewed\n```\n\n### Similar Examples in Knowledge Base\n\nThe **AI Legal Agent Team** provides the closest architecture:\n- Multiple specialized agents working together\n- Document analysis (contracts → code files)\n- Specific section referencing\n- Risk assessment (legal risks → code risks)\n- Comprehensive reporting\n\n[来源:

Here's what it does:\n\n## Core Functionality\n\nThe agent provides **voice-powered responses** to customer questions by:\n- **Listening** to customer speech and converting it to text (speech-to-text)\n- **Processing** the query using AI models (like GPT-4o) to understand intent and retrieve relevant information\n- **Responding** by converting text answers back to natural-sounding speech (text-to-speech)\n\n## Key Components\n\n**Knowledge Base Integration**\n- Crawls and indexes documentation/support content using tools like Firecrawl\n- Stores information in vector databases (like Qdrant) for semantic search\n- Retrieves relevant answers based on customer questions\n\n**Memory & Context**\n- Maintains conversation history across interactions\n- Remembers customer profiles and past issues\n- Provides personalized support based on previous conversations\n\n**Voice Capabilities**\n- Multiple voice options for customization (alloy, ash, coral, echo, nova, etc.)\n- Natural speech patterns with proper pacing and emphasis\n- Real-time or turn-based conversation modes\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Answering questions about product documentation\n- Providing technical support through voice interaction\n- Handling customer inquiries with context awareness\n- Multi-language support with automatic language detection\n\nThe system essentially creates a conversational AI assistant that customers can talk to naturally, getting immediate voice responses based on your company's knowledge base.\n\n[来源:

自动路由到新 master\n```\n\n### 2. 手动重连\n\n如果使用普通客户端，需要：\n- 监听 Sentinel 的 `+switch-master` 事件\n- 主动断开旧连接，重新连接新 master\n\n### 3. 临时应急\n\n如果需要立即恢复写入：\n```bash\n# 查询当前 master 地址\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n\n# 手动连接到新 master\nredis-cli -h <new_master_ip> -p 6379\n```\n\n## 预防措施\n\n- ✅ 使用 Sentinel 客户端（自动切换）\n- ✅ 配置合理的连接超时和重试策略\n- ✅ 监控 Sentinel 日志中的 `+switch-master` 事件\n- ✅ 应用层实现写入失败重试机制\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 故障现象]**", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["READONLY", "replica", "failover", "SENTINEL", "master", "addr", "写入失败", "主从切换", "重连", "Sentinel"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "a789b1a6-f8ec-479c-8423-245799f34f55", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "b18d8e68-9c6e-417e-9542-eb595410c9d2", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来帮你检索这个 Redis 报错的解决方案。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_MEQc1AMaNZuKDSVPFjYOL1', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': \"READONLY You can't write against a read only replica\"})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_yOWBGEs8BEsYQ3Py1oUtj2', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': \"READONLY You can't write against a read only replica 报错解决\", 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_MEQc1AMaNZuKDSVPFjYOL1', content='Found 2 files\\ndocs/eval-review.md\\ndocs/runbook/redis-failover.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_yOWBGEs8BEsYQ3Py1oUtj2', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.578,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/eval-review.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review > 数据格式设计\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"无论是否引入 Ragas，统一数据格式（兼容 Ragas 的 SingleTurnSample）:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ntest_case = {\\\\\\\\n    #

Common reasons for that could be:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Starting Redis in a new environment\\\\\\\\n* Re-starting an ephemeral (cache-only) Redis, that uses functions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, we need to make sure that the pre-loaded functions are available before Redis accepts inbound user connections and commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo do that, it is possible to use `redis-cli --functions-rdb` to extract the functions from an existing server. This generates an RDB file that can be loaded by Redis at startup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis needs to have some information about how a function is going to behave when executed, in order to properly enforce resource usage policies and maintain data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, Redis needs to know that a certain function is read-only before permitting it to execute using [`FCALL_RO`]() on a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all functions may perform arbitrary read or write operations. Function Flags make it possible to declare more specific function behavior at the time of registration. Let\\'s see how this works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our previous example, we defined two functions that only read data. We can try executing them using [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis > FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n(error) ERR Can not execute a function with write flag using fcall_ro.\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis returns this error because a function can, in theory, perform both read and write operations on the database.\\\\\\\\nAs a safeguard and by default, Redis assumes that the function does both, so it blocks its execution.\\\\\\\\nThe server will reply with this error in the following cases:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Executing a function with [`FCALL`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n2. Using [`FCALL_RO`]() to execute a function.\\\\\\\\n3. A disk error was detected (Redis is unable to persist so it rejects writes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn these cases, you can add the `no-writes` flag to the function\\'s registration, disable the safeguard and allow them to run.\\\\\\\\nTo register a function with flags use the [named arguments]() variant of `redis.register_function`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe updated registration code snippet from the library looks like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function(\\'my_hset\\', my_hset)\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hgetall\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hgetall,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hlastmodified\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hlastmodified,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce we\\'ve replaced the library, Redis allows running both `my_hgetall` and `my_hlastmodified` with [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"myfield\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"some value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_field\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hlastmodified 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1640772721\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the complete documentation flags, please refer to [Script flags]().\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.9379,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Read-only replica\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Since Redis 2.6, replicas support a read-only mode that is enabled by default.\\\\\\\\nThis behavior is controlled by the `replica-read-only` option in the redis.conf file, and can be enabled and disabled at runtime using [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRead-only replicas will reject all write commands, so that it is not possible to write to a replica because of a mistake. This does not mean that the feature is intended to expose a replica instance to the internet or more generally to a network where untrusted clients exist, because administrative commands like [`DEBUG`](/commands/debug) or [`CONFIG`](/commands/config) are still enabled. The [Security]() page describes how to secure a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may wonder why it is possible to revert the read-only setting\\\\\\\\nand have replica instances that can be targeted by write operations.\\\\\\\\nThe answer is that writable replicas exist only for historical reasons.\\\\\\\\nUsing writable replicas can result in inconsistency between the master and the replica, so it is not recommended to use writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nTo understand in which situations this can be a problem, we need to understand how replication works.\\\\\\\\nChanges on the master is replicated by propagating regular Redis commands to the replica.\\\\\\\\nWhen a key expires on the master, this is propagated as a DEL command.\\\\\\\\nIf a key which exists on the master but is deleted, expired or has a different type on the replica compared to the master will react differently to commands like DEL, INCR or RPOP propagated from the master than intended.\\\\\\\\nThe propagated command may fail on the replica or result in a different outcome.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risks (if you insist on using writable replicas) we suggest you follow these recommendations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t write to keys in a writable replica that are also used on the master.\\\\\\\\n  (This can be hard to guarantee if you don\\'t have control over all the clients that write to the master.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica as an intermediary step when upgrading a set of instances in a running system.\\\\\\\\n  In general, don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica if it can ever be promoted to a master if you want to guarantee data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHistorically, there were some use cases that were considered legitimate for writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, these use cases are now all obsolete and the same can be achieved by other means.\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Computing slow Set or Sorted set operations and storing the result in temporary local keys using commands like [`SUNIONSTORE`](/commands/sunionstore) and [`ZINTERSTORE`](/commands/zinterstore).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use commands that return the result without storing it, such as [`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and [`ZINTER`](/commands/zinter).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using the [`SORT`](/commands/sort) command (which is not considered a read-only command because of the optional STORE option and therefore cannot be used on a read-only replica).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`SORT_RO`](/commands/sort_ro), which is a read-only command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using [`EVAL`](/commands/eval) and [`EVALSHA`](/commands/evalsha) are also not considered read-only commands, because the Lua script may call write commands.\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`EVAL_RO`](/commands/eval_ro) and [`EVALSHA_RO`](/commands/evalsha_ro) where the Lua script can only call read-only commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile writes to a replica will be discarded if the replica and the master resync or if the replica is restarted, there is no guarantee that they will sync automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore version 4.0, writable replicas were incapable of expiring keys with a time to live set.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if you use [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) or other commands that set a maximum TTL for a key, the key will leak, and while you may no longer see it while accessing it with read commands, you will see it in the count of keys and it will still use memory.\\\\\\\\nRedis 4.0 RC3 and greater versions are able to evict keys with TTL as masters do, with the exceptions of keys written in DB numbers greater than 63 (but by default Redis instances only have 16 databases).\\\\\\\\nNote though that even in versions greater than 4.0, using [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) on a key that could ever exists on the master can cause inconsistency between the replica and the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that since Redis 4.0 replica writes are only local, and are not propagated to sub-replicas attached to the instance. Sub-replicas instead will always receive the replication stream identical to the one sent by the top-level master to the intermediate replicas. So for example in the following setup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    A ---> B ---> C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if `B` is writable, C will not see `B` writes and will instead have identical dataset as the master instance `A`.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.3325,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Lua API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"_redis_ object {#redis_object} > `redis.register_function` {#redis.register_function} > Script flags {#script_flags}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Important:**\\\\\\\\nUse script flags with care, which may negatively impact if misused.\\\\\\\\nNote that the default for Eval scripts are different than the default for functions that are mentioned below, see [Eval Flags]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you register a function or load an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nThis results in the following behavior:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. They can read and write data.\\\\\\\\n1. They can run in cluster mode, and are not able to run commands accessing keys of different hash slots.\\\\\\\\n1. Execution against a stale replica is denied to avoid inconsistent reads.\\\\\\\\n1. Execution under low memory is denied to avoid exceeding the configured threshold.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can use the following flags and instruct the server to treat the scripts\\' execution differently:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `no-writes`: this flag indicates that the script only reads data but never writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    By default, Redis will deny the execution of flagged scripts (Functions and Eval scripts with [shebang]()) against read-only replicas, as they may attempt to perform writes.\\\\\\\\n    Similarly, the server will not allow calling scripts with [`FCALL_RO`]() / [`EVAL_RO`]().\\\\\\\\n    Lastly, when data persistence is at risk due to a disk error, execution is blocked as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Using this flag allows executing the script:\\\\\\\\n    1. With [`FCALL_RO`]() / [`EVAL_RO`]()\\\\\\\\n    2. On read-only replicas.\\\\\\\\n    3. Even if there\\'s a disk error (Redis is unable to persist so it rejects writes).\\\\\\\\n    4. When over the memory limit since it implies the script doesn\\'t increase memory consumption (see `allow-oom` below)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    However, note that the server will return an error if the script attempts to call a write command.\\\\\\\\n    Also note that currently [`PUBLISH`](), [`SPUBLISH`]() and [`PFCOUNT`]() are also considered write commands in scripts, because they could attempt to propagate commands to replicas and AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    For more information please refer to [Read-only scripts]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `allow-oom`: use this flag to allow a script to execute when the server is out of memory (OOM).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Unless used, Redis will deny the execution of flagged scripts (Functions and Eval scripts with [shebang]()) when in an OOM state.\\\\\\\\n    Furthermore, when you use this flag, the script can call any Redis command, including commands that aren\\'t usually allowed in this state.\\\\\\\\n    Specifying `no-writes` or using [`FCALL_RO`]() / [`EVAL_RO`]() also implies the script can run in OOM state (without specifying `allow-oom`)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `allow-stale`: a flag that enables running the flagged scripts (Functions and Eval scripts with [shebang]()) against a stale replica when the `replica-serve-stale-data` config is set to `no` .\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Redis can be set to prevent data consistency problems from using old data by having stale replicas return a runtime error.\\\\\\\\n    For scripts that do not access the data, this flag can be set to allow stale Redis replicas to run the script.\\\\\\\\n    Note however that the script will still be unable to execute any command that accesses stale data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `no-cluster`: the flag causes the script to return an error in Redis cluster mode.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Redis allows scripts to be executed both in standalone and cluster modes.\\\\\\\\n    Setting this flag prevents executing the script against nodes in the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `allow-cross-slot-keys`: The flag that allows a script to access keys from multiple slots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Redis typically prevents any single command from accessing keys that hash to multiple slots.\\\\\\\\n    This flag allows scripts to break this rule and access keys within the script that access multiple slots.\\\\\\\\n    Declared keys to the script are still always required to hash to a single slot.\\\\\\\\n    Accessing keys from multiple slots is discouraged as applications should be designed to only access keys from a single slot at a time, allowing slots to move between Redis servers.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    This flag has no effect when cluster mode is disabled.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to [Function Flags]() and [Eval Flags]() for a detailed example.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"这个报错是 **Redis Sentinel 主从切换后，应用仍连接到旧 master（已降级为 replica）导致的**。\\n\\n## 原因\\n\\n当 Redis Sentinel 触发 failover 后：\\n- 旧 master 被降级为 replica（只读）\\n- 应用如果没有及时更新连接，仍向旧节点发送写命令\\n- Redis 返回 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\\n\\n## 解决方案\\n\\n### 1. 使用 Sentinel 客户端自动切换\\n\\n**推荐方案**：使用支持 Sentinel 的 Redis 客户端，自动发现新 master\\n\\n```python\\n# Python 示例\\nfrom redis.sentinel import Sentinel\\n\\nsentinel = Sentinel([\\n    ('sentinel1', 26379),\\n    ('sentinel2', 26379),\\n    ('sentinel3', 26379)\\n], socket_timeout=0.1)\\n\\n# 自动连接当前 master\\nmaster = sentinel.master_for('mymaster', socket_timeout=0.1)\\nmaster.set('key', 'value')  #

TOKEN_EXPIRED 响应**\n   - 在 HTTP 拦截器中捕获该错误码\n   - 暂停当前失败的请求\n\n2. **调用刷新接口**\n   - 用存储的 `refresh_token` 请求 `/api/v1/auth/refresh`\n   - 获取新的 `access_token`（有效期 15 分钟）和新的 `refresh_token`（有效期 7 天）\n\n3. **重试原请求**\n   - 用新 token 重新发起之前失败的请求\n   - 更新本地存储的 token\n\n4. **刷新失败处理**\n   - 如果 refresh_token 也过期或无效，清除本地 token\n   - 跳转到登录页\n\n## 关键注意事项\n\n- **refresh_token 单次使用**：文档明确说明 refresh_token 使用后会立即轮换，必须保存新返回的 refresh_token\n- **并发请求处理**：如果多个请求同时遇到 TOKEN_EXPIRED，应该只发起一次刷新请求，其他请求等待刷新完成后重试\n- **HTTPS 传输**：所有 token 必须通过 HTTPS 传输\n\n## 典型实现伪代码\n\n```javascript\n//

\\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel API > Sentinel commands\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The `SENTINEL` command is the main API for Sentinel. The following is the list of its subcommands (minimal version is noted for where applicable):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG GET `<name>`** (`>= 6.2`) Get the current value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter. The specified name may be a wildcard, similar to the Redis [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG SET `<name>` `<value>`** (`>= 6.2`) Set the value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CKQUORUM `<master name>`** Check if the current Sentinel configuration is able to reach the quorum needed to failover a master, and the majority needed to authorize the failover. This command should be used in monitoring systems to check if a Sentinel deployment is ok.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FLUSHCONFIG** Force Sentinel to rewrite its configuration on disk, including the current Sentinel state. Normally Sentinel rewrites the configuration every time something changes in its state (in the context of the subset of the state which is persisted on disk across restart). However sometimes it is possible that the configuration file is lost because of operation errors, disk failures, package upgrade scripts or configuration managers. In those cases a way to force Sentinel to rewrite the configuration file is handy. This command works even if the previous configuration file is completely missing.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FAILOVER `<master name>`** Force a failover as if the master was not reachable, and without asking for agreement to other Sentinels (however a new version of the configuration will be published so that the other Sentinels will update their configurations).\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL GET-MASTER-ADDR-BY-NAME `<master name>`** Return the ip and port number of the master with that name. If a failover is in progress or terminated successfully for this master it returns the address and port of the promoted replica.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL INFO-CACHE** (`>= 3.2`) Return cached [`INFO`](/commands/info) output from masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR <ip> <port> <current-epoch> <runid>** Check if the master specified by ip:port is down from current Sentinel\\'s point of view. This command is mostly for internal use.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTER `<master name>`** Show the state and info of the specified master.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTERS** Show a list of monitored masters and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MONITOR** Start Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MYID** (`>= 6.2`) Return the ID of the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL PENDING-SCRIPTS** This command returns information about pending scripts.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REMOVE** Stop Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REPLICAS `<master name>`** (`>= 5.0`) Show a list of replicas for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SENTINELS `<master name>`** Show a list of sentinel instances for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SET** Set Sentinel\\'s monitoring configuration. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SIMULATE-FAILURE (crash-after-election|crash-after-promotion|help)** (`>= 3.2`) This command simulates different Sentinel crash scenarios.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL RESET `<pattern>`** This command will reset all the masters with matching name. The pattern argument is a glob-style pattern. The reset process clears any previous state in a master (including a failover in progress), and removes every replica and sentinel already discovered and associated with the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor connection management and administration purposes, Sentinel supports the following subset of Redis\\' commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **ACL** (`>= 6.2`) This command manages the Sentinel Access Control List. For more information refer to the [ACL]() documentation page and the [_Sentinel Access Control List authentication_](#sentinel-access-control-list-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **AUTH** (`>= 5.0.1`) Authenticate a client connection. For more information refer to the [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command and the [_Configuring Sentinel instances with authentication_ section](#configuring-sentinel-instances-with-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **CLIENT** This command manages client connections. For more information refer to its subcommands\\' pages.\\\\\\\\n* **COMMAND** (`>= 6.2`) This command returns information about commands. For more information refer to the [`COMMAND`](/commands/command) command and its various subcommands.\\\\\\\\n* **HELLO** (`>= 6.0`) Switch the connection\\'s protocol. For more information refer to the [`HELLO`](/commands/hello) command.\\\\\\\\n* **INFO** Return information and statistics about the Sentinel server. For more information see the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command.\\\\\\\\n* **PING** This command simply returns PONG.\\\\\\\\n* **ROLE** This command returns the string \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a list of monitored masters. For more information refer to the [`ROLE`](/commands/role) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SHUTDOWN** Shut down the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, Sentinel also supports the [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe), [`UNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/unsubscribe), [`PSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/psubscribe) and [`PUNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/punsubscribe) commands. Refer to the [_Pub/Sub Messages_ section](#pubsub-messages) for more details.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5641,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"A quick tutorial > Testing the failover\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"At this point our toy Sentinel deployment is ready to be tested. We can\\\\\\\\njust kill our master and check if the configuration changes. To do so\\\\\\\\nwe can just do:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli -p 6379 DEBUG sleep 30\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis command will make our master no longer reachable, sleeping for 30 seconds.\\\\\\\\nIt basically simulates a master hanging for some reason.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you check the Sentinel logs, you should be able to see a lot of action:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Each Sentinel detects the master is down with an `+sdown` event.\\\\\\\\n2. This event is later escalated to `+odown`, which means that multiple Sentinels agree about the fact the master is not reachable.\\\\\\\\n3.

Sentinel 客户端（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会自动切换：\n\n1. 确认客户端配置了 Sentinel 地址而非直连 master\n2. 确认连接池的 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置已开启\n3. **等待 30 秒**，观察错误率是否下降\n\n### 3. 手动恢复（如果应用直连 master IP）\n\n如果应用直连 master IP，需要手动切换：\n\n```bash\n# 1. 获取新 master 地址\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n\n# 2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\n\n# 3. 滚动重启应用\nkubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\n```\n\n### 4. 验证恢复\n\n```bash\n# 检查应用日志，确认 READONLY 错误消失\n# 检查监控，确认写入延迟恢复正常\n```\n\n## 根本原因\n\n- Sentinel 检测到 master 故障，自动提升 replica 为新 master\n- 应用层连接未及时切换，仍向旧 master（已降级为 replica）发送写命令\n- Replica 拒绝写操作，返回 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\n\n## 预防措施\n\n1. **使用 Sentinel 客户端**而非直连 IP\n2. 启用连接池的健康检查（`testOnBorrow`）\n3. 配置合理的连接超时和重试策略\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 故障现象 + 恢复操作]**", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/eval-review.md",

SIGSEGV\\\\\\\\n* SIGBUS\\\\\\\\n* SIGFPE\\\\\\\\n* SIGILL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce one of these signals is trapped, Redis stops any current operation and performs the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Adds a bug report to the log file. This includes a stack trace, dump of registers, and information about the state of clients.\\\\\\\\n* Since Redis 2.8, a fast memory test is performed as a first check of the reliability of the crashing system.\\\\\\\\n* If the server was daemonized, the PID file is removed.\\\\\\\\n* Finally the server unregisters its own signal handler for the received signal and resends the same signal to itself to make sure that the default action is performed, such as dumping the core on the file system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the child performing the Append Only File rewrite gets killed by a signal,\\\\\\\\nRedis handles this as an error and discards the (probably partial or corrupted)\\\\\\\\nAOF file. It will attempt the rewrite again later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the child performing an RDB save is killed, Redis handles the\\\\\\\\ncondition as a more severe error. While the failure of an\\\\\\\\nAOF file rewrite can cause AOF file enlargement, failed RDB file\\\\\\\\ncreation reduces durability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result of the child producing the RDB file being killed by a signal,\\\\\\\\nor when the child exits with an error (non zero exit code), Redis enters\\\\\\\\na special error condition where no further write command is accepted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis will continue to reply to read commands.\\\\\\\\n* Redis will reply to all write commands with a `MISCONFIG` error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis error condition will persist until it becomes possible to create an RDB file successfully.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes the user may want to kill the RDB-saving child process without\\\\\\\\ngenerating an error. Since Redis version 2.6.10, this can be done using the signal `SIGUSR1`. This signal is handled in a special way:\\\\\\\\nit kills the child process like any other signal, but the parent process will\\\\\\\\nnot detect this as a critical error and will continue to serve write\\\\\\\\nrequests.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.5003,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Transactions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Discarding the command queue\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"During a transaction it is possible to encounter two kind of command errors:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A command may fail to be queued, so there may be an error before [`EXEC`]() is called.\\\\\\\\nFor instance the command may be syntactically wrong (wrong number of arguments,\\\\\\\\nwrong command name, ...), or there may be some critical condition like an out of\\\\\\\\nmemory condition (if the server is configured to have a memory limit using the `maxmemory` directive).\\\\\\\\n* A command may fail *after* [`EXEC`]() is called, for instance since we performed\\\\\\\\nan operation against a key with the wrong value (like calling a list operation against a string value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStarting with Redis 2.6.5, the server will detect an error during the accumulation of commands.\\\\\\\\nIt will then refuse to execute the transaction returning an error during [`EXEC`](), discarding the transaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **Note for Redis < 2.6.5:** Prior to Redis 2.6.5 clients needed to detect errors occurring prior to [`EXEC`]() by checking\\\\\\\\nthe return value of the queued command: if the command replies with QUEUED it was\\\\\\\\nqueued correctly, otherwise Redis returns an error.\\\\\\\\nIf there is an error while queueing a command, most clients\\\\\\\\nwill abort and discard the transaction. Otherwise, if the client elected to proceed with the transaction\\\\\\\\nthe [`EXEC`]() command would execute all commands queued successfully regardless of previous errors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nErrors happening *after* [`EXEC`]() instead are not handled in a special way:\\\\\\\\nall the other commands will be executed even if some command fails during the transaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is more clear on the protocol level.

This may\\\\\\\\nsound unexpected as in the first part of this tutorial we stated that Redis\\\\\\\\nCluster can lose writes during the failover because it uses asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication. What we did not say is that this is not very likely to happen\\\\\\\\nbecause Redis sends the reply to the client, and the commands to replicate\\\\\\\\nto the replicas, about at the same time, so there is a very small window to\\\\\\\\nlose data. However the fact that it is hard to trigger does not mean that it\\\\\\\\nis impossible, so this does not change the consistency guarantees provided\\\\\\\\nby Redis cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can now check what is the cluster setup after the failover (note that\\\\\\\\nin the meantime I restarted the crashed instance so that it rejoins the\\\\\\\\ncluster as a replica):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes\\\\\\\\n3fc783611028b1707fd65345e763befb36454d73 127.0.0.1:7004 slave 3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 0 1385503418521 0 connected\\\\\\\\na211e242fc6b22a9427fed61285e85892fa04e08 127.0.0.1:7003 slave 97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 0 1385503419023 0 connected\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 127.0.0.1:7005 master - 0 1385503419023 3 connected 11423-16383\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385503417005 0 connected 5960-10921\\\\\\\\n2938205e12de373867bf38f1ca29d31d0ddb3e46 127.0.0.1:7002 slave 3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 0 1385503418016 3 connected\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow the masters are running on ports 7000, 7001 and 7005.

with an uppercase (space-delimited) word that conveys the error message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, the error \\\\\\\\\\\\\"SYNTAX invalid syntax\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is represented by the following protocol encoding:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    !21\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    SYNTAX invalid syntax\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(The raw RESP encoding is split into

this type and the string type and return a native string in both cases.\\\\\\\\nHowever, interactive clients, such as command line interfaces (e.g., [`redis-cli`]()), can use this type and know that their output should be presented to the human user as is and without quoting the string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, the Redis command [`INFO`]() outputs a report that includes newlines.\\\\\\\\nWhen using RESP3, `redis-cli` displays it correctly because it is sent as a Verbatim String reply (with its three bytes being \\\\\\\\\\\\\"txt\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\\\\nWhen using RESP2, however, the `redis-cli` is hard-coded to look for the [`INFO`]() command to ensure its correct display to the user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a

\\\\\"Simple strings are encoded as a plus (`+`) character, followed by a string.\\\\\\\\nThe string mustn\\'t contain a CR (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`) or LF (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) character and is terminated by CRLF (i.e., `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimple strings transmit short, non-binary strings with minimal overhead.\\\\\\\\nFor example, many Redis commands reply with just \\\\\\\\\\\\\"OK\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on success.\\\\\\\\nThe encoding of this Simple String is the following 5 bytes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    +OK\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis replies with a simple string, a client library should return to the caller a string value composed of the first character after the `+` up to the end of the string, excluding the final CRLF bytes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo send binary strings, use [bulk strings](#bulk-strings) instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"error-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP has specific data types for errors.\\\\\\\\nSimple errors, or simply just errors, are similar to [simple strings](#simple-strings), but their first character is the minus (`-`) character.\\\\\\\\nThe difference between simple strings and errors in RESP is that clients should treat errors as exceptions, whereas the string encoded in the error type is the error message itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe basic format is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    -Error message\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis replies with an error only when something goes wrong, for example, when you try to operate against the wrong data type, or when the command does not exist.\\\\\\\\nThe client should raise an exception when it receives an Error reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following are examples of error replies:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    -ERR unknown command \\'asdf\\'\\\\\\\\n    -WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first upper-case word after the `-`, up to the first space or newline, represents the kind of error returned.\\\\\\\\nThis word is called an _error prefix_.\\\\\\\\nNote that the error prefix is a convention used by Redis rather than part of the RESP error type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, in Redis, `ERR` is a generic error, whereas `WRONGTYPE` is a more specific error that implies that the client attempted an operation against the wrong data type.\\\\\\\\nThe error prefix allows the client to understand the type of error returned by the server without checking the exact error message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client implementation can return different types of exceptions for various errors, or provide a generic way for trapping errors by directly providing the error name to the caller as a string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, such a feature should not be considered vital as it is rarely useful. \\\\\\\\nAlso, simpler client implementations can return a generic error value, such as `false`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a

当前崩溃日志\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>\n\n# 上一次崩溃日志（更有价值）\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous\n```\n\n### 3. 检查资源限制\n```bash\nkubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].resources}'\n```\n\n如果是 OOMKilled，需要增加内存限制：\n```yaml\nresources:\n  requests:\n    memory: \"256Mi\"\n  limits:\n    memory: \"512Mi\"\n```\n\n### 4. 检查存活探针配置\n```bash\nkubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].livenessProbe}'\n```\n\n常见问题：\n- `initialDelaySeconds` 太短，应用还没启动完就被探测\n- 健康检查端点实现有误\n- 探测超时设置过于激进\n\n## 常见原因和修复方案\n\n| 原因 | 修复方法 |\n|------|---------|\n| OOMKilled | 增加内存限制或修复内存泄漏 |\n| 配置错误 | 检查 ConfigMap/Secret 挂载、环境变量 |\n| 依赖服务不可用 | 确保依赖的服务正在运行 |\n| 镜像问题 | 验证镜像标签和仓库访问权限 |\n| 存活探针失败 | 调整探针时间或修复健康检查端点 |\n| 权限拒绝 | 检查 SecurityContext 和 RBAC |\n\n## 紧急处理\n\n如果问题持续超过 30 分钟：\n1. 联系应用团队负责人\n2. 检查最近的部署：`kubectl rollout history deployment/<name>`\n3. 考虑回滚：`kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name>`\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/kubernetes-pod-crashloop.md > Kubernetes Pod CrashLoopBackOff Troubleshooting Guide]**", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"],

Such a feature depends\\\\\\\\non the ability of an instance to count the time, however Redis replicas correctly\\\\\\\\nreplicate keys with expires, even when such keys are altered using Lua\\\\\\\\nscripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo implement such a feature Redis cannot rely on the ability of the master and\\\\\\\\nreplica to have synced clocks, since this is a problem that cannot be solved\\\\\\\\nand would result in race conditions and diverging data sets, so Redis\\\\\\\\nuses three main techniques to make the replication of expired keys\\\\\\\\nable to work:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Replicas don\\'t expire keys, instead they wait for masters to expire the keys. When a master expires a key (or evict it because of LRU), it synthesizes a [`DEL`](/commands/del) command which is transmitted to all the replicas.\\\\\\\\n2. However because of master-driven expire, sometimes replicas may still have in memory keys that are already logically expired, since the master was not able to provide the [`DEL`](/commands/del) command in time. To deal with that the replica uses its logical clock to report that a key does not exist **only for read operations** that don\\'t violate the consistency of the data set (as new commands from the master will arrive). In this way replicas avoid reporting logically expired keys that are still existing. In practical terms, an HTML fragments cache that uses replicas to scale will avoid returning items that are already older than the desired time to live.\\\\\\\\n3. During Lua scripts executions no key expiries are performed. As a Lua script runs, conceptually the time in the master is frozen, so that a given key will either exist or not for all the time the script runs. This prevents keys expiring in the middle of a script, and is needed to send the same script to the replica in a way that is guaranteed to have the same effects in the data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce a replica is promoted to a master it will start to expire keys independently, and will not require any help from its old master.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"找到了相关文档！你遇到的 token 失效问题在 API 认证设计文档中有详细说明和解决方案。\\n\\n## 问题原因\\n\\naccess_token 的有效期设置为 **15 分钟**，这是出于安全考虑的设计。短期 token 可以降低泄露风险。\\n\\n## 解决方案：使用 Refresh Token\\n\\n系统提供了 refresh_token 机制，避免频繁重新登录：\\n\\n1. **登录时获取两个 token**：\\n   - `access_token`：有效期 15 分钟，用于日常 API 请求\\n   - `refresh_token`：有效期 7 天，用于刷新 access_token\\n\\n2. **自动刷新流程**：\\n   - 当 access_token 过期后，客户端用 refresh_token 调用 `/api/v1/auth/refresh` 接口\\n   - 服务端返回新的 access_token 和 refresh_token\\n   - refresh_token 采用**单次使用 + 立即轮换**机制（用一次就换新的）\\n\\n3. **错误码识别**：\\n   - 收到 `401 TOKEN_EXPIRED` 错误时，触发刷新逻辑\\n   - 收到 `401 UNAUTHORIZED` 表示 token 无效，需要重新登录\\n\\n## 客户端实现建议\\n\\n在请求拦截器中自动处理：\\n```javascript\\n// 伪代码示例\\nif (response.status === 401 && response.error === 'TOKEN_EXPIRED') {\\n  const newTokens = await refreshToken(currentRefreshToken);\\n  // 用新 token 重试原请求\\n  return retryOriginalRequest(newTokens.access_token);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n这样用户在 7 天内都不需要重新输入密码登录，只有 refresh_token 也过期时才需要重新登录。\\n\\n---\\n\\n**[来源: docs/api/authentication.md > API 认证与授权设计文档 > Token 验证]**  \\n**[来源: docs/api/authentication.md > API 认证与授权设计文档 > API 错误码]**\")]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "找到了相关文档！你遇到的 token 失效问题在 API 认证设计文档中有详细说明和解决方案。\n\n## 问题原因\n\naccess_token 的有效期设置为 **15 分钟**，这是出于安全考虑的设计。短期 token 可以降低泄露风险。\n\n## 解决方案：使用 Refresh Token\n\n系统提供了 refresh_token 机制，避免频繁重新登录：\n\n1. **登录时获取两个 token**：\n   - `access_token`：有效期 15 分钟，用于日常 API 请求\n   - `refresh_token`：有效期 7 天，用于刷新 access_token\n\n2. **自动刷新流程**：\n   - 当 access_token 过期后，客户端用 refresh_token 调用 `/api/v1/auth/refresh` 接口\n   - 服务端返回新的 access_token 和 refresh_token\n   - refresh_token 采用**单次使用 + 立即轮换**机制（用一次就换新的）\n\n3. **错误码识别**：\n   - 收到 `401 TOKEN_EXPIRED` 错误时，触发刷新逻辑\n   - 收到 `401 UNAUTHORIZED` 表示 token 无效，需要重新登录\n\n## 客户端实现建议\n\n在请求拦截器中自动处理：\n```javascript\n// 伪代码示例\nif (response.status === 401 && response.error === 'TOKEN_EXPIRED') {\n  const newTokens = await refreshToken(currentRefreshToken);\n  // 用新 token 重试原请求\n  return retryOriginalRequest(newTokens.access_token);\n}\n```\n\n这样用户在 7 天内都不需要重新输入密码登录，只有 refresh_token 也过期时才需要重新登录。\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/api/authentication.md > API 认证与授权设计文档 > Token 验证]**  \n**[来源: docs/api/authentication.md > API 认证与授权设计文档 > API 错误码]**", "session_id": "4a110ce0-fab4-44a3-befd-bf39027a8d12", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 91887, "total_cost_usd": 0.051489, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1242, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2486, "cache_read_input_tokens": 31083, "output_tokens": 568, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

Failover Command\n\nUse the `SENTINEL failover` command:\n\n```bash\nSENTINEL failover <master-name>\n```\n\nFor example, if your master is named \"mymaster\":\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen you execute a manual failover:\n\n1. **Clients are paused** - Clients connected to the current master are temporarily stopped\n2. **Replication offset sync** - The master sends its replication offset to the replica\n3. **Replica catches up** - The replica waits until it has processed all replication data from the old master\n4. **Failover election** - The replica starts a failover election and becomes the new master\n5. **Client redirection** - Clients are unblocked and redirected to the new master\n\n## Key Advantages\n\nManual failovers are **safer than automatic failovers** because they:\n- Avoid data loss by ensuring the new master has processed all replication data\n- Only switch clients when the system confirms replication is complete\n- Are useful for maintenance tasks like upgrading Redis instances with minimal downtime\n\n## Example Log Output\n\nWhen performing a manual failover, you'll see logs like:\n\n```\n# Manual failover user request accepted.\n# Received replication offset for paused master manual failover: 347540\n# All master replication stream processed, manual failover can start.\n# Start of election delayed for 0 milliseconds (rank #0, offset 347540).\n# Starting a failover election for epoch 7545.\n# Failover election won: I'm the new master.\n```\n\n[来源:

However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel. So instead of a hard coded IP address and port, a client supporting Sentinel should optionally be able to take as input:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A list of ip:port pairs pointing to known Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* The name of the service, like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"timelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the procedure a client should follow in order to obtain the master address starting from the list of Sentinels and the service name.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2875,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Manual failover\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Sometimes it is useful to force a failover without actually causing any problem\\\\\\\\non a master. For example, to upgrade the Redis process of one of the\\\\\\\\nmaster nodes it is a good idea to failover it to turn it into a replica\\\\\\\\nwith minimal impact on availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are supported by Redis Cluster using the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)\\\\\\\\ncommand, that must be executed in one of the replicas of the master you want\\\\\\\\nto failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are special and are safer compared to failovers resulting from\\\\\\\\nactual master failures. They occur in a way that avoids data loss in the\\\\\\\\nprocess, by switching clients from the original master to the new master only\\\\\\\\nwhen the system is sure that the new master processed all the replication stream\\\\\\\\nfrom the old one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what you see in the replica log when you perform a manual failover:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Manual failover user request accepted.\\\\\\\\n    # Received replication offset for paused master manual failover: 347540\\\\\\\\n    # All master replication stream processed, manual failover can start.\\\\\\\\n    # Start of election delayed for 0 milliseconds (rank #0, offset 347540).\\\\\\\\n    # Starting a failover election for epoch 7545.\\\\\\\\n    # Failover election won: I\\'m the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically clients connected to the master we are failing over are stopped.\\\\\\\\nAt the same time the master sends its replication offset to the replica, that\\\\\\\\nwaits to reach the offset on its side. When the replication offset is reached,\\\\\\\\nthe failover starts, and the old master is informed about the configuration\\\\\\\\nswitch. When the clients are unblocked on the old master, they are redirected\\\\\\\\nto the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTo promote a replica to master, it must first be known as a replica by a majority of the masters in the cluster.\\\\\\\\n  Otherwise, it cannot win the failover election.\\\\\\\\n  If the replica has just been added to the cluster (see [Add a new node as a replica](#add-a-new-node-as-a-replica)), you may need to wait a while before sending the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover) command, to make sure the masters in cluster are aware of the new replica.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6095,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-022\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > SDOWN and ODOWN failure state\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel has two different concepts of *being down*, one is called\\\\\\\\na *Subjectively Down* condition (SDOWN) and is a down condition that is\\\\\\\\nlocal to a given Sentinel instance. Another is called *Objectively Down*\\\\\\\\ncondition (ODOWN) and is reached when enough Sentinels (at least the\\\\\\\\nnumber configured as the `quorum` parameter of the monitored master) have\\\\\\\\nan SDOWN condition, and get feedback from other Sentinels using\\\\\\\\nthe `SENTINEL is-master-down-by-addr` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of a Sentinel an SDOWN condition is reached when it\\\\\\\\ndoes not receive a valid reply to PING requests for the number of seconds\\\\\\\\nspecified in the configuration as `is-master-down-after-milliseconds`\\\\\\\\nparameter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn acceptable reply to PING is one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with +PONG.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -LOADING error.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -MASTERDOWN error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAny other reply (or no reply at all) is considered non valid.\\\\\\\\nHowever note that **a logical master that advertises itself as a replica in\\\\\\\\nthe INFO output is considered to be down**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that SDOWN requires that no acceptable reply is received for the whole\\\\\\\\ninterval configured, so for instance if the interval is 30000 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n(30 seconds) and we receive an acceptable ping reply every 29 seconds, the\\\\\\\\ninstance is considered to be working.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSDOWN is not enough to trigger a failover: it only means a single Sentinel\\\\\\\\nbelieves a Redis instance is not available. To trigger a failover, the\\\\\\\\nODOWN state must be reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo switch from SDOWN to ODOWN no strong consensus algorithm is used, but\\\\\\\\njust a form of gossip: if a given Sentinel gets reports that a master\\\\\\\\nis not working from enough Sentinels **in a given time range**, the SDOWN is\\\\\\\\npromoted to ODOWN. If this acknowledge is later missing, the flag is cleared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA more strict authorization that uses an actual majority is required in\\\\\\\\norder to really start the failover, but no failover can be triggered without\\\\\\\\nreaching the ODOWN state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ODOWN condition **only applies to masters**. For other kind of instances\\\\\\\\nSentinel doesn\\'t require to act, so the ODOWN state is never reached for replicas\\\\\\\\nand other sentinels, but only SDOWN is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever SDOWN has also semantic implications. For example a replica in SDOWN\\\\\\\\nstate is not selected to be promoted by a Sentinel performing a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels and replicas auto discovery\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels stay connected with other Sentinels in order to reciprocally\\\\\\\\ncheck the availability of each other, and to exchange messages. However you\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t need to configure a list of other Sentinel addresses in every Sentinel\\\\\\\\ninstance you run, as Sentinel uses the Redis instances Pub/Sub capabilities\\\\\\\\nin order to discover the other Sentinels that are monitoring the same masters\\\\\\\\nand replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is implemented by sending *hello messages* into the channel named\\\\\\\\n`__sentinel__:hello`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly you don\\'t need to configure what is the list of the replicas attached\\\\\\\\nto a master, as Sentinel will auto discover this list querying Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel publishes a message to every monitored master and replica Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello`, every two seconds, announcing its presence with ip, port, runid.\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel is subscribed to the Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello` of every master and replica, looking for unknown sentinels. When new sentinels are detected, they are added as sentinels of this master.\\\\\\\\n* Hello messages also include the full current configuration of the master. If the receiving Sentinel has a configuration for a given master which is older than the one received, it updates to the new configuration immediately.\\\\\\\\n* Before adding a new sentinel to a master a Sentinel always checks if there is already a sentinel with the same runid or the same address (ip and port pair). In that case all the matching sentinels are removed, and the new added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel reconfiguration of instances outside the failover procedure\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven when no failover is in progress, Sentinels will always try to set the\\\\\\\\ncurrent configuration on monitored instances. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Replicas (according to the current configuration) that claim to be masters, will be configured as replicas to replicate with the current master.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas connected to a wrong master, will be reconfigured to replicate with the right master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinels to reconfigure replicas, the wrong configuration must be observed for some time, that is greater than the period used to broadcast new configurations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis prevents Sentinels with a stale configuration (for example because they just rejoined from a partition) will try to change the replicas configuration before receiving an update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note how the semantics of always trying to impose the current configuration makes the failover more resistant to partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Masters failed over are reconfigured as replicas when they return available.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas partitioned away during a partition are reconfigured once reachable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe important lesson to remember about this section is: **Sentinel is a system where each process will always try to impose the last logical configuration to the set of monitored instances**.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.5672,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Test the failover\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To trigger the failover, the simplest thing we can do (that is also\\\\\\\\nthe semantically simplest failure that can occur in a distributed system)\\\\\\\\nis to crash a single process, in our case a single master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nDuring this test, you should take a tab open with the consistency test\\\\\\\\napplication running.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can identify a master and crash it with the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes | grep master\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385482984082 0 connected 5960-10921\\\\\\\\n2938205e12de373867bf38f1ca29d31d0ddb3e46 127.0.0.1:7002 master - 0 1385482983582 0 connected 11423-16383\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOk, so 7000, 7001, and 7002 are masters.

7.2.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis API registers a callback to execute in addition to normal password based authentication.\\\\\\\\nMultiple callbacks can be registered across different modules. When a Module is unloaded, all the\\\\\\\\nauth callbacks registered by it are unregistered.\\\\\\\\nThe callbacks are attempted (in the order of most recently registered first) when the AUTH/HELLO\\\\\\\\n(with AUTH field provided) commands are called.\\\\\\\\nThe callbacks will be called with a module context along with a username and a password, and are\\\\\\\\nexpected to take one of the following actions:\\\\\\\\n(1) Authenticate - Use the `RedisModule_AuthenticateClient`* API and return `REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED`.\\\\\\\\nThis will immediately end the auth chain as successful and add the OK reply.\\\\\\\\n(2) Deny Authentication - Return `REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED` without authenticating or blocking the\\\\\\\\nclient. Optionally, `err` can be set to a custom error message and `err` will be automatically\\\\\\\\nfreed by the server.\\\\\\\\nThis will immediately end the auth chain as unsuccessful and add the ERR reply.\\\\\\\\n(3) Block a client on authentication - Use the [`RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth`](#RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth) API and return\\\\\\\\n`REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED`. Here, the client will be blocked until the [`RedisModule_UnblockClient`](#RedisModule_UnblockClient) API is used\\\\\\\\nwhich will trigger the auth reply callback (provided through the [`RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth`](#RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth)).\\\\\\\\nIn this reply callback, the Module should authenticate, deny or skip handling authentication.\\\\\\\\n(4) Skip handling Authentication - Return `REDISMODULE_AUTH_NOT_HANDLED` without blocking the\\\\\\\\nclient. This will allow the engine to attempt the next module auth callback.\\\\\\\\nIf none of the callbacks authenticate or deny auth, then password based auth is attempted and\\\\\\\\nwill authenticate or add failure logs and reply to the clients accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: If a client is disconnected while it was in the middle of blocking module auth, that\\\\\\\\noccurrence of the AUTH or HELLO command will not be tracked in the INFO command stats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of how non-blocking module based authentication can be used:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n     int

However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel. So instead of a hard coded IP address and port, a client supporting Sentinel should optionally be able to take as input:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A list of ip:port pairs pointing to known Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* The name of the service, like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"timelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the procedure a client should follow in order to obtain the master address starting from the list of Sentinels and the service name.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.0288,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/eval-review.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review > 数据格式设计\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"无论是否引入 Ragas，统一数据格式（兼容 Ragas 的 SingleTurnSample）:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ntest_case = {\\\\\\\\n    # 输入\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"user_input\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"READONLY You can\\'t write against a read only replica 怎么解决\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # 检索结果（从 Agent 日志提取）\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"retrieved_contexts\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换后...\\\\\\\\\\\\\",  # chunk text\\\\\\\\n    ],\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Agent 输出\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"response\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"根据文档，这个错误是 Redis Sentinel 主从切换导致的...\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Ground truth（手写）\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"reference\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"READONLY 错误是 Redis Sentinel failover 后，应用仍连接旧 master（已降为 replica）导致。解决方案：使用 Sentinel 客户端自动切换。\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # 元数据\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"expected_doc\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"redis-failover.md\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"source\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"local\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"exact\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n这个格式可以直接喂给:\\\\\\\\n- 我们的自建评估函数\\\\\\\\n- Ragas 的 `SingleTurnSample`\\\\\\\\n- 任何其他评测框架\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7125,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/runbook/redis-failover.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册 > 相关文档\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- 所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\\\\\\\\n- 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\\\\\\\\n- 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Redis Sentinel 架构设计\\\\\\\\n- 应用连接池配置规范\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2411,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Error reporting\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Once the service name is resolved into the master address and a connection is established with the Redis master instance, every time a reconnection is needed, the client should resolve again the address using Sentinels restarting from Step 1. For instance Sentinel should contacted again the following cases:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If the client reconnects after a timeout or socket error.\\\\\\\\n* If the client reconnects because it was explicitly closed or reconnected by the user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above cases and any other case where the client lost the connection with the Redis server, the client should resolve the master address again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStarting with Redis 2.8.12, when Redis Sentinel changes the configuration of\\\\\\\\nan instance, for example promoting a replica to a master, demoting a master to\\\\\\\\nreplicate to the new master after a failover, or simply changing the master\\\\\\\\naddress of a stale replica instance, it sends a `CLIENT KILL type normal`\\\\\\\\ncommand to the instance in order to make sure all the clients are disconnected\\\\\\\\nfrom the reconfigured instance. This will force clients to resolve the master\\\\\\\\naddress again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the client will contact a Sentinel with yet not updated information, the verification of the Redis instance role via the [`ROLE`]() command will fail, allowing the client to detect that the contacted Sentinel provided stale information, and will try again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: it is possible that a stale master returns online at the same time a client contacts a stale Sentinel instance, so the client may connect with a stale master, and yet the ROLE output will match. However when the master is back again Sentinel will try to demote it to replica, triggering a new disconnection. The same reasoning applies to connecting to stale replicas that will get reconfigured to replicate with a different master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes clients are interested to connect to replicas, for example in order to scale read requests.

in the output — this indicates the container exceeded its memory limits.\n\n## View Current Resource Limits\n\nCheck the configured resource limits:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].resources}'\n```\n\n## Check Logs\n\nView current and previous crash logs:\n\n```bash\n# Current crash logs\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>\n\n# Previous crash logs (from the killed container)\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous\n```\n\n## Fix OOMKilled Issues\n\nIf the container is being OOMKilled, increase the memory limits in your deployment:\n\n```yaml\nresources:\n  requests:\n    memory: \"256Mi\"\n  limits:\n    memory: \"512Mi\"\n```\n\n## Other Potential Causes\n\nIf it's not OOMKilled, check for:\n- **Liveness probe failures**: Probe might be too aggressive or `initialDelaySeconds` too short\n- **Config errors**: Check ConfigMap/Secret mounts and environment variables\n- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure dependent services are running\n\n```bash\n# Check liveness probe configuration\nkubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].livenessProbe}'\n```\n\n[来源:

Since cache entries are copies of persistently-stored data, it\\\\\\\\nis usually safe to evict them when the cache runs out of memory (they can be\\\\\\\\ncached again in the future if necessary).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lets you specify an eviction policy to evict keys automatically\\\\\\\\nwhen the size of the cache exceeds a set memory limit. Whenever a client\\\\\\\\nruns a new command that adds more data to the cache, Redis checks the memory usage.\\\\\\\\nIf it is greater than the limit, Redis evicts keys according to the chosen\\\\\\\\neviction policy until the total memory used is back below the limit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that when a command adds a lot of data to the cache (for example, a big set\\\\\\\\nintersection stored into a new key), this might temporarily exceed the limit by\\\\\\\\na large amount.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sections below explain how to [configure the memory limit](#maxmem) for the cache\\\\\\\\nand also describe the available [eviction policies](#eviction-policies) and when to\\\\\\\\nuse them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `maxmemory` configuration directive specifies\\\\\\\\nthe maximum amount of memory to use for the cache data.

使用**异步复制**机制。当主节点接收写命令后，会几乎同时做两件事：\n1. 向客户端返回响应\n2. 将命令复制到从节点\n\n虽然这两个操作时间窗口很小，但仍存在主节点已响应客户端、但数据还未复制到从节点就宕机的情况，此时会丢失这部分写入。\n\n根据 Redis 官方测试数据：在一次 failover 中，系统无法接受 578 次读和 577 次写，但**没有产生数据不一致**。\n\n## 如何保证数据一致性？\n\n### 1. 使用 Sentinel 客户端（必须）\n\n```\n禁止直连 master IP，必须使用 Sentinel 客户端\n```\n\n- 使用 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel 等客户端\n- 配置 Sentinel 地址而非 master 地址\n- 客户端会自动发现新 master 并切换连接\n\n### 2. 连接池配置\n\n```\nminEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000\ntestOnBorrow=true\n```\n\n确保连接池能及时检测并剔除失效连接。\n\n### 3. 定期演练 failover\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster\n```\n\n通过定期演练验证应用的容错能力。\n\n### 4. 监控关键指标\n\n- 监控 Sentinel 日志中的 `+switch-master` 事件\n- 监控应用日志中的 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\n- 监控 Redis 写入延迟\n\n## 故障恢复流程\n\n如果应用使用 Sentinel 客户端：\n1. 连接会自动切换到新 master\n2. 等待 30 秒观察错误率下降\n\n如果应用直连 master IP（不推荐）：\n1. 获取新 master：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\n2. 更新应用配置\n3.

do (that is also\\\\\\\\nthe semantically simplest failure that can occur in a distributed system)\\\\\\\\nis to crash a single process, in our case a single master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nDuring this test, you should take a tab open with the consistency test\\\\\\\\napplication running.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can identify a master and crash it with the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes | grep master\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385482984082 0 connected

connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOk, so 7000, 7001, and 7002 are masters. Let\\'s crash node 7002 with the\\\\\\\\n**DEBUG SEGFAULT** command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7002 debug segfault\\\\\\\\nError: Server closed the connection\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow we can look at the output of the consistency test to see what it reported.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n18849 R (0 err) | 18849 W (0 err) |\\\\\\\\n23151 R (0 err) | 23151 W (0 err) |\\\\\\\\n27302 R (0 err) | 27302 W (0 err) |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n... many error warnings here ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n29659 R (578 err) | 29660 W (577 err) |\\\\\\\\n33749 R (578 err) | 33750 W (577 err) |\\\\\\\\n37918 R (578 err) | 37919 W (577 err) |\\\\\\\\n42077 R (578 err) | 42078 W (577 err) |\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see during the failover the system was not able to accept 578 reads and 577 writes, however no inconsistency was created in the database. This may\\\\\\\\nsound unexpected as in the first part of this tutorial we stated that Redis\\\\\\\\nCluster can lose writes during the failover because it uses asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication. What we did not say is that this is not very likely to happen\\\\\\\\nbecause Redis sends the reply to the client, and the commands to replicate\\\\\\\\nto the replicas, about at the same time, so there is a very small window to\\\\\\\\nlose data. However the fact that it is hard to trigger does not mean that it\\\\\\\\nis impossible, so this does not change the consistency guarantees provided\\\\\\\\nby Redis cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can now check what is the cluster setup after the failover (note that\\\\\\\\nin the meantime I restarted the crashed instance so that it rejoins the\\\\\\\\ncluster as a replica):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes\\\\\\\\n3fc783611028b1707fd65345e763befb36454d73 127.0.0.1:7004 slave 3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 0 1385503418521 0 connected\\\\\\\\na211e242fc6b22a9427fed61285e85892fa04e08 127.0.0.1:7003 slave 97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 0 1385503419023 0 connected\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 127.0.0.1:7005 master - 0 1385503419023 3 connected 11423-16383\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385503417005 0 connected 5960-10921\\\\\\\\n2938205e12de373867bf38f1ca29d31d0ddb3e46 127.0.0.1:7002 slave 3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 0 1385503418016 3 connected\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow the masters are running on ports 7000, 7001 and 7005.

Use [`rladmin status shards db <db-name>`]() to list all shards for your database:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ```sh\\\\\\\\n    rladmin status shards db db-name\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Example output:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ```sh\\\\\\\\n    SHARDS:\\\\\\\\n    DB:ID   NAME                ID      NODE   ROLE   SLOTS   USED_MEMORY STATUS\\\\\\\\n    db:2    db-name             redis:1 node:1 master 0-16383 1.95MB      OK    \\\\\\\\n    db:2    db-name             redis:2 node:2 slave  0-16383 1.95MB      OK    \\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Note the following fields for the next steps: \\\\\\\\n    - `ID`: the Redis shard\\'s ID.\\\\\\\\n    - `NODE`: the node on which the shard currently resides.\\\\\\\\n    - `ROLE`: `master` is a primary shard; `slave` is a replica shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. For each replica shard, use [`rladmin migrate shard`]() to move it to a different node and restart it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ```sh\\\\\\\\n    rladmin migrate shard <shard_id> target_node <node_id>\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. After you migrate the replica shards, migrate the original primary shards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Rerun `rladmin status shards db <db-name>` to verify the shards migrated to different nodes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ```sh\\\\\\\\n    rladmin status shards db db-name\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Example output:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ```sh\\\\\\\\n    SHARDS:\\\\\\\\n    DB:ID   NAME                ID      NODE   ROLE   SLOTS   USED_MEMORY STATUS\\\\\\\\n    db:2    db-name             redis:1 node:2 master 0-16383 1.95MB      OK    \\\\\\\\n    db:2    db-name             redis:2 node:1 slave  0-16383 1.95MB      OK    \\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.35,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-019\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Migrate to Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Users willing to migrate to Redis Cluster may have just a single master, or\\\\\\\\nmay already using a preexisting sharding setup, where keys\\\\\\\\nare split among N nodes, using some in-house algorithm or a sharding algorithm\\\\\\\\nimplemented by their client library or Redis proxy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases it is possible to migrate to Redis Cluster easily, however\\\\\\\\nwhat is the most important detail is if multiple-keys operations are used\\\\\\\\nby the application, and how. There are three different cases:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Multiple keys operations, or transactions, or Lua scripts involving multiple keys, are not used. Keys are accessed independently (even if accessed via transactions or Lua scripts grouping multiple commands, about the same key, together).\\\\\\\\n2. Multiple keys operations, or transactions, or Lua scripts involving multiple keys are used but only with keys having the same **hash tag**, which means that the keys used together all have a `{...}` sub-string that happens to be identical. For example the following multiple keys operation is defined in the context of the same hash tag: `SUNION {user:1000}.foo {user:1000}.bar`.\\\\\\\\n3. Multiple keys operations, or transactions, or Lua scripts involving multiple keys are used with key names not having an explicit, or the same, hash tag.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe third case is not handled by Redis Cluster: the application requires to\\\\\\\\nbe modified in order to not use multi keys operations or only use them in\\\\\\\\nthe context of the same hash tag.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCase 1 and 2 are covered, so we\\'ll focus on those two cases, that are handled\\\\\\\\nin the same way, so no distinction will be made in the documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAssuming you have your preexisting data set split into N masters, where\\\\\\\\nN=1 if you have no preexisting sharding, the following steps are needed\\\\\\\\nin order to migrate your data set to Redis Cluster:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Stop your clients. No automatic live-migration to Redis Cluster is currently possible. You may be able to do it orchestrating a live migration in the context of your application / environment.\\\\\\\\n2. Generate an append only file for all of your N masters using the [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof) command, and waiting for the AOF file to be completely generated.\\\\\\\\n3. Save your AOF files from aof-1 to aof-N somewhere. At this point you can stop your old instances if you wish (this is useful since in non-virtualized deployments you often need to reuse the same computers).\\\\\\\\n4. Create a Redis Cluster composed of N masters and zero replicas. You\\'ll add replicas later. Make sure all your nodes are using the append only file for persistence.\\\\\\\\n5. Stop all the cluster nodes, substitute their append only file with your pre-existing append only files, aof-1 for the first node, aof-2 for the second node, up to aof-N.\\\\\\\\n6. Restart your Redis Cluster nodes with the new AOF files. They\\'ll complain that there are keys that should not be there according to their configuration.\\\\\\\\n7. Use `redis-cli --cluster fix` command in order to fix the cluster so that keys will be migrated according to the hash slots each node is authoritative or not.\\\\\\\\n8. Use `redis-cli --cluster check` at the end to make sure your cluster is ok.\\\\\\\\n9. Restart your clients modified to use a Redis Cluster aware client library.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is an alternative way to import data from external instances to a Redis\\\\\\\\nCluster, which is to use the `redis-cli --cluster import` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe command moves all the keys of a running instance (deleting the keys from\\\\\\\\nthe source instance) to the specified pre-existing Redis Cluster. However\\\\\\\\nnote that if you use a Redis 2.8 instance as source instance the operation\\\\\\\\nmay be slow since 2.8 does not implement migrate connection caching, so you\\\\\\\\nmay want to restart your source instance with a Redis 3.x version before\\\\\\\\nto perform such operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nStarting with Redis 5, if not for backward compatibility, the Redis project no longer uses the word slave. Unfortunately in this command the word slave is part of the protocol, so we\\'ll be able to remove such occurrences only when this API will be naturally deprecated.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.1853,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a3fe76ed\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a3fe76ed-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/Configuration.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configurations > lock-redis-timeout\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The `lock-redis-timeout` configuration option controls the maximum amount of time (in MS) a library can lock Redis.

lists, stream consumer group improvements, and improved durability.\\\\\\\\nSearch and Query brings the frequently asked Geo polygons queries for basic shapes and improved query performance on sorting in different scenarios. \\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands: [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) and [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) for more efficient data manipulation.\\\\\\\\nPreview of triggers and functions that allows developers to run JavaScript functions inside the Redis process.\\\\\\\\nLastly, 7.2 adds the option to use the new protocol [RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) improving the response format for all commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis server**:\\\\\\\\nRedis server 7.2 brings performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process.

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When new `configEpoch` values are created via replica promotion during\\\\\\\\nfailovers, they are guaranteed to be unique.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever there are two distinct events where new configEpoch values are\\\\\\\\ncreated in an unsafe way, just incrementing the local `currentEpoch` of\\\\\\\\nthe local node and hoping there are no conflicts at the same time.\\\\\\\\nBoth the events are system-administrator triggered:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover) command with `TAKEOVER` option is able to manually promote a replica node into a master *without the majority of masters being available*. This is useful, for example, in multi data center setups.\\\\\\\\n2. Migration of slots for cluster rebalancing also generates new configuration epochs inside the local node without agreement for performance reasons.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, during manual resharding, when a hash slot is migrated from\\\\\\\\na node A to a node B, the resharding program will force B to upgrade\\\\\\\\nits configuration to an epoch which is the greatest found in the cluster,\\\\\\\\nplus 1 (unless the node is already the one with the greatest configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch), without requiring agreement from other nodes.\\\\\\\\nUsually a real world resharding involves moving several hundred hash slots\\\\\\\\n(especially in small clusters). Requiring an agreement to generate new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration epochs during resharding, for each hash slot moved, is\\\\\\\\ninefficient. Moreover it requires a fsync in each of the cluster nodes\\\\\\\\nevery time in order to store the new configuration. Because of the way it is\\\\\\\\nperformed instead, we only need a new config epoch when the first hash slot is moved,\\\\\\\\nmaking it much more efficient in production environments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever because of the two cases above, it is possible (though unlikely) to end\\\\\\\\nwith multiple nodes having the same configuration epoch. A resharding operation\\\\\\\\nperformed by the system administrator, and a failover happening at the same\\\\\\\\ntime (plus a lot of bad luck) could cause `currentEpoch` collisions if\\\\\\\\nthey are not propagated fast enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, software bugs and filesystem corruptions can also contribute\\\\\\\\nto multiple nodes having the same configuration epoch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen masters serving different hash slots have the same `configEpoch`, there\\\\\\\\nare no issues. It is more important that replicas failing over a master have\\\\\\\\nunique configuration epochs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat said, manual interventions or resharding may change the cluster\\\\\\\\nconfiguration in different ways. The Redis Cluster main liveness property\\\\\\\\nrequires that slot configurations always converge, so under every circumstance\\\\\\\\nwe really want all the master nodes to have a different `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to enforce this, **a conflict resolution algorithm** is used in the\\\\\\\\nevent that two nodes end up with the same `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* IF a master node detects another master node is advertising itself with\\\\\\\\nthe same `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n* AND IF the node has a lexicographically smaller Node ID compared to the other node claiming the same `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n* THEN it increments its `currentEpoch` by 1, and uses it as the new `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf there are any set of nodes with the same `configEpoch`, all the nodes but the one with the greatest Node ID will move forward, guaranteeing that, eventually, every node will pick a unique configEpoch regardless of what happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism also guarantees that after a fresh cluster is created, all\\\\\\\\nnodes start with a different `configEpoch` (even if this is not actually\\\\\\\\nused) since `redis-cli` makes sure to use [`CLUSTER SET-CONFIG-EPOCH`](/commands/cluster-set-config-epoch) at startup.\\\\\\\\nHowever if for some reason a node is left misconfigured, it will update\\\\\\\\nits configuration to a different configuration epoch automatically.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.9191,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"See also\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis vector sets are efficient, but vector similarity indexing and graph traversal require memory tradeoffs.

This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits.

Some applications may require that all queries be served in less than 1 millisecond. For other applications, it may be acceptable for a small amount of clients to experience a 2 second latency on occasion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step to enable the latency monitor is to set a **latency threshold** in milliseconds. Only events that take longer than the specified threshold will be logged as latency spikes. The user should set the threshold according to their needs. For example, if the application requires a maximum acceptable latency of 100 milliseconds, the threshold should be set to log all the events blocking the server for a time equal or greater to 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEnable the latency monitor at runtime in a production server\\\\\\\\nwith the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMonitoring is turned off by default (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. While the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe user interface to the latency monitoring subsystem is the [`LATENCY`](/commands/latency) command.\\\\\\\\nLike many other Redis commands, [`LATENCY`](/commands/latency) accepts subcommands that modify its behavior.

In RediSearch 1.x, you had to manually add data to your indexes using the `FT.ADD` command. In RediSearch 2.x, your data is indexed automatically based on a key pattern.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese changes are designed to enhance developer productivity, and to ensure that\\\\\\\\nyour search indexes are always kept in sync with your data. To support this, we\\'ve\\\\\\\\nmade a few changes to the API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition to simplifying indexing, RediSearch 2.0 allows you to scale a single index over multiple Redis shards using the Redis cluster API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, RediSearch 2.x keeps its indexes outside of the main Redis key space. Improvements to the indexing code have increased query performance 2.4x.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can read more details in [the RediSearch 2.0 announcement blog post](https://redislabs.com/blog/introducing-redisearch-2-0/), and you can get started by checking out this [quick start blog post](https://redislabs.com/blog/getting-started-with-redisearch-2-0/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- When you create an index, you must specify a prefix condition and/or a filter. This determines which hashes RediSearch will index.\\\\\\\\n- Several RediSearch commands now map to their Redis equivalents: `FT.ADD` -> `HSET`, `FT.DEL` -> `DEL` (equivalent to `FT.DEL` with the DD flag in RediSearch 1.x), `FT.GET` -> `HGETALL`, `FT.MGET` -> `HGETALL`.\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch indexes no longer reside within the key space, and the indexes are no longer saved to the RDB.\\\\\\\\n- You can upgrade from RediSearch 1.x to RediSearch 2.x.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.1312,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7b321ff7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7b321ff7-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisearch/redisearch-2.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisearch 2.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v2.0.0 (September 2020) > Behavior changes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Make sure you review these changes before upgrading to RediSearch 2.0:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- [#1381](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/1381): `FT.SYNADD` is removed; use `FT.SYNUPDATE` instead. `FT.SYNUPDATE` requires both\\\\\\\\nand index name and a synonym group ID. This ID can be any ASCII string.\\\\\\\\n- [#1437](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/1437): Documents that expire during query execution time will not appear in the results (but might have been counted in the number of produced documents).\\\\\\\\n- [#1221](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/1221): Synonyms support for lower case.

\\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Script parameterization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"It is possible, although highly ill-advised, to have the application dynamically generate script source code per its needs.\\\\\\\\nFor example, the application could send these two entirely different, but at the same time perfectly identical scripts:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nredis> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough this mode of operation isn\\'t blocked by Redis, it is an anti-pattern due to script cache considerations (more on the topic below).\\\\\\\\nInstead of having your application generate subtle variations of the same scripts, you can parametrize them and pass any arguments needed for to execute them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following example demonstrates how to achieve the same effects as above, but via parameterization:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return ARGV[1]\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 Hello\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nredis> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return ARGV[1]\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 Parameterization!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Parameterization!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt this point, it is essential to understand the distinction Redis makes between input arguments that are names of keys and those that aren\\'t.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile key names in Redis are just strings, unlike any other string values, these represent keys in the database.\\\\\\\\nThe name of a key is a fundamental concept in Redis and is the basis for operating the Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Important:**\\\\\\\\nto ensure the correct execution of scripts, both in standalone and clustered deployments, all names of keys that a script accesses must be explicitly provided as input key arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe script **should only** access keys whose names are given as input arguments.\\\\\\\\nScripts **should never** access keys with programmatically-generated names or based on the contents of data structures stored in the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAny input to the function that isn\\'t the name of a key is a regular input argument.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the example above, both _Hello_ and _Parameterization!_ regular input arguments for the script.\\\\\\\\nBecause the script doesn\\'t touch any keys, we use the numerical argument _0_ to specify there are no key name arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe execution context makes arguments available to the script through [_KEYS_]() and [_ARGV_]() global runtime variables.\\\\\\\\nThe _KEYS_ table is pre-populated with all key name arguments provided to the script before its execution, whereas the _ARGV_ table serves a similar purpose but for regular arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following attempts to demonstrate the distribution of input arguments between the scripts _KEYS_ and _ARGV_ runtime global variables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return { KEYS[1], KEYS[2], ARGV[1], ARGV[2], ARGV[3] }\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 2 key1 key2 arg1 arg2 arg3\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"key1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"key2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"arg1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"arg2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5)

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Adding a new Sentinel to your deployment is a simple process because of the\\\\\\\\nauto-discover mechanism implemented by Sentinel. All you need to do is to\\\\\\\\nstart the new Sentinel configured to monitor the currently active master.\\\\\\\\nWithin 10 seconds the Sentinel will acquire the list of other Sentinels and\\\\\\\\nthe set of replicas attached to the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you need to add multiple Sentinels at once, it is suggested to add it\\\\\\\\none after the other, waiting for all the other Sentinels to already know\\\\\\\\nabout the first one before adding the next. This is useful in order to still\\\\\\\\nguarantee that majority can be achieved only in one side of a partition,\\\\\\\\nin the chance failures should happen in the process of adding new Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis can be easily achieved by adding every new Sentinel with a 30 seconds delay, and during absence of network partitions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt the end of the process it is possible to use the command\\\\\\\\n`SENTINEL MASTER mastername` in order to check if all the Sentinels agree about\\\\\\\\nthe total number of Sentinels monitoring the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRemoving a Sentinel is a bit more complex: **Sentinels never forget already seen\\\\\\\\nSentinels**, even if they are not reachable for a long time, since we don\\'t\\\\\\\\nwant to dynamically change the majority needed to authorize a failover and\\\\\\\\nthe creation of a new configuration number. So in order to remove a Sentinel\\\\\\\\nthe following steps should be performed in absence of network partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Stop the Sentinel process of the Sentinel you want to remove.\\\\\\\\n2. Send a `SENTINEL RESET *` command to all the other Sentinel instances (instead of `*` you can use the exact master name if you want to reset just a single master). One after the other, waiting at least 30 seconds between instances.\\\\\\\\n3. Check that all the Sentinels agree about the number of Sentinels currently active, by inspecting the output of `SENTINEL MASTER mastername` of every Sentinel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels never forget about replicas of a given master, even when they are\\\\\\\\nunreachable for a long time. This is useful, because Sentinels should be able\\\\\\\\nto correctly reconfigure a returning replica after a network partition or a\\\\\\\\nfailure event.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, after a failover, the failed over master is virtually added as a\\\\\\\\nreplica of the new master, this way it will be reconfigured to replicate with\\\\\\\\nthe new master as soon as it will be available again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever sometimes you want to remove a replica (that may be the old master)\\\\\\\\nforever from the list of replicas monitored by Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to do this, you need to send a `SENTINEL RESET mastername` command\\\\\\\\nto all the Sentinels: they\\'ll refresh the list of replicas within the next\\\\\\\\n10 seconds, only adding the ones listed as correctly replicating from the\\\\\\\\ncurrent master [`INFO`](/commands/info) output.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='❌ 未找到相关文档。\\n\\n知识库中没有关于 Spring Boot 应用部署到 AWS ECS 的文档。当前索引的内容主要包括：\\n\\n- Redis 官方文档（数据类型、管理、安全、优化等）\\n- LLM 应用开发教程（RAG、AI Agents、多智能体系统等）\\n- 本地运维文档（Redis 故障恢复、Kubernetes 排查、API 认证）\\n\\n如果需要这方面的信息，建议：\\n1. 导入相关文档到知识库（使用 `/ingest` 或 `/ingest-repo`）\\n2. 或者直接查阅 AWS ECS 和 Spring Boot 的官方文档')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "❌ 未找到相关文档。\n\n知识库中没有关于 Spring Boot 应用部署到 AWS ECS 的文档。当前索引的内容主要包括：\n\n- Redis 官方文档（数据类型、管理、安全、优化等）\n- LLM 应用开发教程（RAG、AI Agents、多智能体系统等）\n- 本地运维文档（Redis 故障恢复、Kubernetes 排查、API 认证）\n\n如果需要这方面的信息，建议：\n1. 导入相关文档到知识库（使用 `/ingest` 或 `/ingest-repo`）\n2. 或者直接查阅 AWS ECS 和 Spring Boot 的官方文档", "session_id": "0220deee-5468-4769-8abe-b942a1f611b9", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 149646, "total_cost_usd": 0.0460315, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1350, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2702, "cache_read_input_tokens": 33788, "output_tokens": 220, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

file using a built-in default\\\\\\\\nconfiguration, however this setup is only recommended for testing and\\\\\\\\ndevelopment purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe proper way to configure Redis is by providing a Redis configuration file,\\\\\\\\nusually called `redis.conf`. Beginning with Redis 8 in Redis Open Source, there are two configuration files:\\\\\\\\n* `redis.conf` - contains the configuration settings for Redis server only.\\\\\\\\n* `redis-full.conf` - contains configuration settings for Redis server and all available components: Redis Query Engine, Redis time series, and Redis probabilistic data structures. This file has as its first line `include redis.conf`, which pulls in the Redis server configuration settings at startup. Use `redis-full.conf` when you want to enable all available components. The file contains four `loadmodule` directives, one for each component, and also loads Redis JSON (though JSON has no configuration parameters).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are building Redis from source and choose to build Redis server without the available components, you can use `redis.conf` as your configuration file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach configuration file contains a number of directives that have a very simple format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    keyword argument1 argument2 ... argumentN\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of a configuration directive:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    replicaof 127.0.0.1 6380\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to provide strings containing spaces as arguments using\\\\\\\\n(double or single) quotes, as in the following example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    requirepass \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello world\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle-quoted string can contain characters escaped by backslashes, and\\\\\\\\ndouble-quoted strings can additionally include any ASCII symbols encoded using\\\\\\\\nbackslashed hexadecimal notation \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xff\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe list of configuration directives, along with comments describing their meaning and intended usage, is available in the self-documented sample\\xa0files `redis.conf`\\xa0and\\xa0`redis-full.conf`\\xa0files shipped with the Redis distributions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Configuration files for Redis 8.6: [redis-full.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.6/redis-full.conf) and [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.6/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration files for Redis 8.4: [redis-full.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.4/redis-full.conf) and [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.4/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration files for Redis 8.2: [redis-full.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.2/redis-full.conf) and [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.2/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration files for Redis 8.0: [redis-full.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.0/redis-full.conf) and [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.0/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration file for Redis 7.4: [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.4/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration file for Redis 7.2: [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.2/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration file for Redis 7.0: [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.0/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration file for Redis 6.2: [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/6.2/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPassing arguments using the command line\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also pass Redis configuration parameters\\\\\\\\nusing the command line directly. This is very useful for testing purposes.\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example that starts a new Redis instance using port 6380\\\\\\\\nas a replica of the instance running at 127.0.0.1 port 6379.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server --port 6380 --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe format of the arguments passed using the command line is exactly the same\\\\\\\\nas the one used in the redis.conf file, with the exception that the keyword\\\\\\\\nis prefixed with `--`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that internally this generates an in-memory temporary config file\\\\\\\\n(possibly concatenating the config file passed by the user, if any) where\\\\\\\\narguments are translated into the format of redis.conf.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChanging Redis configuration while the server is running\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to reconfigure Redis on the fly without stopping and restarting\\\\\\\\nthe service, or querying the current configuration programmatically using the\\\\\\\\nspecial commands [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) and [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNot all of the configuration directives are supported in this way, but most\\\\\\\\nare supported as expected.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) and [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) pages for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that modifying the configuration on the fly does not affect the\\\\\\\\n`redis.conf` and `redis-full.conf` files, so at the next restart of Redis, the old configuration will\\\\\\\\nbe used instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to also modify the configuration files accordingly to the configuration\\\\\\\\nyou set using [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set).\\\\\\\\nYou can do it manually, or you can use [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite), which will automatically scan your configuration files and update the fields that don\\'t match the current configuration value.\\\\\\\\nFields set to the default value are not added.\\\\\\\\nComments inside your configuration file are retained.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfiguring Redis as a cache\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you plan to use Redis as a cache where every key will have an\\\\\\\\nexpire set, you may consider using the following configuration instead\\\\\\\\n(assuming a max memory limit of 2 megabytes as an example):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    maxmemory 2mb\\\\\\\\n    maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration there is no need for the application to set a\\\\\\\\ntime to live for keys using the [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) command (or equivalent) since\\\\\\\\nall the keys will be evicted using an approximated LRU algorithm as long\\\\\\\\nas we hit the 2 megabyte memory limit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically, in this configuration Redis acts in a similar way to memcached.\\\\\\\\nWe have more extensive documentation about using Redis as an LRU cache [here]().\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.8507,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-005\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel quick start > Example Sentinel deployments > Example 2: basic setup with three boxes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This is a very simple setup, that has the advantage to be simple to tune\\\\\\\\nfor additional safety.

However in\\\\\\\\nthe above setup there is a higher risk due to clients being partitioned away\\\\\\\\nwith an old master, like in the following picture:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n             +----+\\\\\\\\n             | M1 |\\\\\\\\n             | S1 | <- C1 (writes will be lost)\\\\\\\\n             +----+\\\\\\\\n                |\\\\\\\\n                /\\\\\\\\n                /\\\\\\\\n    +------+    |    +----+\\\\\\\\n    | [M2] |----+----| R3 |\\\\\\\\n    | S2   |         | S3 |\\\\\\\\n    +------+         +----+\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this case a network partition isolated the old master M1, so the\\\\\\\\nreplica R2 is promoted to master. However clients, like C1, that are\\\\\\\\nin the same partition as the old master, may continue to write data\\\\\\\\nto the old master. This data will be lost forever since when the partition\\\\\\\\nwill heal, the master will be reconfigured as a replica of the new master,\\\\\\\\ndiscarding its data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis problem can be mitigated using the following Redis replication\\\\\\\\nfeature, that allows to stop accepting writes if a master detects that\\\\\\\\nit is no longer able to transfer its writes to the specified number of replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration, the old Redis master M1 in the above example, will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel configuration will converge to the new one, the client C1 will be able to fetch a valid configuration and will continue with the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever there is no free lunch. With this refinement, if the two replicas are\\\\\\\\ndown, the master will stop accepting writes. It\\'s a trade off.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='❌ 未找到相关文档。\\n\\n知识库中没有关于 RabbitMQ dead letter queue 配置的文档。检索结果返回的都是 Redis 相关的配置文档（Redis Sentinel、Redis 配置等），与 RabbitMQ 无关。\\n\\n当前知识库主要包含：\\n- Redis 官方文档（数据类型、管理、优化等）\\n- LLM 应用开发相关文档\\n- 本地运维 runbook（Redis 故障恢复、Kubernetes 排查等）\\n\\n如果需要 RabbitMQ 相关文档，可以使用 `/ingest-repo` 导入 RabbitMQ 官方文档仓库。')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "❌ 未找到相关文档。\n\n知识库中没有关于 RabbitMQ dead letter queue 配置的文档。检索结果返回的都是 Redis 相关的配置文档（Redis Sentinel、Redis 配置等），与 RabbitMQ 无关。\n\n当前知识库主要包含：\n- Redis 官方文档（数据类型、管理、优化等）\n- LLM 应用开发相关文档\n- 本地运维 runbook（Redis 故障恢复、Kubernetes 排查等）\n\n如果需要 RabbitMQ 相关文档，可以使用 `/ingest-repo` 导入 RabbitMQ 官方文档仓库。", "session_id": "c01596ad-1e4b-4dcb-9017-c91285744617", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 83917, "total_cost_usd": 0.0449465, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1313, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2626, "cache_read_input_tokens": 32838, "output_tokens": 222, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

Hash tags are a way to ensure that multiple keys\\\\\\\\nare allocated in the same hash slot.

This is useful when using binary data as key names.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.6514,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Key distribution model\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The cluster\\'s key space is split into 16384 slots, effectively setting an upper limit\\\\\\\\nfor the cluster size of 16384 master nodes (however, the suggested max size of\\\\\\\\nnodes is on the order of ~ 1000 nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach master node in a cluster handles a subset of the 16384 hash slots.\\\\\\\\nThe cluster is **stable** when there is no cluster reconfiguration in\\\\\\\\nprogress (i.e. where hash slots are being moved from one node to another).\\\\\\\\nWhen the cluster is stable, a single hash slot will be served by a single node\\\\\\\\n(however the serving node can have one or more replicas that will replace it in the case of net splits or failures,\\\\\\\\nand that can be used in order to scale read operations where reading stale data is acceptable).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe base algorithm used to map keys to hash slots is the following\\\\\\\\n(read the next paragraph for the hash tag exception to this rule):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe CRC16 is specified as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\\\\\\\\n* Width: 16 bit\\\\\\\\n* Poly: 1021 (That is actually x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\\\\\\\\n* Initialization: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Input byte: False\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Output CRC: False\\\\\\\\n* Xor constant to output CRC: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Output for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"123456789\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 31C3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n14 out of 16 CRC16 output bits are used (this is why there is\\\\\\\\na modulo 16384 operation in the formula above).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our tests CRC16 behaved remarkably well in distributing different kinds of\\\\\\\\nkeys evenly across the 16384 slots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note**: A reference implementation of the CRC16 algorithm used is available in the Appendix A of this document.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"❌ 未找到相关文档。\\n\\nThe knowledge base doesn't contain information about Hystrix or the circuit breaker pattern implementation.
