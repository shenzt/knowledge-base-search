To do this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Go to: Start > Run and type \\'%temp%\\' to navigate to the temporary path for Windows Installer programs. Delete all contents within this folder.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Run the installer executable (SPSS_Modeler_141_win64.exe) as normal. When it finishes extracting and decompressing the .msi file and the end-user is required to click \\'Continue\\', minimise this window.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Switch to the %temp% folder and locate the folder with the \\'ModelerClient64.msi\\' file. Copy ALL contents within this folder and paste it to a local folder (e.g. C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Temp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Modeler\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ClientInstall).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Once copied, switch back to the installation wizard and hit \\'Cancel\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 2: Use the command prompt to execute the \\'MsiExec\\' command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Open a command prompt window as an Administrator and run the following command: (substitute <path> with the location of your .msi file)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMsiExec.exe /i \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<path>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ModelerClient.msi\\\\\\\\\\\\\" /qn /L*v logfile.txt INSTALLDIR=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\IBM\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\SPSS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Modeler\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\14\\\\\\\\\\\\\" LICENSETYPE=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Network\\\\\\\\\\\\\" LSHOST=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mylicserver\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* For a full list of Silent Install options, please refer to the \\'NetworkLicenseAdministratorsGuide.pdf\\' > \\'Installaing the Product on the Local Desktop Computers > Pushing an Installation to Windows Computers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce that you have confirmed that Modeler Client is operational, repeat the steps to extract the .msi file for Modeler Client Fix Pack 1. Please note that it is highly recommended to delete the contents of the temporary folder as the Fix Pack and Client installations use the same file names. This is to prevent the accidental copying of the Client installation instead of the Fix Pack install.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Need more help? Our Modeler forum is Live!

Accessing the.msi file for IBM SPSS Statistics is dependent upon the installation media you have received.\\\\\\\\nUsing the Software Download:\\\\\\\\n1. Download and save the installer executable (e.g. \\'SPSS_Statistics_24_win64.exe\\') to a known, accessible location on the computer hard drive.\\\\\\\\n2. Next, you will need to use the /b switch from your command prompt to extract the .msi file.\\\\\\\\nIn the example below the SPSS_Statistics_24_win64.exe was downloaded to the C: drive.\\\\\\\\nProvide the file location for the extraction. This example uses the directory \\\\\\\\\\\\\"MSItest\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on the C: drive:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nC:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\>SPSS_Statistics_24_win64.exe /b\\\\\\\\\\\\\"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\MSItest\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Notice that running this command will launch the InstallShield Wizard. Let this run until the .msi has been extracted. You will see \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Extracting: IBM SPSS Statistics 24.msi\\\\\\\\\\\\\" message from the installer. You do not need to proceed with the full installation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing Installation Media (CD/DVD)\\\\\\\\n1. Insert the disk.\\\\\\\\n2. IF prompted to install the software, select \\'Cancel\\'.\\\\\\\\n3. Browse to the media location.\\\\\\\\n4. Open the \\'SPSSStatistics\\' folder.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe 32-bit MSI file will be located in the \\'win32\\'. folder.\\\\\\\\nThe 64-bit MSI file will be located in the \\'win64\\' folder.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing a compressed (.zip) file\\\\\\\\n1. Extract (decompress) the contents of the ZIP file into a designated folder.\\\\\\\\n2. The MSI folder will located in the designated folder.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor documentation on IBM SPSS-specific commands for use with MSI files, see \\'Administrator\\'s Guide\\' appropriate to your license type (e.g. \\'Site\\', \\'Concurrent\\' Users Guide\\').\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Need more help?

Prior to use of IM, the fixpacks for IHS (V7 and V6.x) did not include files expected to be customized such as default static content files like index.html and other HTML, GIF, and ICO files installed by IHS to its <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs directory. More importantly the admin.passwd file (that holds the user/passsword for the IHS Admin Service) is usually configured right after install when using the Plugin Configration Tool (PCT).\\n    14→\\n    15→Prior to use of IM you could not install directly to a fixpack level. You had to install the base GA code (i.e. 7.0.0.0 or 6.1.0.0) and then use the Update Installer to apply fixpacks. IM supports installation directly to a fixpack level therefore all install files included with the base GA code 8.0.0.0 are applied with the fixpack. Any files that should not be overwritten must be listed in a exception list (of non-serviceable files) that the IM installer can reference. This list of non-serviceable files was ommitted or incomplete for IHS V8.0.0.0 and 8.5.0.0 so the install of the first fixpack (regardless of fixpack level) may overwrite files such as admin.passwd and index.html.\\n    16→\\n    17→There are two APAR related to the same event:\\n    18→.\\n    19→PM71612: ADDITIONAL NON-SERVICEABLE FILES ADDED FOR IBM HTTP SERVER.\\n    20→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM71612 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM71612]\\n    21→.\\n    22→PM63634: IHS CONFIG ADMIN.PASSWD FILE WAS RESET AFTER INSTALLING\\n    23→FIXPACK 3 ON WAS 8.0.0.2 or 7.0.0.25 on Windows.\\n    24→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM63634 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM63634]\\n    25→\\n    26→.\\n    27→The technote about PM63634: IHS CONFIG ADMIN.PASSWD FILE WAS RESET advises a resolution in reseting the admin.passwd file:\\n    28→\\n    29→Installation of IBM HTTP Server 7.0.0.25, 8.0.0.1, 8.0.0.2, 8.0.0.3 will overlay admin.passwd:\\n    30→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593118 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593118]\\n    31→\\n    32→The main impact is that the IHS admin.passwd file gets overwritten which means the IHS Admin User/PW must be reset with the htpasswd utility in the IHS bin directory. Some customers customize the IHS splash page (index.html) or other default pages provided by IHS install so apply of first fixpack can overwrite these files and the customer\\'s customization.\\n    33→\\n    34→The list of these non-serviceable files where included in 8.0.0.5 and 8.5.0.1 per the APAR links above so once that fixpack level is applied then any future fixpacks will not overwrite these files. There is no way to avoid the event if GA 8.0.0.0/8.5.0.0 IHS is installed first. The first fixpack applied (of any fixpack) could replace the files.\\n    35→\\n    36→This Technote defines three recommendations to avoid the problem.\\n    37→\\n    38→SYMPTOM\\n    39→- The admin.passwd is a zero byte file after apply of fixpack\\n    40→\\n    41→ - Any content installed under <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs by IHS install (default static content files) that have been customized are replaced by their default originals after apply of fixpack\\n    42→\\n    43→CAUSE\\n    44→Files not marked as non-serviceable files for IM install of fixpacks for IHS per APAR PM71612\\n    45→\\n    46→ENVIRONMENT\\n    47→WebSphere environments that use IHS v8.x to run the WSAS plugin for Webservers to act as proxy front to WSAS appservers.\\n    48→\\n    49→RESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\n    50→Support suggests one of three recommendations to avoid the problem:\\n    51→\\n    52→1. Use IM to install IHS at fixpack 8.0.0.5/8.5.0.1 or higher bypassing the install of 8.0.0.0/8.5.0.0\\n    53→\\n    54→2. Do not use PCT, configure IHS Admin or use htpasswd (or other customization/config) until after fixpack has been applied.\\n    55→\\n    56→3. If you have already installed 8.0.0.0 or 8.5.0.0 then before you apply your first IHS fixpack backup these files:\\n    57→\\n    58→- admin.passwd\\n    59→\\n    60→- all content under <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs\\n    61→\\n    62→\\n    63→\\n    64→PRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\\n    65→ IHS\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

For key export to work, various conditions must be met:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines\\\\\\\\n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen\\'s exportable option)\\\\\\\\n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don\\'t need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSecond, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command\\'s exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor additional information refer to the online Info Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v3r8m2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PIN entry device\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: You will need to sign into the documentation portal with your IBM Registration ID and password.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.5068,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2c3acf8d\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2c3acf8d-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/2c3acf8d.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"FIXES ARE AVAILABLE\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"FIXES ARE AVAILABLE\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower XML Security Gateway version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034955]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower B2B Appliance version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034956]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Integration Appliance version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034957]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Low Latency Appliance version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034958]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Service Gateway version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034959]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Service Gateway version 6.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036407]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower B2B Appliance version 6.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036409]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Integration Appliance version 6.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036410]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Service Gateway version 7.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037486]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower B2B Appliance version 7.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037487]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Integration Appliance version 7.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037488]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Gateway version 7.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038524]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Gateway version 7.2 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039783]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\\\\\\\\nYou can track all active APARs for this component.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR STATUS\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nERROR DESCRIPTION\\\\\\\\n *  Affected are customers sending HTTP GET requests to the\\\\\\\\n   multiprotocol gateway, web service proxy or web application\\\\\\\\n   firewall service.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   With the present implementation, users may end up in a state\\\\\\\\n   with indefinite retries for HTTP GET requests as long as\\\\\\\\n   DataPower has at least one live persistent connection to the\\\\\\\\n   backend server. After timeout interval for active connection it\\\\\\\\n   will terminate the connection and retry using remaining\\\\\\\\n   persistent connections to the backend. (If a new connection is\\\\\\\\n   opened because of half-dead backend this can continue\\\\\\\\n   indefinitely or until the request is served).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLOCAL FIX\\\\\\\\n *  This behavior cannot be turned off however it can be mitigated.\\\\\\\\n   For some relief out of this, the admin can lower the Back\\\\\\\\n   Persistent Timeout and/or User Agent\\'s default Timeout. This\\\\\\\\n   should result in less persistent connections to the backend and\\\\\\\\n   thus less possible timeout hops\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Dropping the backend persistent connections option is also a\\\\\\\\n   possible workaround, but the consequences should be weighed\\\\\\\\n   carefully before making this decision. Not using persistent\\\\\\\\n   connections comes with a performance penalty, but it very much\\\\\\\\n   depends on the size/type of the transferred data and the\\\\\\\\n   speed/ping of the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   SLM is also strongly encouraged to prevent the backend from\\\\\\\\n   getting more load than it can handle.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\\\\\\\\n *  Affected are all customers using the Multi-Protocol Gateway,\\\\\\\\n   Web Service Proxy or Web Application Firewall with persistent\\\\\\\\n   connection to the backend side.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   In case the backend server stops responding to HTTP GET\\\\\\\\n   requests while there are already some established TCP\\\\\\\\n   connections from the time the server worked OK, DataPower will\\\\\\\\n   automatically retry those GET requests after a timeout period.\\\\\\\\n   This will be retried until there are no established connections\\\\\\\\n   to the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   During a high load window, these unwanted retries might\\\\\\\\n   eventually keep flooding an already congested backend,\\\\\\\\n   especially if it is still able to establish some new\\\\\\\\n   connections.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\\\\\\\\n *  Fix is available in 6.0.0.16, 6.0.1.12, 7.0.0.9, 7.1.0.6 and\\\\\\\\n   7.2.0.2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   For a list of the latest fix packs available, please see:\\\\\\\\n   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21237631 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21237631]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTEMPORARY FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCOMMENTS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * APAR NUMBER\\\\\\\\n   IT08971\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   DATAPOWER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   DP1234567\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED RELEASE\\\\\\\\n   600\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * STATUS\\\\\\\\n   CLOSED PER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * PE\\\\\\\\n   NoPE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * HIPER\\\\\\\\n   NoHIPER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\\\\\\\\n   NoSpecatt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SUBMITTED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2015-05-18\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2015-08-12\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2015-09-02\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFIX INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   DATAPOWER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   DP1234567\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\\\\\\\\n * R600 PSN\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * R601 PSN\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * R602 PSN\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * R700 PSN\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * R710 PSN\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * R720 PSN\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.677,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e3bb9a38\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e3bb9a38-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/e3bb9a38.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"SUBSCRIBE TO THIS APAR\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"SUBSCRIBE TO THIS APAR\\\\\\\\nBy subscribing, you receive periodic emails alerting you to the status of the APAR, along with a link to the fix after it becomes available.

The \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default route\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is created by setting the Default Gateway of an interface on a DataPower appliance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA default route will be used if a known route does not exist for a given destination address. If multiple default routes are configured, the appliance will randomly pick which interface to use for outbound traffic if a more specific route cannot be found.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want your network traffic to follow a specific route, set a static route and NOT rely on the default gateway. As a general rule, the management interface should not have the default gateway set, as you generally want to restrict the connections that can be made through that interface.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA general recommendation is to set specific static routes and only ONE default gateway that will catch all traffic not being directed by the static routes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConsider the following example after running this command from the CLI:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nxs40# show route\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndestination interface gateway metric 0.0.0.0/0 eth0 167.91.8.1 0 0.0.0.0/0 eth1 167.91.7.1 0 0.0.0.0/0 mgt0 10.238.77.1 0 10.238.77.0/24 mgt0 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21249208&amp;aid=1] 0 167.81.18.0/23 eth0 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21249208&amp;aid=1] 0 167.81.18.0/23 eth1 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21249208&amp;aid=1] 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe output above shows that three default gateways were configured on eth0, eth1, and mgt0 which causes three \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\" route to be generated (0.0.0.0/0). If the destination address of your service is 166.84.23.4, the device will randomly choose any one of the default routes as no specific route is configured. If, for example, the gateway picked is 10.238.77.1 and the gateway does not know how to route to the needed backend server ip address, this will cause unexpected connection failures. In the case of such failure, a reboot of the device will lead to a different route to be randomly picked, thus temporarily resolving until the next failure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirmware 3.7.2 and later\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInstructions for setting the default gateway and for setting a static route can be found in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Managing the appliance\\\\\\\\\\\\\" section of the Administrators Guide. The command line commands are ip default-gateway and ip route respectively, and more information is available in the CLI Reference Guide.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirmware earlier than 3.7.2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInstructions for setting the default gateway and static routes can be found in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ethernet Interface\\\\\\\\\\\\\" appendix of the WebGUI Guide. The command line commands are ip default-gateway and ip route respectively, and more information is available in the CLI Reference Guide.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo access product documentation, see these instructions.

If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don\\'t need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :-\\n    23→\\n    24→First, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization).\\n    25→\\n    26→Second, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command\\'s exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable.\\n    27→\\n    28→Finally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command).\\n    29→\\n    30→Once all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import.\\n    31→\\n    32→Note that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time.\\n    33→\\n    34→For additional information refer to the online Info Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v3r8m2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for \"PIN entry device\".\\n    35→\\n    36→Note: You will need to sign into the documentation portal with your IBM Registration ID and password.\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

My IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 client licenses are expiring. I have purchased IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 client software and licenses, but I am afraid my version 23.0 licenses will expire before I complete my client migrations to Statistics 24.0. How can I keep my end users up and running throughout the migration?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCAUSE\\\\\\\\nLicense for version N expires before all clients can be upgraded to client software version N+1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nStarting in IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 we have added what we colloquially call \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1 Licensing\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for this exact problem. Simply put, your Statistics version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will use client licenses for Statistics version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImagine the above scenario. You have IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 clients deployed and the license period is coming to an end. Your licenses for Statistics 23.0 will expire long before you complete the upgrade of all clients to Statistics 24.0. The solution is to go ahead and deploy your Statistics 24.0 licenses. Statistics 23.0 (version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N\\\\\\\\\\\\\") will use a Statistics 24.0 (version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1\\\\\\\\\\\\\") license.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is true for Authorized User licensing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is true for Concurrent User licensing - though as a solution, it really is more suited to this method.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCAVEATS:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1) If you are deploying multiple license strings (e.g. A \\'base\\' license plus one or more add-on licenses) the \\'base\\' and \\'add-on\\' license versions must match.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n For example: You have IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 client installed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou CAN add a version 23.0 IBM SPSS Statistics Advanced Statistics module to your version 23.0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"IBM SPSS Statistics Base\\\\\\\\\\\\\" installation\\\\\\\\nYou CANNOT add a version 24.0 IBM SPSS Statistics Advanced Statistics module to your version 23.0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"IBM SPSS Statistics Base\\\\\\\\\\\\\" installation license.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou CAN add a version 24.0 IBM SPSS Statistics Advanced Statistics module to your version 24.0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"IBM SPSS Statistics Base\\\\\\\\\\\\\" installation license.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1 Licensing\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will not work with Commuter License tokens. IBM SPSS Statistics version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N\\\\\\\\\\\\\" can use an IBM SPSS Statistics \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Concurrent User license token.

Immediately following the log of the MIXED command in the output viewer is the message:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\" _ASSERT(qfirst) failed in mxceff \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis message is followed by some messages regarding resources used and the following termination message:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Warnings\\\\\\\\nUndefined error #91 - Cannot open text file \\\\\\\\\\\\\"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\SPSSInc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\PASWStatistics18\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\en\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\spss.err\\\\\\\\\\\\\": No such file or directory\\\\\\\\nThis is an error from which Statistics cannot recover.\\\\\\\\nThe Statistics run will terminate now.\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA colleague has run the same analysis with the same data set on his own computer and not encountered the error. What does the message mean and why is the crash triggered on my computer?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\\\\\\\nA program defect was filed with SPSS Development. Technical Support was unable to replicate the crash. SPSS Development was able to trigger ASSERT_ warnings with program crashes by renaming the spss.err file that was mentioned in the later part of your error messages. They have made program changes to avoid such crashes in the future. However, they were unable to replicate the error in the context of running the customer\\'s MIXED syntax on the customer\\'s data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe customer has since reported that all of the computers involved in these crashes had Iolo System Mechanic Professional installed. Subsequent runs of the same analysis on computers without System Mechanic ran without error messages or crashes. Users that experience system crashes with the message:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_ASSERT(qfirst) failed in mxceff\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nshould examine the computer to see if Iolo System Mechanic is installed. If so, try the analysis on a computer without System Mechanic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Need more help? Our Statistics forum is Live!

My IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 client licenses are expiring. I have purchased IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 client software and licenses, but I am afraid my version 23.0 licenses will expire before I complete my client migrations to Statistics 24.0. How can I keep my end users up and running throughout the migration?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCAUSE\\\\\\\\nLicense for version N expires before all clients can be upgraded to client software version N+1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nStarting in IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 we have added what we colloquially call \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1 Licensing\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for this exact problem. Simply put, your Statistics version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will use client licenses for Statistics version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImagine the above scenario. You have IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 clients deployed and the license period is coming to an end. Your licenses for Statistics 23.0 will expire long before you complete the upgrade of all clients to Statistics 24.0. The solution is to go ahead and deploy your Statistics 24.0 licenses. Statistics 23.0 (version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N\\\\\\\\\\\\\") will use a Statistics 24.0 (version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1\\\\\\\\\\\\\") license.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is true for Authorized User licensing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is true for Concurrent User licensing - though as a solution, it really is more suited to this method.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCAVEATS:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1) If you are deploying multiple license strings (e.g. A \\'base\\' license plus one or more add-on licenses) the \\'base\\' and \\'add-on\\' license versions must match.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n For example: You have IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 client installed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou CAN add a version 23.0 IBM SPSS Statistics Advanced Statistics module to your version 23.0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"IBM SPSS Statistics Base\\\\\\\\\\\\\" installation\\\\\\\\nYou CANNOT add a version 24.0 IBM SPSS Statistics Advanced Statistics module to your version 23.0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"IBM SPSS Statistics Base\\\\\\\\\\\\\" installation license.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou CAN add a version 24.0 IBM SPSS Statistics Advanced Statistics module to your version 24.0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"IBM SPSS Statistics Base\\\\\\\\\\\\\" installation license.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1 Licensing\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will not work with Commuter License tokens. IBM SPSS Statistics version \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N\\\\\\\\\\\\\" can use an IBM SPSS Statistics \\\\\\\\\\\\\"N+1\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Concurrent User license token. However, it cannot use the same as a Commuter license token.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Need more help? Our Statistics forum is Live!

MQ version 7.0 introduced a new feature, conversation sharing. Are there any special values on DataPower when configuring conversation sharing?", "status": "passed", "elapsed_seconds": 371.4714186191559, "cost_usd": 0.22946324999999998, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 2725, "answer": "Based on the retrieved documentation, here's the answer to your question about conversation sharing in DataPower MQ queue managers:\n\n## When to Use Conversation Sharing in DataPower MQ Queue Managers\n\n**Background**: MQ version 7.0 introduced the SHARECNV (sharing conversations) feature, which allows multiple conversations to share a single TCP/IP channel instance. DataPower can configure this feature since it uses client connections with the queue manager SVRCONN channel.\n\n### Three Use Cases for Configuration:\n\n**Case #1: Negotiated value = 0 (Disable sharing conversations)**\n- Channel runs in MQ V6 compatibility mode\n- Does NOT support: Administrator stop-quiesce, Heartbeating, Read ahead, Client asynchronous consume\n- **Configuration**: Set Sharing Conversations to 0 or 1 in DataPower mq-qm object\n- **When to use**: For DataPower firmware 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier (required to avoid device reload/hang)\n\n**Case #2: Negotiated value = 1 (Single conversation with MQ V7 features)**\n- Supports MQ V7+ features but each TCP/IP channel instance has only one conversation\n- **Configuration**: Set Sharing Conversations to 1 AND enable \"Share Single Conversation\" attribute in DataPower mq-qm object\n- **When to use**: When processing mixed message sizes - benefits from MQ V7 Read Ahead and new buffer management for MQGET API calls\n- **Available in**: DataPower firmware 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later\n\n**Case #3: Negotiated value = 2 or more (Multiple conversations)**\n- Full MQ V7+ features with multiple conversations per TCP/IP channel instance\n- **Configuration**: Set Sharing Conversations to 2+ in both DataPower mq-qm object and MQ SVRCONN channel\n- **Available in**: DataPower firmware 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later\n- **Recommendation**: Use value of 10 or less and verify empirically\n\n### Special DataPower Values and Considerations:\n\n1. **Default values**: DataPower defaults to 0, while MQ SVRCONN defaults to 10. The lower value takes effect after negotiation.\n\n2. **Special behavior**: In current DataPower firmware, setting Sharing Conversations to 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server (unless \"Share Single Conversation\" is explicitly enabled).\n\n3. **Share Single Conversation attribute**: Only visible when Sharing Conversations = 1 and <RETURN> is pressed. Hidden for values > 1.\n\n4. **Performance note**: Using SHARECNV(10) is 15% slower than SHARECNV(0) on average. Since DataPower uses connection pooling, there are generally no additional benefits from sharing conversations except for mixed message size scenarios.\n\n5. **Prerequisites**: Apply APAR IV24821 to MQ server (included in MQ V7.0.1.10+, V7.1.0.3+, V7.5.0.1+, and V8).\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/ba7b5156.md]", "tools_used": ["Read", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/ragbench-techqa/2c3acf8d.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/2ebe0075.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/e266c434.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/14ca129f.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/94098d59.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/ba7b5156.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/46949fb6.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/f5e0ed6c.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["there", "Based", "Process", "Manager", "while", "about", "Support", "DataPower", "Conversation", "sharing", "queue", "managers", "Multiple", "message", "version", "required", "consider", "avoid", "support", "Server", "using", "configuration", "after", "After", "perform", "Document", "available", "object", "CONNECT"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Read", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/ragbench-techqa/2c3acf8d.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/2ebe0075.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/e266c434.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/14ca129f.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/94098d59.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/ba7b5156.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/46949fb6.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/f5e0ed6c.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "judge_score": 2.1, "faithfulness": 0.421, "relevancy": -1, "judge": {"faithfulness": 0.421, "answer_relevancy": -1, "relevancy": -1, "score": 2.1, "reason": "RAGAS: faith=0.42"}, "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "ce65a31f-41d7-4044-91d6-0991acd10f7e", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "preprocess", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "preprocess", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "9c3e40c4-1ec2-4bd4-b4f8-8414d902b079", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about conversation sharing in DataPower MQ queue managers.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_EIxboaNhIz0CUTZC9wEYzF', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'DataPower MQ queue manager conversation sharing version 7.0 special values configuration', 'top_k': 8})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_EIxboaNhIz0CUTZC9wEYzF', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.4606,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ba7b5156\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ba7b5156-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/ba7b5156.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\\\\\\\\n When to enable Sharing Conversations in DataPower MQ Queue Manager (mq-qm) object along with SHARECNV attribute of the MQ SVRCONN channel?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\\\\\\\nIBM WebSphere MQ server version 7.0 and later releases provide sharing conversations (SHARECNV) attribute on SVRCONN channel that specifies the maximum number of conversations that can share each TCP/IP channel instance. This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel.\\\\\\\\nThe default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is\\\\\\\\nnegotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCase #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n· Administrator stop-quiesce\\\\\\\\n· Heartbeating\\\\\\\\n· Read ahead\\\\\\\\n· Client asynchronous consume\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCase #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \\\\\\\\\\\\\"on\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sharing Conversations\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is configured with value of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and then <RETURN> key is entered. For values greater than 1, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Share Single Conversation\\\\\\\\\\\\\" attribute is hidden in the mq-qm object.\\\\\\\\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCase #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn average, processing of messages from client applications is 15 percent slower when using SHARECNV(10) as compared to SHARECNV(0). Please refer to Performance Implications of Sharing [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm]\\\\\\\\nConversations on Client-connection Channels. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server\\'s allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] (\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread\\\\\\\\\\\\\") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server. IV24821 is included in IBM WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.10 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.1.0.3 and later, IBM WebSphere MQ V7.5.0.1 and later, and IBM WebSphere MQ V8.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to identify

who have established a remote connection\\\\\\\\n   to a Queue Manager via a channel that has Conversation Sharing\\\\\\\\n   disabled (SHARECNV=0 or SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   This includes users of:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Classes for JMS\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Resource Adapter.\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere Application Server V7.0 and V8.0 WebSphere MQ\\\\\\\\n   messaging provider.\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere Application Server V6.1 WebSphere MQ messaging\\\\\\\\n   provider who have configured the WebSphere variable\\\\\\\\n   MQ_INSTALL_ROOT to point to a WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 installation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Platforms affected:\\\\\\\\n   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)\\\\\\\\n   ****************************************************************\\\\\\\\n   PROBLEM SUMMARY:\\\\\\\\n   By default in the WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS,\\\\\\\\n   conversation\\\\\\\\n   sharing is enabled and set to 10 on the client side. The client\\\\\\\\n   only discovers that Conversation Sharing is disabled following\\\\\\\\n   negotiation with a Queue Manager on the completion of a\\\\\\\\n   connection over a Channel that has SHARECNV=0 or SHARECNV=1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   When a WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS application requests a\\\\\\\\n   remote connection to a Queue Manager the client first attempts\\\\\\\\n   to find an already established TCP/IP connection which can be\\\\\\\\n   shared. As part of this process the list of known TCP/IP\\\\\\\\n   connections are matched for their suitability, this list\\\\\\\\n   includes connections which are in the process of being\\\\\\\\n   established (MQCONN reply not received from the Queue Manager).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   When a WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS application requested a\\\\\\\\n   remote connection it was matched for sharing with a connection\\\\\\\\n   that was still in the process of being established. The\\\\\\\\n   WebSphere MQ Client waited for the connection to complete and\\\\\\\\n   due to a small timing window began incorrectly sharing the\\\\\\\\n   connection without confirming the connection\\'s suitability. If\\\\\\\\n   the connection\\'s suitability had been checked then the\\\\\\\\n   connection\\\\\\\\n   would have been marked unsuitable due to the Negotiated Channel\\\\\\\\n   specifying that Conversation Sharing was disabled (SHARECNV=0 or\\\\\\\\n   SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n   As the connection (which did not support conversation sharing)\\\\\\\\n   was now shared by two threads, packets destined for one thread\\\\\\\\n   were erroneously received by the other, this led to the client\\\\\\\\n   being in an inconsistent state and the two FDCs being generated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\\\\\\\\n *  The WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS have been modified to\\\\\\\\n   correctly restrict conversation sharing when using a connection\\\\\\\\n   that does not support conversation sharing (SHARECNV=0 or\\\\\\\\n   SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n

instance sharing conversations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLOCAL FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\\\\\\\\n *  ****************************************************************\\\\\\\\n   USERS AFFECTED:\\\\\\\\n   Users with security exits defined in client channels that will\\\\\\\\n   use sharing conversations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Platforms affected:\\\\\\\\n   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)\\\\\\\\n   ****************************************************************\\\\\\\\n   PROBLEM SUMMARY:\\\\\\\\n   When a client channel instance is shared by more than one\\\\\\\\n   conversation, the pattern of calls to the security exit is\\\\\\\\n   restricted on the second and subsequent conversations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   These restrictions should be documented in the WebSphere MQ\\\\\\\\n   product manuals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\\\\\\\\n *  The following description will be added to the\\\\\\\\n   Intercommunication manual on the page that describes Channel\\\\\\\\n   security exit programs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   When a client channel instance is shared by more than one\\\\\\\\n   conversation, the pattern of calls to the security exit is\\\\\\\\n   restricted on the second and subsequent conversations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   For the first conversation, the pattern is the same as if the\\\\\\\\n   channel were not sharing conversations.  For the second and\\\\\\\\n   subsequent conversations, the security exit is never called with\\\\\\\\n   MQXR_INIT, MQXR_INIT_SEC, or MQXR_SEC_MSG.  It is called with\\\\\\\\n   MQXR_SEC_PARMS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   In a channel that is sharing conversations, MQXR_TERM is called\\\\\\\\n   only for the last conversation running.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Each conversation has the opportunity in the MQXR_SEC_PARMS\\\\\\\\n   invocation of the exit to alter the MQCD; on the\\\\\\\\n   server-connection end of the channel this can be useful to vary,\\\\\\\\n   for example, the MCAUserIdentifier or LongMCAUserIdPtr values\\\\\\\\n   before the connection is made to the queue manager.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTEMPORARY FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCOMMENTS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * APAR NUMBER\\\\\\\\n   IZ33379\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   WMQ AIX V7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   5724H7221\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED RELEASE\\\\\\\\n   700\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * STATUS\\\\\\\\n   CLOSED DOC\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * PE\\\\\\\\n   NoPE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * HIPER\\\\\\\\n   NoHIPER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\\\\\\\\n   NoSpecatt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SUBMITTED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2008-09-25\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2008-10-31\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2008-10-31\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFIX INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.2514,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2c3acf8d\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2c3acf8d-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/2c3acf8d.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"FIXES ARE AVAILABLE\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"FIXES ARE AVAILABLE\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower XML Security Gateway version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034955]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower B2B Appliance version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034956]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Integration Appliance version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034957]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Low Latency Appliance version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034958]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Service Gateway version 6.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034959]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Service Gateway version 6.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036407]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower B2B Appliance version 6.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036409]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Integration Appliance version 6.0.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24036410]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Service Gateway version 7.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037486]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower B2B Appliance version 7.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037487]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Integration Appliance version 7.0 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037488]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Gateway version 7.1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038524]\\\\\\\\nFix packs for DataPower Gateway version 7.2 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039783]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\\\\\\\\nYou can track all active APARs for this component.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR STATUS\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nERROR DESCRIPTION\\\\\\\\n *  Affected are customers sending HTTP GET requests to the\\\\\\\\n   multiprotocol gateway, web service proxy or web application\\\\\\\\n   firewall service.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   With the present implementation, users may end up in a state\\\\\\\\n   with indefinite retries for HTTP GET requests as long as\\\\\\\\n   DataPower has at least one live persistent connection to the\\\\\\\\n   backend server. After timeout interval for active connection it\\\\\\\\n   will terminate the connection and retry using remaining\\\\\\\\n   persistent connections to the backend. (If a new connection is\\\\\\\\n   opened because of half-dead backend this can continue\\\\\\\\n   indefinitely or until the request is served).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLOCAL FIX\\\\\\\\n *  This behavior cannot be turned off however it can be mitigated.\\\\\\\\n   For some relief out of this, the admin can lower the Back\\\\\\\\n   Persistent Timeout and/or User Agent\\'s default Timeout. This\\\\\\\\n   should result in less persistent connections to the backend and\\\\\\\\n   thus less possible timeout hops\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Dropping the backend persistent connections option is also a\\\\\\\\n   possible workaround, but the consequences should be weighed\\\\\\\\n   carefully before making this decision. Not using persistent\\\\\\\\n   connections comes with a performance penalty, but it very much\\\\\\\\n   depends on the size/type of the transferred data and the\\\\\\\\n   speed/ping of the network.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   SLM is also strongly encouraged to prevent the backend from\\\\\\\\n   getting more load than it can handle.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\\\\\\\\n *  Affected are all customers using the Multi-Protocol Gateway,\\\\\\\\n   Web Service Proxy or Web Application Firewall with persistent\\\\\\\\n   connection to the backend side.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   In case the backend server stops responding to HTTP GET\\\\\\\\n   requests while there are already some established TCP\\\\\\\\n   connections from the time the server worked OK, DataPower will\\\\\\\\n   automatically retry those GET requests after a timeout period.\\\\\\\\n   This will be retried until there are no established connections\\\\\\\\n   to the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   During a high load window, these unwanted retries might\\\\\\\\n   eventually keep flooding an already congested backend,\\\\\\\\n   especially if it is still able to establish some new\\\\\\\\n   connections.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\\\\\\\\n *

This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel.\\n    17→The default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is\\n    18→negotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\\n    19→\\n    20→There are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object:\\n    21→\\n    22→Case #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\\n    23→\\n    24→· Administrator stop-quiesce\\n    25→· Heartbeating\\n    26→· Read ahead\\n    27→· Client asynchronous consume\\n    28→\\n    29→Set a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\n    30→\\n    31→Case #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.\\n    32→\\n    33→Set a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \"on\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\n    34→\\n    35→The Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when \"Sharing Conversations\" is configured with value of \"1\" and then <RETURN> key is entered. For values greater than 1, the \"Share Single Conversation\" attribute is hidden in the mq-qm object.\\n    36→[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1]\\n    37→\\n    38→Case #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.\\n    39→\\n    40→Set a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.\\n    41→\\n    42→On average, processing of messages from client applications is 15 percent slower when using SHARECNV(10) as compared to SHARECNV(0). Please refer to Performance Implications of Sharing [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm]\\n    43→Conversations on Client-connection Channels. [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm].\\n    44→\\n    45→Since DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\\n    46→\\n    47→When using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server\\'s allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\\n    48→\\n    49→For DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059.\\n    50→\\n    51→Cases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.\\n    52→\\n    53→Note: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] (\"Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread\") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server.

WSVR0605W warnings are thrown in the log files and traces.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSYMPTOM\\\\\\\\nMessage processing, that is related to event-sequenced operations, stops. After handling several messages, further messages wait in the Service Component Architecture (SCA) bus queues and event-sequenced es-workmanager hung-thread WSVR0605W warnings are seen in the log files and traces. The entire process of event-sequenced messages in the system is effectively blocked.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following code is an example of an es-workmanager hung-thread warning:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[01/01/11 12:00:37:844 CEST] 0000000d ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread \\\\\\\\\\\\\"WorkManager.es-workmanager : 9\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (0000012e) has been active for 602495 milliseconds and may be hung.

This event-sequencing thread pool is named \\\\\\\\\\\\\"es-workmanager,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by default, and it is configured during the profile creation process. The startWork method behavior is that the method is blocked until the work is placed in the thread pool and then returned. The work is later run asynchronously. If there are not enough threads available in the es-workmanager thread pool, the startWork call to the work manager is blocked indefinitely and the WSVR0605W es-workmanager hung-thread warnings are thrown. With each warning, the number of blocked threads increases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\\\\\\\nTo resolve the problem, you must tune the thread pool size for the es-workmanager thread pool. By default, the es-workmanager thread pool is created with a minimum of 2 threads and a maximum of 20 threads. Also, the Growable option is set to true, which means that the number of threads can go beyond the maximum, if needed. When the defaults are used, this issue should not happen because the thread pool can grow, if necessary. However, in certain situations, it might be necessary to limit and tune the maximum thread pool size. In these situations, individual performance tuning is necessary to prevent blocked threads. You can tune es-workmanager thread-pool properties in a pre-production test environment to avoid performance problems on a production server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can access the configuration for work managers in the administrative console under Resources > Asynchronous beans > Work managers > es-workmanager. The task of configuring work managers is also described in the Configuring work managers [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/asyncbns/tasks/tasb_workmanager.html] topic within the information center:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n#WebSphere Process Server V7.0 Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.wps.doc/welcome_wps.html]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\\\\\\\\n WPS\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.795,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"14ca129f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"14ca129f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/14ca129f.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"A FIX IS AVAILABLE\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A FIX IS AVAILABLE\\\\\\\\nWebSphere MQ V7.0 Fix Pack 7.0.1.12 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037169]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\\\\\\\\nYou can track all active APARs for this component.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR STATUS\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nERROR DESCRIPTION\\\\\\\\n *  WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS V7.0.1.5 (or later): Failure\\\\\\\\n   Data Capture (FDC) files\\\\\\\\n   with Probe\\\\\\\\n   ID JO076001 and JO205001 are generated following a remote\\\\\\\\n   connection to a Queue Manager that has conversation sharing\\\\\\\\n   disabled:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   | Probe Id     :- JO076001\\\\\\\\n   | Component    :- RemoteFAP.MQOPEN(Hconn,MQOD,int,Phobj,Pi\\\\\\\\n   | Probe Type   :- INCORROUT\\\\\\\\n   | Comment1     :- MQOPEN reply expected\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   | Probe Id     :- JO205001\\\\\\\\n   | Component    :- RemoteConnection.removeHconn(RemoteTls,R\\\\\\\\n   | Probe Type   :- INCORROUT\\\\\\\\n   | Comment1     :- Hconn is not associated with this connection\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLOCAL FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\\\\\\\\n *  ****************************************************************\\\\\\\\n   USERS AFFECTED:\\\\\\\\n   This issue affects users of the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.5 Classes\\\\\\\\n   for Java/JMS (or later) who have established a remote connection\\\\\\\\n   to a Queue Manager via a channel that has Conversation Sharing\\\\\\\\n   disabled (SHARECNV=0 or SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   This includes users of:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Classes for JMS\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Resource Adapter.\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere Application Server V7.0 and V8.0 WebSphere MQ\\\\\\\\n   messaging provider.\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere Application Server V6.1 WebSphere MQ messaging\\\\\\\\n   provider who have configured the WebSphere variable\\\\\\\\n   MQ_INSTALL_ROOT to point to a WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 installation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Platforms affected:\\\\\\\\n   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)\\\\\\\\n   ****************************************************************\\\\\\\\n   PROBLEM SUMMARY:\\\\\\\\n   By default in the WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS,\\\\\\\\n   conversation\\\\\\\\n   sharing is enabled and set to 10 on the client side. The client\\\\\\\\n   only discovers that Conversation Sharing is disabled following\\\\\\\\n   negotiation with a Queue Manager on the completion of a\\\\\\\\n   connection over a Channel that has SHARECNV=0 or SHARECNV=1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   When a WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS application requests a\\\\\\\\n   remote connection to a Queue Manager the client first attempts\\\\\\\\n   to find an already established TCP/IP connection which can be\\\\\\\\n   shared. As part of this process the list of known TCP/IP\\\\\\\\n   connections are matched for their suitability, this list\\\\\\\\n   includes connections which are in the process of being\\\\\\\\n   established (MQCONN reply not received from the Queue Manager).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   When a WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS application requested a\\\\\\\\n   remote connection it was matched for sharing with a connection\\\\\\\\n   that was still in the process of being established. The\\\\\\\\n   WebSphere MQ Client waited for the connection to complete and\\\\\\\\n   due to a small timing window began incorrectly sharing the\\\\\\\\n   connection without confirming the connection\\'s suitability. If\\\\\\\\n   the connection\\'s suitability had been checked then the\\\\\\\\n   connection\\\\\\\\n   would have been marked unsuitable due to the Negotiated Channel\\\\\\\\n   specifying that Conversation Sharing was disabled (SHARECNV=0 or\\\\\\\\n   SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n   As the connection (which did not support conversation sharing)\\\\\\\\n   was now shared by two threads, packets destined for one thread\\\\\\\\n   were erroneously received by the other, this led to the client\\\\\\\\n   being in an inconsistent state and the two FDCs being generated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\\\\\\\\n *  The WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS have been modified to\\\\\\\\n   correctly restrict conversation sharing when using a connection\\\\\\\\n   that does not support conversation sharing (SHARECNV=0 or\\\\\\\\n   SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Version    Maintenance Level\\\\\\\\n   v7.0       7.0.1.12\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   The latest available maintenance can be obtained from\\\\\\\\n   \\'WebSphere MQ Recommended Fixes\\'\\\\\\\\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   If the maintenance level is not yet available information on\\\\\\\\n   its planned availability can be found in \\'WebSphere MQ\\\\\\\\n   Planned Maintenance Release Dates\\'\\\\\\\\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309]\\\\\\\\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTEMPORARY FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCOMMENTS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * APAR NUMBER\\\\\\\\n   IV47785\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   WMQ HP V7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   5724H7222\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED RELEASE\\\\\\\\n   701\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * STATUS\\\\\\\\n   CLOSED PER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * PE\\\\\\\\n   NoPE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * HIPER\\\\\\\\n   NoHIPER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\\\\\\\\n   NoSpecatt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SUBMITTED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2013-09-02\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2013-09-26\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2014-01-13\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFIX INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   WMQ HP V7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   5724H7222\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\\\\\\\\n * R701 PSY\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.019,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20ca14b9\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20ca14b9-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/20ca14b9.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\\\\\\\\n Your WebSphere Message Broker (WMB) message flow hangs.

The client\\\\\\\\n   only discovers that Conversation Sharing is disabled following\\\\\\\\n   negotiation with a Queue Manager on the completion of a\\\\\\\\n   connection over a Channel that has SHARECNV=0 or SHARECNV=1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   When a WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS application requests a\\\\\\\\n   remote connection to a Queue Manager the client first attempts\\\\\\\\n   to find an already established TCP/IP connection which can be\\\\\\\\n   shared. As part of this process the list of known TCP/IP\\\\\\\\n   connections are matched for their suitability, this list\\\\\\\\n   includes connections which are in the process of being\\\\\\\\n   established (MQCONN reply not received from the Queue Manager).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   When a WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS application requested a\\\\\\\\n   remote connection it was matched for sharing with a connection\\\\\\\\n   that was still in the process of being established. The\\\\\\\\n   WebSphere MQ Client waited for the connection to complete and\\\\\\\\n   due to a small timing window began incorrectly sharing the\\\\\\\\n   connection without confirming the connection\\'s suitability. If\\\\\\\\n   the connection\\'s suitability had been checked then the\\\\\\\\n   connection\\\\\\\\n   would have been marked unsuitable due to the Negotiated Channel\\\\\\\\n   specifying that Conversation Sharing was disabled (SHARECNV=0 or\\\\\\\\n   SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n   As the connection (which did not support conversation sharing)\\\\\\\\n   was now shared by two threads, packets destined for one thread\\\\\\\\n   were erroneously received by the other, this led to the client\\\\\\\\n   being in an inconsistent state and the two FDCs being generated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\\\\\\\\n *  The WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS have been modified to\\\\\\\\n   correctly restrict conversation sharing when using a connection\\\\\\\\n   that does not support conversation sharing (SHARECNV=0 or\\\\\\\\n   SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Version    Maintenance Level\\\\\\\\n   v7.0       7.0.1.12\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   The latest available maintenance can be obtained from\\\\\\\\n   \\'WebSphere MQ Recommended Fixes\\'\\\\\\\\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   If the maintenance level is not yet available information on\\\\\\\\n   its planned availability can be found in \\'WebSphere MQ\\\\\\\\n   Planned Maintenance Release Dates\\'\\\\\\\\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309]\\\\\\\\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTEMPORARY FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCOMMENTS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * APAR NUMBER\\\\\\\\n   IV47785\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   WMQ HP V7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   5724H7222\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED RELEASE\\\\\\\\n   701\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * STATUS\\\\\\\\n   CLOSED PER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * PE\\\\\\\\n   NoPE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * HIPER\\\\\\\\n   NoHIPER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\\\\\\\\n   NoSpecatt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SUBMITTED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2013-09-02\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2013-09-26\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2014-01-13\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFIX INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   WMQ HP V7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   5724H7222\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\\\\\\\\n * R701 PSY\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.2514,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"11991e77\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"11991e77-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/11991e77.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"NEWS\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"NEWS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nABSTRACT\\\\\\\\n The WebSphere MQ (WMQ) Support Portal page has been replaced by the IBM MQ Support Portal page.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCONTENT\\\\\\\\nThe WebSphere MQ product name was changed to IBM MQ starting with v8. Now that v9 has been available for a while, we have renamed the IBM Support Portal page for MQ from WebSphere MQ to IBM MQ. You will find content for all versions of MQ on the new IBM MQ Support Portal page [https://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/websphere/ibm_mq].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have bookmarks or links to the old WebSphere MQ Support Portal page, you should update them to point to the new IBM MQ Support Portal page. We have put redirects in place to handle most forms of the old WebSphere MQ URL, but there are some variants that might not properly redirect to the new IBM MQ page. To avoid any problems with the URL redirect process, we recommend that you update your bookmarks and links to the new IBM MQ Support Portal page:https://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/websphere/ibm_mq [https://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/product/websphere/ibm_mq]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can search for MQ, IBM MQ, or WebSphere MQ from the main IBM Support Portal page [https://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/support]. You will see the choice to select IBM MQ. You will not see \\\\\\\\\\\\\"WebSphere MQ\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the search results since it has been replaced by the IBM MQ Support Portal page.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo receive notifications for MQ content, make sure your My Notifications subscriptions also include IBM MQ. Keep WebSphere MQ active as well, since the transition phase for our documents will take some time and you will want to receive notifications for both IBM MQ and WebSphere MQ documents.

This would then cause a potential loss\\\\\\\\n   of data due to how WLM handled the uncompressed bytes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Although it is not recommended, the compression optimizations\\\\\\\\n   can be removed and the code reverted back to the prior code if\\\\\\\\n   problems are seen by setting a cell level custom property:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   In the administrative console, go to the Custom properties\\\\\\\\n   page for the cell.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   System administration > Cell >  cell_name, and then, under\\\\\\\\n   Additional Properties, click Custom Properties\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Create a new custom property with a name of:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   IBM_CLUSTER_USE_LEGACY_COMPRESSOR\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   and a value of true.

Can two WebSphere MQ exports or imports point to the same queue?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultiple imports or exports (or applications) using the same queue is not supported. It cannot be guaranteed which one would receive the response. There should be separate queues for each import and export.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne Import/Export per MQ queue configuration is required. This configuration is also true in a golden or silver topology cluster environment. In this environment, the callback queue for the Import is remote from the application and all cluster members have visibility of the callback information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBack to top\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. If WebSphere MQ goes down, would the listener port re-connect to WebSphere MQ automatically when it is available again?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a WebSphere MQ resource goes down within the retry limits (the default is 5 times) then the listeners will reconnect. For example, if you try to put a message once and WebSphere MQ has gone down but then comes up on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th retry, it should reconnect. However, if the retry limit has been reached then after the listeners finish retrying, they are stopped and need to be started again manually.\\\\\\\\nBack to top\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6. How can I dynamically change the JNDI resources for a WebSphere MQ import without the need to re-deploy the application?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow the below steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 1. Log into the administrative console.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 2. Expand the Applications section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 3. Select SCA modules.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 4. Select your module in question.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 5. On the right side of the page, expand imports, find the import you are referring to and select it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 6. Expand \\'Bindings\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 7. Click MQ.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 8. Make changes to the JNDI and click apply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 9. Save.\\\\\\\\n    Back to top\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n7. I am seeing the below exception, what does it mean?\\\\\\\\ncom.ibm.websphere.sca.ServiceRuntimeException: No message is received from callback queue with\\\\\\\\nselector=callbackID=\\'CALLBACKMESSAGE_ID:....\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe previous exception means that an MQ import is receiving a response message for a request that it did not send a request message for.\\\\\\\\nBack to top\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n8. Even though I have received a response for a request that was sent out, I see the error message below. Why am I seeing this error and what are the possible solutions?\\\\\\\\ncom.ibm.websphere.sca.ServiceRuntimeException: No message is received from callback queue with selector=callbackID=\\'CALLBACKMESSAGE_ID:....\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the following process that explains how the MQ/JMS Import works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 1. MQ/JMS Import sends the MQ/JMS Request message and in the same transaction it also puts a correlation message to a Service Integration Bus (SIBus) Queue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 2. MQ/JMS Import response listener receives the MQ/JMS response message off the response queue and, at this point, it attempts to get the correlation message off the SIBus queue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 3. The response listener waits for a maximum of 6 seconds for the correlation message to become available before throwing the exception that you see.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 4. The MQ/JMS response message is then subject to the MQ retry and backout configuration as you have defined.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, a possible cause for this error is a delay in the SIBus message being committed and becoming available. This scenario might be caused by performance issues of the underlying database used by SIBus.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo handle such situations you have the following options:\\\\\\\\n 1. For the MQ/JMS Import, JMS callback destination has the default of persistence (Application). The MQ/JMS Import sends the correlation message as PERSISTENT; therefore, the message is persistent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    MQ/JMS Callback Connection Factory uses the default Quality of Service for persistent, so it maps persistent to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Reliable Persistence\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for SIBus.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    You can try changing this to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Assured Persistent,\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which drives the persistence of the message on the same thread as the commit call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 2. Increase the retry values on the WebSphere MQ backout threshold and listener port to optimum values. In this case, the message is tried more than once before being sent to the backout queue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 3. Tune the database used by SIBus to avoid any performance issue.\\\\\\\\n    Back to top\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9. My listener port is stopping due to an invalid or “bad” message and further processing does not take place. How do I configure the listener port to not stop and continue processing?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese messages are known as poison messages.

useful\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis ACL, short for Access Control List, is the feature that allows certain\\\\\\\\nconnections to be limited in terms of the commands that can be executed and the\\\\\\\\nkeys that can be accessed. The way it works is that, after connecting, a client\\\\\\\\nis required to provide a username and a valid password to authenticate. If authentication succeeded, the connection is associated with a given\\\\\\\\nuser and the limits the user has. Redis can be configured so that new\\\\\\\\nconnections are already authenticated with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\" user (this is the\\\\\\\\ndefault configuration). Configuring the default user has, as a side effect,\\\\\\\\nthe ability to provide only a specific subset of functionalities to connections\\\\\\\\nthat are not explicitly authenticated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the default configuration, Redis 6 (the first version to have ACLs) works\\\\\\\\nexactly like older versions of Redis. Every new connection is\\\\\\\\ncapable of calling every possible command and accessing every key, so the\\\\\\\\nACL feature is backward compatible with old clients and applications. Also\\\\\\\\nthe old way to configure a password, using the **requirepass** configuration\\\\\\\\ndirective, still works as expected. However, it now\\\\\\\\nsets a password for the default user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command was extended in Redis 6, so now it is possible to\\\\\\\\nuse it in the two-arguments form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <username> <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of the old form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat happens is that the username used to authenticate is \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so\\\\\\\\njust specifying the password implies that we want to authenticate against\\\\\\\\nthe default user. This provides backward compatibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore using ACLs, you may want to ask yourself what\\'s the goal you want to\\\\\\\\naccomplish by implementing this layer of protection. Normally there are\\\\\\\\ntwo main goals that are well served by ACLs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You want to improve security by restricting the access to commands and keys, so that untrusted clients have no access and trusted clients have just the minimum access level to the database in order to perform the work needed. For instance, certain clients may just be able to execute read only commands.\\\\\\\\n2. You want to improve operational safety, so that processes or humans accessing Redis are not allowed to damage the data or the configuration due to software errors or manual mistakes. For instance, there is no reason for a worker that fetches delayed jobs from Redis to be able to call the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother typical usage of ACLs is related to managed Redis instances. Redis is\\\\\\\\noften provided as a managed service both by internal company teams that handle\\\\\\\\nthe Redis infrastructure for the other internal customers they have, or is\\\\\\\\nprovided in a software-as-a-service setup by cloud providers. In both \\\\\\\\nsetups, we want to be sure that configuration commands are excluded for the\\\\\\\\ncustomers.\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"agent_hint\\\\\": \\\\\"[overview | gaps:incomplete_steps,missing_example]\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"evidence_flags\\\\\": {\\\\n      \\\\\"has_command\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_config\\\\\": true,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_code_block\\\\\": true,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_steps\\\\\": false\\\\n    }\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.5953,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c924a7c0\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c924a7c0-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 2,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"../my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/install/add-module-to-database.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Add Module To Database\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Module configuration options\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- [RediSearch configuration options]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- [RedisTimeSeries configuration options]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- [RedisBloom configuration options]()\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"agent_hint\\\\\": \\\\\"[guide | gaps:incomplete_steps,missing_command,missing_config,missing_example]\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"evidence_flags\\\\\": {\\\\n      \\\\\"has_command\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_config\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_code_block\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_steps\\\\\": false\\\\n    }\\\\n  }\\\\n]\\\\n\\\\n[SEARCH NOTE] 以上为文档片段（chunks），可能不完整。如果 chunk 内容不足以完整回答问题（缺少具体步骤、命令、配置、代码），请用 Read(path) 读取对应文件获取完整上下文，严禁用通用知识补充。\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='❌ **No relevant documentation found.**\\n\\nI searched the knowledge base extensively for information about dropping/removing users in IBM Cognos Disclosure Management 10.2.4 on AIX 7.1, but the available documents only cover:\\n\\n- Download and installation procedures\\n- Security bulletins (CVE vulnerabilities)\\n- Reference date configuration issues\\n- Product component listings\\n\\nNone of the retrieved documents contain user administration procedures, user management commands, or instructions for dropping users from Cognos Disclosure Management.\\n\\n⚠️ **Recommendation**: For user administration procedures in Cognos Disclosure Management 10.2.4, please refer to the official IBM Cognos Disclosure Management Administration Guide or contact IBM Support directly.')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "❌ **No relevant documentation found.**\n\nI searched the knowledge base extensively for information about dropping/removing users in IBM Cognos Disclosure Management 10.2.4 on AIX 7.1, but the available documents only cover:\n\n- Download and installation procedures\n- Security bulletins (CVE vulnerabilities)\n- Reference date configuration issues\n- Product component listings\n\nNone of the retrieved documents contain user administration procedures, user management commands, or instructions for dropping users from Cognos Disclosure Management.\n\n⚠️ **Recommendation**: For user administration procedures in Cognos Disclosure Management 10.2.4, please refer to the official IBM Cognos Disclosure Management Administration Guide or contact IBM Support directly.", "session_id": "557e8594-978b-4ed7-ae4a-d1c4f5861dcd", "num_turns": 7, "duration_ms": 845474, "total_cost_usd": 0.34937, "usage": {"input_tokens": 31391, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 13184, "cache_read_input_tokens": 190530, "output_tokens": 590, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 13184}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

For maintenance purposes it may be necessary to install fix packs and/or interim fixes for eWAS and IHS.\\\\\\\\nYou can use this procedure to install fix packs and interim fixes for a given eWAS and IHS version, but not to upgrade to a new eWAS or IHS version. For example, you can use it to install eWAS 7.0.0.43 on top of eWAS 7.0.0.29, but you cannot use it to install eWAS version 8.0 on top of eWAS version 7.0.\\\\\\\\nThe following table shows the different levels of eWAS and IHS that are provided by 6.2.3:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nITM version eWAS version IHS version 6.23.05.00 7.0.0.29 7.0.0.00 6.23.03.00 - 6.23.04.00 7.0.0.25 7.0.0.00 6.23.01.00 - 6.23.02.00 7.0.0.19 7.0.0.00 6.23.00.00 7.0.0.15 7.0.0.00\\\\\\\\nThis technote applies specifically to eWAS, not the full version of WebSphere. Further, this technote applies only to V6.2.3 of ITM.\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nFollow these steps to install a new eWAS fix pack into your ITM environment:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 1. Back up your ITM environment.\\\\\\\\nBack up your ITM environment using your local procedures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 2. Download the maintenance installation scripts.\\\\\\\\nDownload the appropriate eWAS/IHS maintenance installation script to the system where your TEPS resides.\\\\\\\\nUnix/Linux: Download ewasihsv7update.sh attached below. Ensure that the script has execute permission after it has been downloaded.\\\\\\\\nls -l ./ewasihsv7update.sh\\\\\\\\nchmod a+rx ./ewasihsv7update.sh\\\\\\\\nWindows: Download ewasihsv7update.cmd attached below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 3. Generate the list of files that need to be downloaded.\\\\\\\\nRun ewasihsv7update.sh or ewasihsv7update.cmd to generate the list of files that need to be downloaded and to create the temporary directory to hold them.\\\\\\\\nWhen the prompt beginning with \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Have all required files been downloaded to\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is displayed,\\\\\\\\nrespond with n to exit the script so that you can download the required files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe usage information for the command follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Unix:\\\\\\\\n   ewasihsv7update.sh [-h candle_directory] [-w working_directory] [-u updateinstaller directory]\\\\\\\\n   -h Fully qualified path of the ITM installation directory.\\\\\\\\n   -w Fully qualified path of the temporary working directory for file downloads.\\\\\\\\n   -u Fully qualified path of the UpdateInstaller installation directory.\\\\\\\\n   If ewasihsv7update.sh was downloaded to CANDLEHOME/bin/, then the -h option is not needed.\\\\\\\\n   The working directory default value is: /tmp/ewasihsv7. You can specify a different location using the -w option.\\\\\\\\n   The -u option should only be used when installation of the UpdateInstaller to the documented default directory is not permitted.  *  AIX Default Location:\\\\\\\\n      /usr/IBM/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller Linux Default Location:\\\\\\\\n      /opt/IBM/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Windows:\\\\\\\\n   ewasihsv7update.cmd [-h candle_directory] [-w working_directory] [-u updateinstaller directory]\\\\\\\\n   -h Fully qualified path of the ITM installation directory.\\\\\\\\n   -w Fully qualified path of the temporary working directory for file downloads.\\\\\\\\n   -u Fully qualified path of the UpdateInstaller installation directory.\\\\\\\\n   The ITM installation directory default value is the %CANDLE_HOME% value retrieved from the shell environment. Normally the -h option is not needed.\\\\\\\\n   The working directory default value is: %TEMP%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ewasihsv7. You can specify a different location using the -w option.\\\\\\\\n   The -u option should only be used when installation of the UpdateInstaller to the documented default directory is not permitted.  * Windows Default Location:\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\IBM\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\WebSphere\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\UpdateInstaller\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 4: Download the files listed in the output from step 3 between the two delimiter lines starting with:\\\\\\\\n<><><><><><><><><><>\\\\\\\\nThere are a number of ways to download the files:  1. If a browser is available on the TEPS system:  * For each file listed between the two delimiter lines in the output from step 3;  * Copy and paste the full line, one at a time, into the browser address bar and then hit enter.\\\\\\\\n        * Save the file to the working directory displayed after the second delimiter line in the output from step 3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 2. If the wget utility is available, in a command prompt on the TEPS system:  * Change directory to the working directory displayed after the second delimiter line in the output from step 3.\\\\\\\\n     * For each file listed between the two delimiter lines in the output from step 3;  * Enter the wget command followed by the copy and paste of the full line, and then hit enter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 3.

See the V.R.M.F Maintenance Stream Delivery Vehicle terminology explanation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] for more details.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModification and fix pack numbers are the third and fourth digits in the IBM product version number, for example: 8.5.M.F.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModification and fix packs include only bug fixes, so they do not affect the product functionality or your data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the following technotes to find out which update your installation need:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Finding the version of ODM product and fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21627850] to determine the exact product versions that are installed on your machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Find the version of ODM components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738] to determine the exact module or library versions that are deployed on your servers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] to learn about the latest modification or fix pack that is available for your product version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * IBM Operational Decision Manager detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023067] to verify that your configuration is supported with your current product version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] to verify that your current version does not reach end of support in the near future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReferring to the last two documents above, you may find out that you need to migrate to the latest product version to ensure continued support of your applications. In that case, refer to technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat being said, make sure to consider migrating to the latest version or release ( V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from the latest added features and improvements.\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nAs with any software product, even if you do not have any issues with running your current configuration, you should apply the latest modification or fix pack to take advantage of these benefits:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Anticipate and avoid the risk of encountering defects already fixed.\\\\\\\\n * Apply the latest product improvements that are available (performance, for example).\\\\\\\\n * Maintain a serviceable system and be able to install an interim fix when required.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWHEN TO UPDATE\\\\\\\\nThe latest modification or fix pack should be installed as soon as it is available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can subscribe to the IBM Support My Notifications [https://www.ibm.com/support/mynotifications] to be notified of any fix pack releases, and you can also bookmark the Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] page, which lists the latest modifications or fix packs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the technote Fix pack release notification for Operational Decision Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593] to find out when a modification or fix pack will be available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBEFORE UPDATING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe databases used in the sample server are deleted and recreated during the update. If you are using those databases and want to save the existing content, perform the following steps before updating:\\\\\\\\n *  Stop the sample server. In the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby, create an archive file containing the resdb and rtsdb folders. Save the archive file, such as zip file, in the data folder. After installation, unzip the archive file in the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby to restore your databases before restarting the sample server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA new profile is also created for the sample server, at the first server start following the installation of a modification or fix pack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to continue using the same ports, you must delete the existing profile prior. In the <ODM_HOME>/shared/bin folder, from the command line, run the command ../tools/ant/bin/ant forcedestroyprofile.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: The sample server is not designed to be used in a production system. For a production system, you must create a dedicated profile and database that you update using the following steps.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach modification or fix pack page provides instructions on how to download and run the installer, in addition to providing a list of corrections that are included in the update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fix pack installation updates the following files and folders:  * JAR libraries in the installation directories, including <ODMInstallDir>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<Module>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lib.\\\\\\\\n * EAR and WAR applications in the <ODMInstallDir>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<Module>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\applicationservers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<App Server> folders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce this is done, you perform these tasks:  * Repackage your client applications with the up-to-date libraries.\\\\\\\\n * Reapply product customizations to the up-to-date Java EE modules (EARs and WARs).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that all customizations you developed before the update, for example modifications of the descriptors, must be reapplied to the new, up-to-date EARs and WARs. It is a good idea to document and automate those customizations using scripts to make the process easier and error-proof.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, you must update the client applications and ODM modules on your server or servers with the same settings as you deployed previously. If you redeploy the application, follow again the documentation instructions to deploy all ODM modules to your servers [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.distrib.config/topics/odm_distrib_config.html].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKeep in mind that applying a modification or a fix pack does not require any data migration, so your projects and database remain the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATING RULE EXECUTION SERVER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdate the following applications in the application server:  *  jrules-res-xu-<server>.rar jrules-res-management-<server>.ear jrules-ssp-<server>.ear jrules-res-htds-<server>ear\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: Updating the eXecution Unit RAR file requires a restart of the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATE DECISION CENTER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdate the following application in your application server:\\\\\\\\n * jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATE THE EVENTS RUNTIME\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 1. Stop the event runtime application, wberuntimeear.\\\\\\\\n 2. Uninstall the following applications, if they exist:  * wbefileconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbehttpconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbejdbcconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbejmsconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbesoapconnector\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 3. Update the application wberuntimeear.\\\\\\\\n 4. Start the application wberuntimeear.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\\\\\\\\n * Again, in addition to applying the latest modification or fix pack, consider migrating to the latest version or release (V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from recently added features and improvements. See our technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725] for more information.\\\\\\\\n * For JRules 7.1, you can refer to the JRules 7.1 list of fix packs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019787] and also Upgrading JRules to the latest V7.1 fix pack [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21474292] to learn how to apply the fix packs. But note that JRules 7.1 reaches end of support in September 2015 (see the IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] page). To ensure continued product support, plan an upgrade to the latest product version before that date.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Fix pack release notification for ODM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593 ]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Maintenance Platform Independent 7.1, 7.0\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.389,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"30083db3\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"30083db3-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/30083db3.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"service release; modpack; mod pack; upgrade; refresh; refresh pack DOWNLOADABLE\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"service release; modpack; mod pack; upgrade; refresh; refresh pack DOWNLOADABLE FILES\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nABSTRACT\\\\\\\\n IBM Packaging Utility 1.8 has been made generally available and contains any fixes for client-reported and internally found defects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTable of Contents Sections Description  * What\\'s new\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Change history section provides an overview on what is new in this release with a description of any new functions or enhancements when applicable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Impact assessment\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe How critical is this fix section provides information related to the impact of this release to allow you to assess how your environment may be affected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Prerequisites\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Prerequisites section provides important information to review prior to the installation of this release.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Download package\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Download package section provides the direct link to obtain the download package for installation in your environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Installation instructions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Installation instructions section provides the installation instructions necessary to apply this release into your environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Known problems\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Known side effects section contains a link to the known problems (open defects) identified at the time of this release.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupporting Documentation Document Description  * Detailed System Requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27036456]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClick to review the detailed system requirements information for a complete list of hardware requirements, supported operating systems, prerequisites and optional supported software, with component-level details and operating system restrictions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * IBM Knowledge Center [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSDV2W_1.8.0/com.ibm.cic.auth.ui.doc/helpindex_pu.html]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIBM Knowledge Center provides an entry point to product documentation.

Running the report in HTML displays the images.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCAUSE\\\\\\\\nIncomplete or missing Chain of Trust for SSL within the IBM Cognos Keystore\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\\\\\\\nThere are two options available:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 1. Place the images on the application tier in the Cognos installation directory in the same path they exist on the gateway server. This way the Application Tier can access the image on disk, removing the need to connect to HTTPS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Example: <cognos install>/webcontent/samples/images/pic.jpg\\\\\\\\n 2.\\\\\\\\n 3. Import the SSL certificate Chain of Trust on the Application Tier.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSteps to import the SSL Chain of Trust:\\\\\\\\n 1. Obtain the CA certificate and any Intermediate certificates which is in the chain of the trust that has signed the Web site certificate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 2. Import the certificate(s) in the IBM Cognos CA keystore by typing the following command (from a command window in the <install dir>/bin directory) where ca.cer is the name of the certificate file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * ThirdPartyCertificateTool.bat -T -i -r ca.cer -k ../configuration/signkeypair/jCAKeystore -p <keystore_password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe default password for the KeyStore is NoPassWordSet. For example:\\\\\\\\n * ThirdPartyCertificateTool.bat -T -i -r ca.cer -k ../configuration/signkeypair/jCAKeystore -p NoPassWordSet\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: Ensure that the correct gateway URL with \\\\\\\\\\\\\"https\\\\\\\\\\\\\" at the beginning has been saved in Cognos Configuration for all dispatchers.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8939,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"650b66a9\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"650b66a9-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/650b66a9.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"SUBSCRIBE TO THIS APAR\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"SUBSCRIBE TO THIS APAR\\\\\\\\nBy subscribing, you receive periodic emails alerting you to the status of the APAR, along with a link to the fix after it becomes available.

Instead, it is a subscription plan which allows users to download/run the very latest version of Office. In other words, customers who own Office 365 licenses will probably be upgrading their Excel versions (over time) as new MS Excel versions are released.\\\\\\\\n=> This makes it impossible to give a simple \\'yes/no\\' answer to the question to whether Cognos Analysis for Microsoft Excel or Planning Analytics for Microsoft Excel supports MS Office 365.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft Office 365 is supported so long as all of the following are true:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * The version of Office installed (for example Office 2016) as part of Office 365, is supported by that version of Cognos Analysis for Microsoft Excel or Planning Analytics for Microsoft Excel. For example:  * Cognos Analysis for Microsoft Excel 10.2.2 FP6 is the first release in that line that supports Excel 2016. All earlier versions of CAFE 10.2.2 (FP5 and earlier) support a maximum of Office 2013.\\\\\\\\n    * Planning Analytics for Microsoft Excel has supported Excel 2016 since its release.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Using desktop-installed (downloaded) Office 365 (not the cloud version of Office 365), which has been installed via the traditional installation method or if you have installed via click to run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n========================================\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Office 365 is not supported when running directly in the Cloud (instead of running on the desktop/laptop directly).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n========================================\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ1 - What are the different methods to install Microsoft Office 365?\\\\\\\\nMicrosoft Office 365 can be installed in two different ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(1) Traditional method\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * This is sometimes called the \\'MSI\\' or \\'Windows Installer\\' method\\\\\\\\n * It is also sometimes known as the \\'Volume License\\' method\\\\\\\\n * The application is installed (and runs) natively/directly on the users client device\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(2) Click-to-run  * The user \\\\\\\\\\\\\"streams\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the portion of Office that they need (downloading extra portions as and when they need it). The software is running in an isolated \\'Sandbox\\' environment (\\'virtual bubble\\') on the computer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ2 - What is \\'Click to Run\\' ?\\\\\\\\nClick-to-Run is a streaming and virtualization technology that is designed to significantly reduce the time that is required to download and use Office client products. Streaming allows users to begin to use a Click-to-Run product before the complete product is downloaded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClick-to-Run for Office 365 products are based on core virtualization and streaming Microsoft Application Virtualization ( App-V) technologies. Click-to-Run resources run in an isolated virtual environment on the local operating system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ3 - How can I check if my installation is \\'traditional\\' or \\'click to run\\'?\\\\\\\\n * Method #1 (recommended)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Launch Excel (or Outlook or Word).\\\\\\\\n2. Click \\\\\\\\\\\\\"File - Account\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (or Office Account).\\\\\\\\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22015168&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22015168&aid=1]\\\\\\\\n- If you see an \\\\\\\\\\\\\" Update Options\\\\\\\\\\\\\" item, you have a Click-to-Run installation\\\\\\\\n- If you don\\'t see the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Update Options\\\\\\\\\\\\\" item, you have an MSI-based install.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Method #2 (alternative)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee where EXCEL.EXE is installed/run from:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(1) Traditional (MSI):\\\\\\\\nBy default, EXCEL.EXE is located in the following locations:  * Office 2013 (32-bit): C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Office15\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n * Office 2016 (32-bit): C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Microsoft Office\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\root\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Office16\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(2) Click to Run:\\\\\\\\nBy default, EXCEL.EXE is located in the following locations:  * Office 2013 (32-bit): C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Microsoft Office 15\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ClientX64\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Root\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Office15\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n * Office 2016 (32-bit): C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Microsoft Office 16\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ClientX64\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Root\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Office16\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQ4 - What should I do if I have already installed MS Office 365 as \\'click to run\\', and it is unsupported in my version of Cognos Analysis for Microsoft Excel or Planning Analytics for Microsoft Excel ?\\\\\\\\nEither:\\\\\\\\n(a) Remove the Click-To-Run installed Office.

Prior to use of IM, the fixpacks for IHS (V7 and V6.x) did not include files expected to be customized such as default static content files like index.html and other HTML, GIF, and ICO files installed by IHS to its <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs directory. More importantly the admin.passwd file (that holds the user/passsword for the IHS Admin Service) is usually configured right after install when using the Plugin Configration Tool (PCT).\\n    14→\\n    15→Prior to use of IM you could not install directly to a fixpack level. You had to install the base GA code (i.e. 7.0.0.0 or 6.1.0.0) and then use the Update Installer to apply fixpacks. IM supports installation directly to a fixpack level therefore all install files included with the base GA code 8.0.0.0 are applied with the fixpack. Any files that should not be overwritten must be listed in a exception list (of non-serviceable files) that the IM installer can reference. This list of non-serviceable files was ommitted or incomplete for IHS V8.0.0.0 and 8.5.0.0 so the install of the first fixpack (regardless of fixpack level) may overwrite files such as admin.passwd and index.html.\\n    16→\\n    17→There are two APAR related to the same event:\\n    18→.\\n    19→PM71612: ADDITIONAL NON-SERVICEABLE FILES ADDED FOR IBM HTTP SERVER.\\n    20→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM71612 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM71612]\\n    21→.\\n    22→PM63634: IHS CONFIG ADMIN.PASSWD FILE WAS RESET AFTER INSTALLING\\n    23→FIXPACK 3 ON WAS 8.0.0.2 or 7.0.0.25 on Windows.\\n    24→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM63634 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM63634]\\n    25→\\n    26→.\\n    27→The technote about PM63634: IHS CONFIG ADMIN.PASSWD FILE WAS RESET advises a resolution in reseting the admin.passwd file:\\n    28→\\n    29→Installation of IBM HTTP Server 7.0.0.25, 8.0.0.1, 8.0.0.2, 8.0.0.3 will overlay admin.passwd:\\n    30→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593118 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593118]\\n    31→\\n    32→The main impact is that the IHS admin.passwd file gets overwritten which means the IHS Admin User/PW must be reset with the htpasswd utility in the IHS bin directory. Some customers customize the IHS splash page (index.html) or other default pages provided by IHS install so apply of first fixpack can overwrite these files and the customer\\'s customization.\\n    33→\\n    34→The list of these non-serviceable files where included in 8.0.0.5 and 8.5.0.1 per the APAR links above so once that fixpack level is applied then any future fixpacks will not overwrite these files. There is no way to avoid the event if GA 8.0.0.0/8.5.0.0 IHS is installed first. The first fixpack applied (of any fixpack) could replace the files.\\n    35→\\n    36→This Technote defines three recommendations to avoid the problem.\\n    37→\\n    38→SYMPTOM\\n    39→- The admin.passwd is a zero byte file after apply of fixpack\\n    40→\\n    41→ - Any content installed under <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs by IHS install (default static content files) that have been customized are replaced by their default originals after apply of fixpack\\n    42→\\n    43→CAUSE\\n    44→Files not marked as non-serviceable files for IM install of fixpacks for IHS per APAR PM71612\\n    45→\\n    46→ENVIRONMENT\\n    47→WebSphere environments that use IHS v8.x to run the WSAS plugin for Webservers to act as proxy front to WSAS appservers.\\n    48→\\n    49→RESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\n    50→Support suggests one of three recommendations to avoid the problem:\\n    51→\\n    52→1. Use IM to install IHS at fixpack 8.0.0.5/8.5.0.1 or higher bypassing the install of 8.0.0.0/8.5.0.0\\n    53→\\n    54→2. Do not use PCT, configure IHS Admin or use htpasswd (or other customization/config) until after fixpack has been applied.\\n    55→\\n    56→3. If you have already installed 8.0.0.0 or 8.5.0.0 then before you apply your first IHS fixpack backup these files:\\n    57→\\n    58→- admin.passwd\\n    59→\\n    60→- all content under <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs\\n    61→\\n    62→\\n    63→\\n    64→PRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\\n    65→ IHS\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

7, TEP client (Java WebStart method) no longer starts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSYMPTOM\\\\\\\\nThe execution fails with the following errors :\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ncom.sun.deploy.net.FailedDownloadException: Unable to load resource:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n http://host.xxx.dev.yyy:15200/commons-discovery-0.2.jar.jnlp\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nat com.sun.deploy.net.DownloadEngine.actionDownload(Unknown Source)\\\\\\\\nat

Source)\\\\\\\\nat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connectToAddress(Unknown Source)\\\\\\\\nat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connect(Unknown Source)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCAUSE\\\\\\\\nPossible explanations for this failure are :\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1) IHS not running on TEPS system\\\\\\\\n2) Firewall preventing communication with port 15200\\\\\\\\n3) Corrupted or invalid local files on workstation machine where TEP client is launched\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNothing explicitly related with Windows 7, unless specific firewall rules have been applied with the new\\\\\\\\noperating system\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\\\\\\\n1) Check if port 15200 is in LISTENING on the TEPS server.If not, likely the IHS is not running and you need to investigate about failures on TEPS side, considering that IHS should be started and stopped automatically with TEPS service.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2) If port 15200 is available and in LISTENING on TEPS, verify if any firewall (locally to the workstation that is trying to launch TEP or the network boundary firewall) is preventing communication with that specific port. You may need to change firewall rules to allow access on port 15200.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the first two options are fine, communication works normally so it is possible that the problem is with the application or JNLP file locally stored on the Windows workstation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3) On the workstation where TEP client runs, from Windows Control Panel, open the Java Control Panel and clear the Java cache.Then download TEP application again using the following URL from a web browser:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n http://TEPS_host_name:1920///cnp/kdh/lib/tep.jnlp\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this way you will get rid of any inconsistency of the TEP client application previously downloaded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\\\\\\\\n IBM Tivoli Monitoring V6.2.3 Tivoli Enterprise Portal Client\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.4206,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"63364282\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"63364282-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/63364282.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"SUBSCRIBE\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"SUBSCRIBE\\\\\\\\nYou can track all active APARs for this component.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR STATUS\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nERROR DESCRIPTION\\\\\\\\n *  Environment:\\\\\\\\n   Occurs only when using the browser  to access TEPS.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Problem Description:\\\\\\\\n     Each time you logon to TEPS jar file is downloaded though you\\\\\\\\n   have\\\\\\\\n     caching enabled.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   This is not an issue with 6.2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLOCAL FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\\\\\\\\n *  An additional 6m of byte code was being dowmloaded to the tep\\\\\\\\n   client even though all of the necessary jar files were already\\\\\\\\n   in the local java plugin cache.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\\\\\\\\n *  The fix for this APAR is included in the following maintenance\\\\\\\\n   vehicle:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n      | interim fix | 6.1.0.7-TIV-ITM-IF0001\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Note: Search the IBM technical support web site for maintenance\\\\\\\\n   package availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTEMPORARY FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCOMMENTS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * APAR NUMBER\\\\\\\\n   IZ17689\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   TEP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   5724C04EP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED RELEASE\\\\\\\\n   610\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * STATUS\\\\\\\\n   CLOSED PER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * PE\\\\\\\\n   NoPE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * HIPER\\\\\\\\n   NoHIPER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\\\\\\\\n   NoSpecatt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SUBMITTED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2008-03-13\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2008-06-27\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2008-06-27\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFIX INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   TEP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   5724C04EP\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\\\\\\\\n * R610 PSY\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.2065,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c4705b38\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c4705b38-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/c4705b38.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Java Security U51 DOWNLOADABLE FILES\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Java Security U51 DOWNLOADABLE FILES\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nABSTRACT\\\\\\\\n 4.2.0-TIV-KIP-FP0009 This is a cumulative fix pack for Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for IMS on z/OS V420\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\\\\\\\\nTivoli OMEGAMON XE for IMS on z/OS V420 fix pack 9 consists of the following files:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFix pack file name Description 4.2.0-TIV-KIP-FP0009.README Contains the README for Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for IMS on z/OS V420 Fixpack 9. 4.2.0-TIV-KIP-FP0009.tar.gz Contains the Fix Pack 9 updates to Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for IMS on z/OS V420 application support for TEMS, TEPS, or TEP deployed on the AIX, Linux, HP-UX, and Solaris platforms. 4.2.0-TIV-KIP-FP0009.zip Contains the Fix Pack 9 updates to Tivoli OMEGAMON XE for IMS on z/OS V420 application support for TEMS, TEPS, or TEP deployed on Windows platforms.

For maintenance purposes it may be necessary to install fix packs and/or interim fixes for eWAS and IHS.\\\\\\\\nYou can use this procedure to install fix packs and interim fixes for a given eWAS and IHS version, but not to upgrade to a new eWAS or IHS version. For example, you can use it to install eWAS 7.0.0.43 on top of eWAS 7.0.0.29, but you cannot use it to install eWAS version 8.0 on top of eWAS version 7.0.\\\\\\\\nThe following table shows the different levels of eWAS and IHS that are provided by 6.2.3:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nITM version eWAS version IHS version 6.23.05.00 7.0.0.29 7.0.0.00 6.23.03.00 - 6.23.04.00 7.0.0.25 7.0.0.00 6.23.01.00 - 6.23.02.00 7.0.0.19 7.0.0.00 6.23.00.00 7.0.0.15 7.0.0.00\\\\\\\\nThis technote applies specifically to eWAS, not the full version of WebSphere. Further, this technote applies only to V6.2.3 of ITM.\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nFollow these steps to install a new eWAS fix pack into your ITM environment:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 1. Back up your ITM environment.\\\\\\\\nBack up your ITM environment using your local procedures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 2. Download the maintenance installation scripts.\\\\\\\\nDownload the appropriate eWAS/IHS maintenance installation script to the system where your TEPS resides.\\\\\\\\nUnix/Linux: Download ewasihsv7update.sh attached below. Ensure that the script has execute permission after it has been downloaded.\\\\\\\\nls -l ./ewasihsv7update.sh\\\\\\\\nchmod a+rx ./ewasihsv7update.sh\\\\\\\\nWindows: Download ewasihsv7update.cmd attached below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 3. Generate the list of files that need to be downloaded.\\\\\\\\nRun ewasihsv7update.sh or ewasihsv7update.cmd to generate the list of files that need to be downloaded and to create the temporary directory to hold them.\\\\\\\\nWhen the prompt beginning with \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Have all required files been downloaded to\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is displayed,\\\\\\\\nrespond with n to exit the script so that you can download the required files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe usage information for the command follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Unix:\\\\\\\\n   ewasihsv7update.sh [-h candle_directory] [-w working_directory] [-u updateinstaller directory]\\\\\\\\n   -h Fully qualified path of the ITM installation directory.\\\\\\\\n   -w Fully qualified path of the temporary working directory for file downloads.\\\\\\\\n   -u Fully qualified path of the UpdateInstaller installation directory.\\\\\\\\n   If ewasihsv7update.sh was downloaded to CANDLEHOME/bin/, then the -h option is not needed.\\\\\\\\n   The working directory default value is: /tmp/ewasihsv7. You can specify a different location using the -w option.\\\\\\\\n   The -u option should only be used when installation of the UpdateInstaller to the documented default directory is not permitted.  *  AIX Default Location:\\\\\\\\n      /usr/IBM/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller Linux Default Location:\\\\\\\\n      /opt/IBM/WebSphere/UpdateInstaller\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Windows:\\\\\\\\n   ewasihsv7update.cmd [-h candle_directory] [-w working_directory] [-u updateinstaller directory]\\\\\\\\n   -h Fully qualified path of the ITM installation directory.\\\\\\\\n   -w Fully qualified path of the temporary working directory for file downloads.\\\\\\\\n   -u Fully qualified path of the UpdateInstaller installation directory.\\\\\\\\n   The ITM installation directory default value is the %CANDLE_HOME% value retrieved from the shell environment. Normally the -h option is not needed.\\\\\\\\n   The working directory default value is: %TEMP%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ewasihsv7. You can specify a different location using the -w option.\\\\\\\\n   The -u option should only be used when installation of the UpdateInstaller to the documented default directory is not permitted.  * Windows Default Location:\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\IBM\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\WebSphere\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\UpdateInstaller\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 4: Download the files listed in the output from step 3 between the two delimiter lines starting with:\\\\\\\\n<><><><><><><><><><>\\\\\\\\nThere are a number of ways to download the files:  1. If a browser is available on the TEPS system:  * For each file listed between the two delimiter lines in the output from step 3;  * Copy and paste the full line, one at a time, into the browser address bar and then hit enter.\\\\\\\\n        * Save the file to the working directory displayed after the second delimiter line in the output from step 3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 2. If the wget utility is available, in a command prompt on the TEPS system:  * Change directory to the working directory displayed after the second delimiter line in the output from step 3.\\\\\\\\n     * For each file listed between the two delimiter lines in the output from step 3;  * Enter the wget command followed by the copy and paste of the full line, and then hit enter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 3. If the ftp utility is available, in a command prompt on the TEPS system:  * Change directory to the working directory displayed after the second delimiter line in the output from step 3.\\\\\\\\n     * Run the ftp command and connect to public.dhe.ibm.com as anonymous.\\\\\\\\n     * For each file listed between the two delimiter lines in the output from step 3;  * Change the remote directory to parent directory of the file (starting with /software/websphere/appserv/support)\\\\\\\\n        * Get the file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 4. Use any other method available to you to download the files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 5. Install the UpdateInstaller and eWAS and IHS maintenance\\\\\\\\nRun ewasihsv7update.sh or ewasihsv7update.cmd again\\\\\\\\nWhen the prompt starting with \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Have all required files been downloaded to\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is displayed,\\\\\\\\nrespond with y to allow the script to continue and perform the UpdateInstaller and maintenance installation actions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 6.

Alternatively, change the group of the Data Collector installation tree (DC_home) to this group, for example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nchgrp -R sapsys /opt/IBM/itcam/J2EE/DC\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor all files and directories in the tree, the group must have at least the same permissions as the owner. To achieve this in the simplest way, grant the group read, write, and execute permissions for all files in the tree, for example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nchown -R g+rwx /opt/IBM/itcam/J2EE/DC\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso, make sure that the group has read and write permissions for the Tivoli logging directory (by default, /var/ibm/tivoli/common),\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo configure each SAP NetWeaver instance that you need to monitor, run the Data Collector configuration tool using the admin user for the instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Systems and Asset Management Tivoli Composite Application Manager for J2EE ITCAM J2EE NETWEAVER Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Linux 6.1\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.0455,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"92f09282\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"92f09282-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/92f09282.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"CAMADALL Tomcat Apache download install start up monitor tema TECHNOTE (FAQ)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"CAMADALL Tomcat Apache download install start up monitor tema TECHNOTE (FAQ)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTHIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):\\\\\\\\n US English\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nQUESTION\\\\\\\\n Downloading and installing the Tomcat Apache server in preparation for ITCAM monitoring.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nSo you want to download, install and monitor the Apache Tomcat server on your Windows system but don\\'t quite know where to start?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWell, start here...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA.

However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\\n    46→\\n    47→When using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server\\'s allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\\n    48→\\n    49→For DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059.\\n    50→\\n    51→Cases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.\\n    52→\\n    53→Note: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] (\"Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread\") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server.

The properties in this sample are only examples, the settings in this file are dependent on the specific LDAP setup in your environment.\\n    26→\\n    27→1) Contact LDAP administrator to determine LDAP Server settings for APMUI users. Validate what filters must be used, as well as values for the bindDN and bindPassword etc, based on how the LDAP Directory Information Tree (DIT) is configured.\\n    28→\\n    29→The meaning of various properties in the ldapRegistry.xml are as follows:\\n    30→\\n    31→baseDN: specifies the starting point in the LDAP (DIT) for all LDAP searches\\n    32→bindDN: specifies the distinguished name for the application server to use when it attempts to bind to the LDAP server\\n    33→bindPwd: specifies the password for the application server to user when binding to LDAP\\n    34→\\n    35→The filters:\\n    36→\\n    37→userFilter: defines the filter is used to search LDAP for users\\n    38→groupFilter: defines the filter used to search LDAP for groups\\n    39→userIdMap: specifies the LDAP filter that maps the short name of a user to an LDAP entry\\n    40→groupIdMap: specifies the LDAP filter that maps the short name of a group to an LDAP entry\\n    41→groupMemberIdMap: specifies the LDAP filter that identifies user-to-group relationships. It specifies which property of an objectclass stores the list of members belonging to the group represented by the objectclass.\\n    42→\\n    43→The filters do not need to be specified. If they are not specified they contain default values depending on the LDAP server type (IBM Directory Server, Microsoft Active Directory etc). So these are always required, but if the default values match with the LDAP tree\\'s configuration, then they do no need to be explicitly specified in the server.xml file.\\n    44→\\n    45→For Active Directory, if no filters are specified, the default values for the filters are as follows:\\n    46→\\n    47→// Active Directory LDAP\\n    48→\\n    49→filters.put(LdapConfig.USER_FILTER, \"(&(sAMAccountName=%v)(objectcategory=user))\");\\n    50→filters.put(LdapConfig.GROUP_FILTER, \"(&(cn=%v)(objectcategory=group))\");\\n    51→filters.put(LdapConfig.USER_ID_MAP, \"user:sAMAccountName\");\\n    52→filters.put(LdapConfig.GROUP_ID_MAP, \"*:cn\");\\n    53→filters.put(LdapConfig.GROUP_MEMBER_ID_MAP, \"memberof:member\");\\n    54→\\n    55→Again, these should match with how the LDAP server is actually set up in terms of objectclasses, and attributes on the LDAP entries.

The documentation explains:\n\n> \"WebSphere Application Server cannot always detect port conflicts when multiple installations are present on multiple hosts. To set port numbers in this situation so that you avoid port conflicts, adjust the starting port numbers of each installation to be in a different range from the other installations.\"\n\n## Solution\n\nWhen creating profiles with different versions on the same server, you need to explicitly set the starting port to ensure the new version uses your intended port range:\n\n**Use the `-startingPort` option when creating the profile:**\n\n```\nbin/manageprofiles.sh -create -profileName <ProfileName> \n  -profilePath <path> \n  -templatePath <template> \n  -startingPort 7000\n```\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/198a9314.md > lines 201-205]\n\nThis ensures that v9.0 will use ports starting from 7000 (within your 7000-8000 range) instead of trying to use the default port 6,002.\n\n**Note:** The documentation also mentions that \"Node agents do not inherit the starting port number from the deployment manager. If needed, manually change the port number settings.\"\n\n⚠️ The documents found are about WebSphere Application Server, not specifically WTX Launcher. However, the port configuration principles should apply similarly.

both\n3. **Flexibility**: While the bundled approach is the default, separate Java SDK fixpacks are still available if you need to upgrade just the SDK\n\n**For earlier versions (V7.0 and below):**\n-

Server?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCAUSE\\\\\\\\nUpdating to the latest compatible Java SDK could help you resolve problems more quickly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nThe IBM WebSphere Application Server Java SDK can be upgraded to the latest service release for the same Java SDK version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nList of WebSphere Application Server fix packs and the corresponding Java SDK versions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg27005002]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPolicy Summary by WebSphere Application Server release:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWebSphere Application Server V8.0, V8.5, V8.5.5\\\\\\\\nStarting with V8.0 and applicable to all subsequent releases and fixpacks, there is one install package that contains updates for both WebSphere Application Server and Java SDK. Applying fixpacks of WebSphere Application Server also upgrades the SDK that is packaged and bundled within the fixpack. Additionally, separate Java SDK fixpacks are also available that contain just the SDK updates which can be applied to upgrade the SDK.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWebSphere Application Server V7.0\\\\\\\\nAny V7.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.6.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWebSphere Application Server V6.1\\\\\\\\nAny V6.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.5.0 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWebSphere Application Server V6.0\\\\\\\\nAny V6.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWebSphere Application Server V5.1\\\\\\\\nAny V5.1 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.4.1 and any V5.1.1 can be upgraded to the latest Java SDK 1.4.2 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWebSphere Application Server V5.0\\\\\\\\nAny V5.0 fix pack can upgrade to the latest Java SDK 1.3.1 service release packaged for WebSphere Application Server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDetails of Java SDK Upgrade Policy\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWebSphere Application Server leverages the Java SDK as a base component. This results in unique support issues, including:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Matching Java SDK service releases to Application Server releases and fix packs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Delivering updates and fixes associated with the Java SDK on any given Application Server release.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn an effort to resolve customer Java SDK situations as quickly as possible, WebSphere Application Server Support has done a quickest-path-to-resolution analysis, determining the most direct way to collect problem information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn some cases, problem resolution might include finding shortcuts to resolve symptoms. One shortcut is an immediate upgrade to a newer compatible Java SDK service release, before gathering detailed problem determination data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are multiple advantages to performing an immediate Java SDK upgrade as a quicker path to resolution over a full Problem Determination (PD) process:\\\\\\\\n 1. There is a continuous stream of fixes going into the Java SDK. Many problems encountered by customers are resolved by these fixes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 2. When a new problem is encountered, applying the latest Java SDK is a quick way to determine if related fixes change the symptoms or correct the problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 3. Many documented Java SDK fixes have common symptoms. Frequently, limited PD data does not isolate the problem to a single root cause.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese factors highlight the advantage of applying a newer Java SDK before working through a full PD cycle.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJava SDK and WebSphere Application Server software are updated frequently. To avoid compatibility issues for customers, WebSphere Application Server Support maintains this Java SDK Upgrade Policy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWebSphere Application Server Support details:\\\\\\\\nhttp://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html [http://www.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/support.html]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdentifying compatibility limitations between WebSphere Application Server releases and Java SDK service releases that have not been tested together reduces risk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImportant: Using a Java SDK not specifically packaged with WebSphere Application Server and supplied by IBM, or in violation of the Java SDK Upgrade Policy, is not supported by IBM WebSphere Application Server Support for Java SDK problems.

A table containing the panel of experts is also included.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo play or download the audio of this Ask the Experts session, see the Audio Section of this document (audio not available until after the webcast).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the Related Information Section of this document for a list of documents referenced during the presentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAsk the Experts session\\\\\\\\n12 December 2013 - 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. EST\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTime Questions asked 00:00 General introduction 02:40 Technical introduction 03:38 How can I use command line options to find what is installed and what offerings are available in the repository? 06:05 What option can I use to uninstall ifix and fixpack? 07:43 IMShared directory is using a lot of space, is there an option to delete files from this directory? 11:27 Is it possible to change AppData agent directory from default after WebSphere Application Server and other offerings are installed? 15:24 What options do I have to install Liberty 8.5.5? 17:00 Open lines for live question and answer period 17:03 On a non-administrator install, does it have to be the user_home? Can it be directed to a shared (NFS) space? 17:40 What is the difference between WAS installation through IM and Silent mode installation? 19:21 How to import license from RAD 7.0 to 8.5.5 (trial version)? 19:51 Can you please give an overview of using IM to install ifix? 20:38 I have WAS ND 8.5.5 32-bit installed on a 32-bit linux server, and I have a new linux 64bit server that we want only the 64bit 8.5.5 WAS, and use the DMGR on the 32-bit server, how do we do this? 22:14 Why is IBM only providing Installation of WebSphere Application Server through Installation Mananger? 23:01 When we go for Ifix and when we go for fixpack, what is basic difference between those? 23:50 Can you pleasee give information about what is the use of Liberty profile and its advantages? 24:57 What do you recommend if there is a need to duplicate the WebSphere environment? 26:54 What are the basic pre-req checks for installation of Installation Manager? 28:19 Do you have a link for how to federate the 64-bit WAS ND APPSERVER to 32-bit DMGR, instructions/step (jython scripting) so it can be automated? 29:20 With WebSphere products changing the method of installation, is there a white paper, or recommended practices, for setting up a central repository? 30:33 Is there any way make a WAS back-up through Installation Manager? 30:52 Do we have to uninstall previous ifix before installing latest fix pack? 32:09 We are planning to migrate from WAS 6.1 to WAS8.5.5, can I install 8.5.5 on top of the existing 6.1 profile? Or does it have to be a fresh installation? 33:10 I have an NFS share on 3 servers and IIM is installed there. Can I utilize IIM to install/uninstall with 2 different users without any issues on all 3 servers? 34:44 Is there a document for migrating WebSphere 7 to WAS 8.7 entire cell, say node-by-node? 35:11 What provisions does WebSphere Application Server provide to prevent denial of service attacks? 35:40 If we have 32-bit 8.5.5 DMGR and 1 APPSRVR 32-bit 8.5.5 and a 2nd APPSRVR 64-bit 8.5.5, does the DMGR have to be updated first or can we update the APPServers first? That is, does the order matter for fixes? 36:58 Is it a good idea to create any dependency on the dmgr for runtime? For example, Adobe Life Cycle installed on top of WAS uses some cache mechanism called gds, gemfire, etc. 37:42 I noticed on IM with 8.5 that when you choose to install the updates, it always goes through your IBM PA account to get the updates and the latest. But with Maximo application for instance, you only want to go to 8.5.0.1 for instance, so the only way I found is run the update pointing to the repository for fix 1, and choose update and keep clicking cancel to look online to continue and install the fix 1. Is this the only way to install a fix on V8 or V8.5? 39:40 When migrating WAS from 6.1 to 8.5, do you guys recommend using the migration tool or create configurations using scripts? 40:44 To upgrade websphere from 6.1 to 8.5, What path do you suggest: fresh install or migration proces?. If you suggest migration process where can I get the documentation? 42:34 To get to WAS 8.0 from WAS 8.1, is this a migration process only? 42:57 What is the latest fix pack available on top of 8.5.5.0 base (and location to down load from Passport Advantage)? 43:37 Is there a fixed release scheduled for FixPacks? I hear that it\\'s every 3 months or so. 44:24 If I have 1000 servers to apply FP, whats the recommended method to apply fixes to large number of servers in minimum time; any tools available? 47:01 I have IIM, WASND, WAS installed and configured per application\\'s requirement. Now, I want to install another instance of WAS. Does IIM have an option to take the existing WAS as a template so that I can get the configuration also? 47:49 We are planning to upgrade from 6.1 to 8.5.5.0. What\\'s the stable version (already being used by companies)? 48:45 Closing remarks 50:05 End of Call\\\\\\\\nPanel of Experts: Jeanette Daly WebSphere Application Server L2 Support Mike Hill WebSphere Application Server L2 Support Vishavpal Shergill WebSphere Application Server L2 Support Vikram Thommandru WebSphere Application Server L2 Support\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPRESENTATION\\\\\\\\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-12122013-AskTheExperts-WebSphere_Application_Server_installation_update_uninstall.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27040108&aid=2]WSTE-12122013-AskTheExperts-WebSphere_Application_Server_installation_update_uninstall.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27040108&aid=1]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGet Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAUDIO\\\\\\\\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this conference call, click on Download Audio [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/December-12-2013-Daly-Hill-Shergill-Thommandru.mp3](audio in MP3 format).

See the V.R.M.F Maintenance Stream Delivery Vehicle terminology explanation [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656] for more details.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModification and fix pack numbers are the third and fourth digits in the IBM product version number, for example: 8.5.M.F.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModification and fix packs include only bug fixes, so they do not affect the product functionality or your data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the following technotes to find out which update your installation need:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Finding the version of ODM product and fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21627850] to determine the exact product versions that are installed on your machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Find the version of ODM components [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21400738] to determine the exact module or library versions that are deployed on your servers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] to learn about the latest modification or fix pack that is available for your product version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * IBM Operational Decision Manager detailed system requirements [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27023067] to verify that your configuration is supported with your current product version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] to verify that your current version does not reach end of support in the near future.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReferring to the last two documents above, you may find out that you need to migrate to the latest product version to ensure continued support of your applications. In that case, refer to technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat being said, make sure to consider migrating to the latest version or release ( V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from the latest added features and improvements.\\\\\\\\nANSWER\\\\\\\\nAs with any software product, even if you do not have any issues with running your current configuration, you should apply the latest modification or fix pack to take advantage of these benefits:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * Anticipate and avoid the risk of encountering defects already fixed.\\\\\\\\n * Apply the latest product improvements that are available (performance, for example).\\\\\\\\n * Maintain a serviceable system and be able to install an interim fix when required.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWHEN TO UPDATE\\\\\\\\nThe latest modification or fix pack should be installed as soon as it is available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can subscribe to the IBM Support My Notifications [https://www.ibm.com/support/mynotifications] to be notified of any fix pack releases, and you can also bookmark the Operational Decision Manager Download document [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24031636] page, which lists the latest modifications or fix packs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the technote Fix pack release notification for Operational Decision Manager [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593] to find out when a modification or fix pack will be available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBEFORE UPDATING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe databases used in the sample server are deleted and recreated during the update. If you are using those databases and want to save the existing content, perform the following steps before updating:\\\\\\\\n *  Stop the sample server. In the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby, create an archive file containing the resdb and rtsdb folders. Save the archive file, such as zip file, in the data folder. After installation, unzip the archive file in the folder <ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby to restore your databases before restarting the sample server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA new profile is also created for the sample server, at the first server start following the installation of a modification or fix pack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to continue using the same ports, you must delete the existing profile prior. In the <ODM_HOME>/shared/bin folder, from the command line, run the command ../tools/ant/bin/ant forcedestroyprofile.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: The sample server is not designed to be used in a production system. For a production system, you must create a dedicated profile and database that you update using the following steps.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach modification or fix pack page provides instructions on how to download and run the installer, in addition to providing a list of corrections that are included in the update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fix pack installation updates the following files and folders:  * JAR libraries in the installation directories, including <ODMInstallDir>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<Module>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lib.\\\\\\\\n * EAR and WAR applications in the <ODMInstallDir>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<Module>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\applicationservers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<App Server> folders.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce this is done, you perform these tasks:  * Repackage your client applications with the up-to-date libraries.\\\\\\\\n * Reapply product customizations to the up-to-date Java EE modules (EARs and WARs).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that all customizations you developed before the update, for example modifications of the descriptors, must be reapplied to the new, up-to-date EARs and WARs. It is a good idea to document and automate those customizations using scripts to make the process easier and error-proof.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, you must update the client applications and ODM modules on your server or servers with the same settings as you deployed previously. If you redeploy the application, follow again the documentation instructions to deploy all ODM modules to your servers [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r5m1/topic/com.ibm.odm.distrib.config/topics/odm_distrib_config.html].\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKeep in mind that applying a modification or a fix pack does not require any data migration, so your projects and database remain the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATING RULE EXECUTION SERVER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdate the following applications in the application server:  *  jrules-res-xu-<server>.rar jrules-res-management-<server>.ear jrules-ssp-<server>.ear jrules-res-htds-<server>ear\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: Updating the eXecution Unit RAR file requires a restart of the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATE DECISION CENTER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdate the following application in your application server:\\\\\\\\n * jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUPDATE THE EVENTS RUNTIME\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 1. Stop the event runtime application, wberuntimeear.\\\\\\\\n 2. Uninstall the following applications, if they exist:  * wbefileconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbehttpconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbejdbcconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbejmsconnector\\\\\\\\n     * wbesoapconnector\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n 3. Update the application wberuntimeear.\\\\\\\\n 4. Start the application wberuntimeear.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure you do not change the class loading policies for applications and modules ( parent last for all ODM modules).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\\\\\\\\n * Again, in addition to applying the latest modification or fix pack, consider migrating to the latest version or release (V.R.M.F) of the product as soon as possible to benefit from recently added features and improvements. See our technote Migrating to the latest version of Operational Decision Management [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21589725] for more information.\\\\\\\\n * For JRules 7.1, you can refer to the JRules 7.1 list of fix packs [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27019787] and also Upgrading JRules to the latest V7.1 fix pack [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21474292] to learn how to apply the fix packs. But note that JRules 7.1 reaches end of support in September 2015 (see the IBM Support Lifecycle [http://www.ibm.com/software/websphere/support/lifecycle/] page). To ensure continued product support, plan an upgrade to the latest product version before that date.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Fix pack release notification for ODM [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21665593 ]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Maintenance Platform Independent 7.1, 7.0\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.4626,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"14ca129f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"14ca129f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/14ca129f.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"A FIX IS AVAILABLE\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A FIX IS AVAILABLE\\\\\\\\nWebSphere MQ V7.0 Fix Pack 7.0.1.12 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24037169]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE\\\\\\\\nYou can track all active APARs for this component.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR STATUS\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED AS PROGRAM ERROR.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nERROR DESCRIPTION\\\\\\\\n *  WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS V7.0.1.5 (or later): Failure\\\\\\\\n   Data Capture (FDC) files\\\\\\\\n   with Probe\\\\\\\\n   ID JO076001 and JO205001 are generated following a remote\\\\\\\\n   connection to a Queue Manager that has conversation sharing\\\\\\\\n   disabled:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   | Probe Id     :- JO076001\\\\\\\\n   | Component    :- RemoteFAP.MQOPEN(Hconn,MQOD,int,Phobj,Pi\\\\\\\\n   | Probe Type   :- INCORROUT\\\\\\\\n   | Comment1     :- MQOPEN reply expected\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   | Probe Id     :- JO205001\\\\\\\\n   | Component    :- RemoteConnection.removeHconn(RemoteTls,R\\\\\\\\n   | Probe Type   :- INCORROUT\\\\\\\\n   | Comment1     :- Hconn is not associated with this connection\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLOCAL FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\\\\\\\\n *  ****************************************************************\\\\\\\\n   USERS AFFECTED:\\\\\\\\n   This issue affects users of the WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.5 Classes\\\\\\\\n   for Java/JMS (or later) who have established a remote connection\\\\\\\\n   to a Queue Manager via a channel that has Conversation Sharing\\\\\\\\n   disabled (SHARECNV=0 or SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   This includes users of:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Classes for JMS\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 Resource Adapter.\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere Application Server V7.0 and V8.0 WebSphere MQ\\\\\\\\n   messaging provider.\\\\\\\\n   - The WebSphere Application Server V6.1 WebSphere MQ messaging\\\\\\\\n   provider who have configured the WebSphere variable\\\\\\\\n   MQ_INSTALL_ROOT to point to a WebSphere MQ V7.0.1 installation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Platforms affected:\\\\\\\\n   All Distributed (iSeries, all Unix and Windows)\\\\\\\\n   ****************************************************************\\\\\\\\n   PROBLEM SUMMARY:\\\\\\\\n   By default in the WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS,\\\\\\\\n   conversation\\\\\\\\n   sharing is enabled and set to 10 on the client side. The client\\\\\\\\n   only discovers that Conversation Sharing is disabled following\\\\\\\\n   negotiation with a Queue Manager on the completion of a\\\\\\\\n   connection over a Channel that has SHARECNV=0 or SHARECNV=1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   When a WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS application requests a\\\\\\\\n   remote connection to a Queue Manager the client first attempts\\\\\\\\n   to find an already established TCP/IP connection which can be\\\\\\\\n   shared. As part of this process the list of known TCP/IP\\\\\\\\n   connections are matched for their suitability, this list\\\\\\\\n   includes connections which are in the process of being\\\\\\\\n   established (MQCONN reply not received from the Queue Manager).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   When a WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS application requested a\\\\\\\\n   remote connection it was matched for sharing with a connection\\\\\\\\n   that was still in the process of being established. The\\\\\\\\n   WebSphere MQ Client waited for the connection to complete and\\\\\\\\n   due to a small timing window began incorrectly sharing the\\\\\\\\n   connection without confirming the connection\\'s suitability. If\\\\\\\\n   the connection\\'s suitability had been checked then the\\\\\\\\n   connection\\\\\\\\n   would have been marked unsuitable due to the Negotiated Channel\\\\\\\\n   specifying that Conversation Sharing was disabled (SHARECNV=0 or\\\\\\\\n   SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n   As the connection (which did not support conversation sharing)\\\\\\\\n   was now shared by two threads, packets destined for one thread\\\\\\\\n   were erroneously received by the other, this led to the client\\\\\\\\n   being in an inconsistent state and the two FDCs being generated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\\\\\\\\n *  The WebSphere MQ Classes for Java/JMS have been modified to\\\\\\\\n   correctly restrict conversation sharing when using a connection\\\\\\\\n   that does not support conversation sharing (SHARECNV=0 or\\\\\\\\n   SHARECNV=1).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n   The fix is targeted for delivery in the following PTFs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Version    Maintenance Level\\\\\\\\n   v7.0       7.0.1.12\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   The latest available maintenance can be obtained from\\\\\\\\n   \\'WebSphere MQ Recommended Fixes\\'\\\\\\\\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006037]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   If the maintenance level is not yet available information on\\\\\\\\n   its planned availability can be found in \\'WebSphere MQ\\\\\\\\n   Planned Maintenance Release Dates\\'\\\\\\\\n   http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309 [http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg27006309]\\\\\\\\n   ---------------------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTEMPORARY FIX\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCOMMENTS\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPAR INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * APAR NUMBER\\\\\\\\n   IV47785\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   WMQ HP V7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   5724H7222\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * REPORTED RELEASE\\\\\\\\n   701\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * STATUS\\\\\\\\n   CLOSED PER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * PE\\\\\\\\n   NoPE\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * HIPER\\\\\\\\n   NoHIPER\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SPECIAL ATTENTION\\\\\\\\n   NoSpecatt\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * SUBMITTED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2013-09-02\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * CLOSED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2013-09-26\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * LAST MODIFIED DATE\\\\\\\\n   2014-01-13\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * APAR IS SYSROUTED TO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFIX INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT NAME\\\\\\\\n   WMQ HP V7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * FIXED COMPONENT ID\\\\\\\\n   5724H7222\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAPPLICABLE COMPONENT LEVELS\\\\\\\\n * R701 PSY\\\\\\\\n   UP\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.9637,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"52fb8d3c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"52fb8d3c-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 0,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/ragbench-techqa/52fb8d3c.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"SCA; Feature Pack for SCA; SCA Feature Pack Fix Pack 1.0.1.19 DOWNLOADABLE FILES\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"SCA; Feature Pack for SCA; SCA Feature Pack Fix Pack 1.0.1.19 DOWNLOADABLE FILES\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nABSTRACT\\\\\\\\n IBM WebSphere Application Server V7 Feature Pack for Service Component Architecture (SCA) Fix Pack 19 for distributed platforms, also known as SCA Feature Pack Fix Pack 1.0.1.19\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\\\\\\\\nSCA Feature Pack Fix Pack 1.0.1.19 is now available for your download through FTP and DD links by going to the Download Package section of this document.

way. There are several options other than relative\\\\\\\\n   to due date, for example, you could define the timer boundary\\\\\\\\n   event relative to the start of the step or a custom date that is\\\\\\\\n   hardcoded or is from a process variable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM SUMMARY\\\\\\\\n *  If a user task runs in a loop, each task instance has its own\\\\\\\\n   due date. A timer boundary event on an activity is a timer for\\\\\\\\n   the overall activity, not a timer for each instance of the loop.\\\\\\\\n   There is only one timer and that one timer cannot be calculated\\\\\\\\n   relative to multiple different due dates of several task\\\\\\\\n   instances.

A timer boundary event on an activity is a timer for\\\\\\\\n   the overall activity, not a timer for each instance of the loop.\\\\\\\\n   There is only one timer and that one timer cannot be calculated\\\\\\\\n   relative to multiple different due dates of several task\\\\\\\\n   instances. It is, therefore, not possible to run a process in\\\\\\\\n   such a combination.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPROBLEM CONCLUSION\\\\\\\\n *  A fix will be included in IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12\\\\\\\\n   that shows a validation error for processes that contain such a\\\\\\\\n   non-executable definition. If a user still models and runs this\\\\\\\\n   task, an improved failure message is provided.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   To determine whether the IBM BPM V8.5.7 cumulative fix 2016.12\\\\\\\\n   is available and download it if it is, complete the following\\\\\\\\n   steps on Fix Central:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   1.

Here's what you need to know:\n\n## Additional Steps After Installing Fix Pack with Installation Manager\n\nYes, there are additional steps required after installing the fix pack with Installation Manager. The installation only updates the JAR libraries and application files, but you need to apply these updates to your running environment.\n\n### Key Steps for Decision Center:\n\n**1. Update the Decision Center Application**\n- Update `jrules-teamserver-<server>.ear` in your application server\n- Ensure class loading policies remain \"parent last\" for all ODM modules\n\n**2. Reapply Customizations**\n- Any customizations you made to descriptors or configurations must be reapplied to the updated EAR/WAR files\n- Document and automate these customizations using scripts to make the process easier\n\n**3. Redeploy if Necessary**\n- If you redeploy the application, follow the ODM distribution configuration documentation to deploy all modules to your servers\n\n### Before Updating (Important):\n\n**For Sample Server Users:**\n- Stop the sample server\n- Backup databases in `<ODM_HOME>/shared/data/derby` (resdb and rtsdb folders)\n- After installation, restore the backup before restarting\n\n**Note:** The fix pack installation updates files in:\n- `<ODMInstallDir>/<Module>/lib` (JAR libraries)\n- `<ODMInstallDir>/<Module>/applicationservers/<App Server>` (EAR/WAR applications)\n\n### General Principle:\nApplying a modification or fix pack does not require data migration - your projects and database remain the same. However, you must update the deployed applications on your servers with the updated files.\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/08ceb9a6.md > UPDATE DECISION CENTER]\n\n⚠️ The document provides general guidance for ODM fix pack application but does not include version-specific instructions for 8.8.1.3.

For example, DFHAP0001 An abend (code 0C4/AKEA) has occurred at offset X\\'FFFFFFFF\\' in module DFHAMP. The X\\'FFFFFFFF\\' indicates that CICS was unable establish the location of the program check. So, you would like to locate the PSW and registers in your CICS system dump.\\n    14→\\n    15→RESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\n    16→If you have a system dump from a CICS TS V4.2 or V5.1 region, see locating the PSW for a program check in a CICS TS V5.3, V5.2, V5.1 or V4.2 system dump [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610631].\\n    17→\\n    18→If you have a system dump from a CICS TS V3.2 or lower region, see locating the PSW for a program check in a CICS TS V3 system dump [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21176381].\\n    19→\\n    20→If you have a system dump that contains your CICS TS V4.1 address space, you can do the following to locate the PSW and the registers for the program check:\\n    21→\\n    22→ 1.  Enter option 0 from the IPCS primary option menu to display the IPCS default values panel.\\n    23→ 2.  Enter DSNAME(\\'xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx\\') to the right of Source where xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx is the dump dataset name. Then enter Enter and F3 to return to the IPCS primary option menu.\\n    24→ 3.  Enter option 6 from the IPCS primary option menu to display the IPCS Subcommand Entry panel.\\n    25→ 4.  Enter IPCS command verbx dfhpdxxx \\'ke\\' where xxx is the version and release for the CICS dump. The value of xxx is 660 for CICS TS V4.1. This command will format the dump and display to the Kernel Domain KE_TASK Summary.\\n    26→ 5.  Enter f *YES* to get to the running task that had the program check. There may be more than one. In the example below, there is one task with *YES* under ERROR (KE_NUM 008E).

Make a note of the ERR_NUM associated with the program check that has an ERR_TIME matching the time the dump was taken and a KE_NUM matching the KE_NUM found in the Kernel Domain KE_TASK Summary. If there is more than one program check for the same ERR_TIME and KE_NUM, focus on the first program check. The other program checks are probably a result of the first program check.\\n    39→ 10. Enter f \\'Number: xxxxxxxx\\' where xxxxxxxx is the ERR_NUM of the program check (from Figure 1.2) you have decided to focus on.

For CICS TS V4.1 compare the addresses at offset X\\'34\\' and offset X\\'10C\\' in the KERNEL ERROR DATA. The addresses are the second word of the CICS PSW and the MVS PSW, respectively. If the addresses are different, use the MVS PSW and registers. Otherwise, use the CICS PSW and registers.\\n    44→\\n    45→     The CICS PSW starts at offset x\\'30\\' and is 3 words in length. The CICS registers, 0 through 15, start at offset X\\'48\\' and each register is 2 words in length.\\n    46→     The MVS PSW starts at offset x\\'108\\' and is 3 words in length. The MVS registers, 0 through 15, start at offset x\\'120\\' and each register is 2 words in length.\\n    47→\\n    48→\\n    49→ 12. Use F8 to scroll down to see the formatted CICS PSW and registers as shown in Figure 1.4 below. IPCS CICS VERBX will format the MVS PSW and registers if the MVS PSW is different from the CICS PSW. If the PSWs are the same as in this example, then CICS VERBX does not duplicate the information.\\n    50→\\n    51→     Figure 1.4\\n    52→     [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21424768&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21424768&aid=4]\\n    53→\\n    54→     CICS VERBX will attempt to determine the failing module from the PSW and will display the module name and offset if possible. The offline dump formatter uses more information than the original failure message, and so often, when the original failure message is unhelpful (offset FFFFFFFF in module) the dump formatter will be more informative.\\n    55→\\n    56→     By scrolling down from the panel in Figure 1.4, you will often get the failing module printed from the start to the interrupt address plus 256 bytes. CICS VERBX will also assume the values in the general registers are addresses and print the storage before and after these addresses, using both 31 bit and 24 bit addresses.\\n    57→\\n    58→Once you know the PSW, you can do the following to determine the module that the failure is occurring in:  1. Enter option 1 from the IPCS primary option menu to Browse the dump data set.\\n    59→ 2. Enter nnnnnnnn into the Pointer Address field where nnnnnnnn is the second word of the PSW. If the first digit of the PSW address is greater than 8, subtract 8 from it. In the example above, the PSW address is AE500B86. Therefore, you would use 2E500B86.\\n    60→ 3. If the storage displays, enter F7 to scroll up until you see an eye catcher for a load module. Load module names are usually followed by a date and time stamp. Calculate an offset within the module by subtracting the load point from the PSW address. This is the offset where the abend occurred.\\n    61→ 4. If \"storage not available\" displays, enter ip where nnnnnnnn. If the module has been loaded by the operating system from the LPA or Nucleus, this will display the module name and the offset within the module.\\n    62→\\n    63→Now that you know the module name and the offset, search for a known problem on the CICS Support page [http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/Other_Software/CICS_Transaction_Server].

I see this error: WTRN0047E:java.io.NotSerializableException. Anyone experienced this before?", "status": "passed", "elapsed_seconds": 92.48850512504578, "cost_usd": 0.08659845, "num_turns": 6, "answer_length": 2311, "answer": "Perfect! I found detailed information about the `WTRN0047E: java.io.NotSerializableException` error in WebSphere Application Server. Here's what the documentation says:\n\n## Problem\n\nThe `WTRN0047E: java.io.NotSerializableException` error occurs when persistent sessions or PMI (Performance Monitoring Infrastructure) is enabled, and an object that doesn't implement the `java.io.Serializable` or `java.io.Externalizable` interface is placed in the HTTPSession.\n\n**Example error:**\n```\n[10/4/02 10:11:10:172 EDT] 28b7c18b SessionContex X WTRN0047E:\njava.io.NotSerializableException: COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Connection\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe class name at the end of the exception is the object that doesn't implement the serializable interface. This object is typically:\n- An attribute placed directly into the session object, OR\n- An object referenced by an attribute of the session object\n\n## Resolution\n\n**Make the object serializable:**\n\nAll objects placed in the HTTPSession must implement the `java.io.Serializable` or `java.io.Externalizable` interface.\n\nExample:\n```java\npublic class MyObject implements Serializable {\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n**Use SessionInspectServlet to identify the problematic attribute:**\n\n1. The servlet `com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet` is already shipped with WebSphere and in the classpath\n\n2. Define a servlet/uri entry for SessionInspectServlet (or enable `ServeServletsByClassnameEnabled=true` in `ibm-web-ext.xmi`)\n\n3. Restart your web module\n\n4. Navigate your application to populate the session\n\n5. Access the SessionInspectServlet via: `webapp_context_root/servlet/com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet`\n\nThe servlet will show you:\n- All attributes in the session\n- Which attributes are serializable vs non-serializable\n- Size of each serializable attribute\n- Whether serializable attributes are properly implemented\n\n[来源: docs/ragbench-techqa/2a8bfc72.md > PROBLEM(ABSTRACT) / CAUSE / RESOLVING THE PROBLEM]\n\n---\n\n**Related APAR:** There's also a known issue (APAR PK29441) where notification code repeatedly logs `java.io.NotSerializableException` when it fails to serialize objects. This was fixed in WebSphere 6.0.2.15 and 6.1.0.3.\n\n[来源: docs/ragbench-techqa/751894c8.md > PROBLEM SUMMARY / PROBLEM CONCLUSION]", "tools_used": ["Read", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/ragbench-techqa/2a8bfc72.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/1e93192b.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/2a8bfc72.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/751894c8.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/360e1b26.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/751894c8.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/1e93192b.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/94d5f5c9.md"], "contexts_count": 4, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["there", "format", "WebSphere", "error", "about", "Application", "issue", "information", "found", "context", "detailed", "problem", "exception", "Server", "known", "occurs", "application", "perform", "Document", "typically", "object", "CONNECT"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Read", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/ragbench-techqa/2a8bfc72.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/1e93192b.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/2a8bfc72.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/751894c8.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/360e1b26.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/751894c8.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/1e93192b.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/94d5f5c9.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "judge_score": 2.0, "faithfulness": 0.4, "relevancy": -1, "judge": {"faithfulness": 0.4, "answer_relevancy": -1, "relevancy": -1, "score": 2.0, "reason": "RAGAS: faith=0.40"}, "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "1066c465-1f30-4e60-8cc9-77d64637e57f", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "failed"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "preprocess", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "preprocess", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "34f307d9-3de2-4381-9043-ebc3e1d45764", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about this Java.io.NotSerializableException error in WebSphere Application Server (WAS).\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_8kdqTEWTnwNaVrmccW8ccV', name='Bash', input={'command': '.venv/bin/python scripts/mcp_server.py hybrid_search \"Java.io.NotSerializableException WTRN0047E WebSphere WAS transaction\" 5', 'description': 'Search for NotSerializableException and WTRN0047E error in knowledge base'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_Unyq4DhHz9IT02eYLew5w6', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'NotSerializableException|WTRN0047E'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_8kdqTEWTnwNaVrmccW8ccV', content='', is_error=False)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_Unyq4DhHz9IT02eYLew5w6', content='Found 5 files\\ndocs/ragbench-techqa/1e93192b.md\\ndocs/ragbench-techqa/2a8bfc72.md\\ndocs/ragbench-techqa/751894c8.md\\ndocs/ragbench-techqa/94d5f5c9.md\\ndocs/ragbench-techqa/360e1b26.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Great!

If the storage displays, enter F7 to scroll up until you see an eye catcher for a load module. Load module names are usually followed by a date and time stamp. Calculate an offset within the module by subtracting the load point from the PSW address. This is the offset where the abend occurred.\\n    61→ 4.
