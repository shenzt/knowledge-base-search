For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3277,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis set is an unordered collection of unique strings (members).\\\\\\\\nYou can use Redis sets to efficiently:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Track unique items (e.g., track all unique IP addresses accessing a given blog post).\\\\\\\\n* Represent relations (e.g., the set of all users with a given role).\\\\\\\\n* Perform common set operations such as intersection, unions, and differences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`SADD`]() adds a new member to a set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SREM`]() removes the specified member from the set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SISMEMBER`]() tests a string for set membership.\\\\\\\\n* [`SINTER`]() returns the set of members that two or more sets have in common (i.e., the intersection).\\\\\\\\n* [`SCARD`]() returns the size (a.k.a. cardinality) of a set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of set commands](?group=set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Store the sets of bikes racing in France and the USA.

For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside?

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.501,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"It\\'s not just a matter of RTT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Request/Response server can be implemented so that it is able to process new requests even if the client hasn\\'t already read the old responses.\\\\\\\\nThis way it is possible to send *multiple commands* to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use for many decades.\\\\\\\\nFor instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has supported pipelining since its early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.\\\\\\\\nThis is an example using the raw netcat utility:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash \\\\\\\\n$ (printf \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; sleep 1) | nc localhost 6379\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time we don\\'t pay the cost of RTT for every call, but just once for the three commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be explicit, with pipelining the order of operations of our very first example will be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the client sends commands using pipelining, the server will be forced to queue the replies, using memory. So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.0149,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/streams/idempotency.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotent message processing\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotency modes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when using at-least-once delivery patterns. This feature enables reliable message submission with automatic deduplication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdempotent message processing ensures that handling the same message multiple times produces the same system state as handling it once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeginning with Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when producers resend messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProducers may need to resend messages under two scenarios:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producer-Redis network issues (disconnection and reconnection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If a disconnection occurs after the producer executes `XADD`, but before it receives the reply, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The producer crashes and restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If the producer crashes after calling `XADD` but before receiving the reply and marking a message as delivered, after a restart, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases, to guarantee that the message is added to the stream, the producer must call `XADD` again with the same message. Without idempotent message processing, a retry may result in a message being delivered twice. With idempotent message processing, producers can guarantee at-most-once production even under such scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA unique ID, called an idempotent ID or *iid*, is associated with each message that is added to a stream. \\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to assign iids:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producers provide a unique iid for each message. An iid can be some identifier already associated with this message: a transaction ID, a counter, or a UUID.\\\\\\\\n1. Redis generates an iid based on each message’s content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the same message is added to the stream more than once, the same iid would need to be provided by the producer.\\\\\\\\nFor (1), this is the producer’s responsibility, and for (2), Redis will calculate the same iid, as long as the message content hasn’t changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the [`XADD`]() command with idempotency parameters, `IDMP` or `IDMPAUTO`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # producer-1 (pid) and iid-1 (iid) are provided manually\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value        # producer-2 (pid) is provided manually, Redis provides the iid\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_eW2lEKv3avhVVQymNdnYeA', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Based on the search results, I found information about Redis Streams, but the results focus more on idempotency and pipelining rather than the core message queuing functionality.

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream.

This feature enables reliable message submission with automatic deduplication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdempotent message processing ensures that handling the same message multiple times produces the same system state as handling it once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeginning with Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when producers resend messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProducers may need to resend messages under two scenarios:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producer-Redis network issues (disconnection and reconnection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If a disconnection occurs after the producer executes `XADD`, but before it receives the reply, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The producer crashes and restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If the producer crashes after calling `XADD` but before receiving the reply and marking a message as delivered, after a restart, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases, to guarantee that the message is added to the stream, the producer must call `XADD` again with the same message. Without idempotent message processing, a retry may result in a message being delivered twice. With idempotent message processing, producers can guarantee at-most-once production even under such scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA unique ID, called an idempotent ID or *iid*, is associated with each message that is added to a stream. \\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to assign iids:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producers provide a unique iid for each message. An iid can be some identifier already associated with this message: a transaction ID, a counter, or a UUID.\\\\\\\\n1. Redis generates an iid based on each message’s content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the same message is added to the stream more than once, the same iid would need to be provided by the producer.\\\\\\\\nFor (1), this is the producer’s responsibility, and for (2), Redis will calculate the same iid, as long as the message content hasn’t changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the [`XADD`]() command with idempotency parameters, `IDMP` or `IDMPAUTO`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # producer-1 (pid) and iid-1 (iid) are provided manually\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value        # producer-2 (pid) is provided manually, Redis provides the iid\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.3764,\\\\n

This is better for time series use cases, because they are typically interested in the data during a given time window, rather than a fixed number of samples.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.814,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-057\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Key API for Stream type\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"For an introduction to streams, see [https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/streams/](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/streams/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe type `RedisModuleStreamID`, which is used in stream functions, is a struct\\\\\\\\nwith two 64-bit fields and is defined as\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    typedef struct RedisModuleStreamID {\\\\\\\\n        uint64_t ms;\\\\\\\\n        uint64_t seq;\\\\\\\\n    } RedisModuleStreamID;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee also [`RedisModule_ValueLength()`](#RedisModule_ValueLength), which returns the length of a stream, and the\\\\\\\\nconversion functions [`RedisModule_StringToStreamID()`](#RedisModule_StringToStreamID) and [`RedisModule_CreateStringFromStreamID()`](#RedisModule_CreateStringFromStreamID).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<span id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"RedisModule_StreamAdd\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></span>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6388,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"39de5f37\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"39de5f37-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.2-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisos 8.2 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Open Source 8.2-RC1 (July 2025) > Metrics\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 8.2 introduces major performance and memory footprint improvements, new commands, and command extensions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 8.2-RC1 is available as a Docker image and can be downloaded from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis).

\\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Network layer\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To communicate with the Redis server, Redis clients use a protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Let me search more specifically for Redis Streams introduction and basic usage documentation.')]"}, {"content":

\\\\\"Triggers and functions provide an API that allows to register a stream trigger. Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

`data` argument which pass to the stream consumer callback are in the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"<ms>\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<seq>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<stream name>\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n

],\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why the record is a list of touples and not an object is because the Redis Stream specifications allows duplicate keys.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotice that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS` `ArrayBuffer`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can observe the streams which are tracked by our registered consumer using `TFUNCTION LIST` command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFUNCTION LIST

access to the Redis log files, `redis.log` is a good method to use when debugging. However, there is a drawback. Redis Cloud users do not have access to the Redis log files, and it\\'s pretty common that only system administrators have access to them on self-hosted installations. Fortunately, you can also use Redis pub/sub, which will be discussed in the next section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou don\\'t have to do anything special to use `redis.log`, as it\\'s always available. Here is an example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```javascript\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=lib\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerFunction(\\'hello\\', ()=> {\\\\\\\\n  redis.log(\\'Hello log\\')\\\\\\\\n  return \\'Hello from an external file\\'\\\\\\\\n})\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter loading the library and executing the function with `TFCALL`, you\\'ll see something like the following in your Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n45718:M 01 Nov 2023 07:02:40.593 * <redisgears_2> Hello log\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you don\\'t have access to your Redis database log files, you can use pub/sub. The following example demonstrates how to use the [client.call]() API to publish to a pub/sub channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```javascript\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=lib\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nconst logChannel = \\'tfLogChannel\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nfunction publog(client, message) {\\\\\\\\n  client.call(\\'publish\\', logChannel, message)\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerFunction(\\'tflog\\', (client) => {\\\\\\\\n  publog(client, \\'sample pub/sub log message\\')\\\\\\\\n  return \\'sample\\'\\\\\\\\n})\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nIn a CLI session, subscribe to the `tfLogChannel` channel and watch for messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```redis\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> subscribe tfLogChannel\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"subscribe\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"tfLogChannel\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\nReading messages... (press Ctrl-C to quit or any key to type command)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn another CLI session, load the library, replacing what was already there, and then call the new function:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```redis\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFCALL lib.tflog 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sample\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll see the following in the previous CLI session:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```redis\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"message\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"tfLogChannel\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sample pub/sub log message\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a downside to using pub/sub. Redis pub/sub provides at-most-once message delivery semantics, which means that once a message is sent, it won\\'t be sent again. So, if a message isn\\'t consumed, it\\'s gone forever. This is likely okay for debugging, but for the longer term, `redis.log` is the better solution for log persistence.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3702,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Compare data types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Data type features > Streams\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"-   **Structure**: sequence of entries, each with a set of field-value pairs.\\\\\\\\n-   **Operations**: add, read, trim.\\\\\\\\n-   **Suitable for**: Log data, time series, and other append-only structures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStreams store sequences of entries, each with a set of field-value pairs.\\\\\\\\nThey are optimized for appending new entries and reading them in order,\\\\\\\\nand so they are useful for implementing log data, time series, and other\\\\\\\\nappend-only data structures.

With the default policy of fsync every second, write performance is still great. fsync is performed using a background thread and the main thread will try hard to perform writes when no fsync is in progress, so you can only lose one second worth of writes.\\\\\\\\n* The AOF log is an append-only log, so there are no seeks, nor corruption problems if there is a power outage. Even if the log ends with a half-written command for some reason (disk full or other reasons) the redis-check-aof tool is able to fix it easily.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is able to automatically rewrite the AOF in background when it gets too big. The rewrite is completely safe as while Redis continues appending to the old file, a completely new one is produced with the minimal set of operations needed to create the current data set, and once this second file is ready Redis switches the two and starts appending to the new one.\\\\\\\\n* AOF contains a log of all the operations one after the other in an easy to understand and parse format. You can even easily export an AOF file. For instance even if you\\'ve accidentally flushed everything using the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command, as long as no rewrite of the log was performed in the meantime, you can still save your data set just by stopping the server, removing the latest command, and restarting Redis again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF files are usually bigger than the equivalent RDB files for the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n* AOF can be slower than RDB depending on the exact fsync policy. In general with fsync set to *every second* performance is still very high, and with fsync disabled it should be exactly as fast as RDB even under high load. Still RDB is able to provide more guarantees about the maximum latency even in the case of a huge write load.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis < 7.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF can use a lot of memory if there are writes to the database during a rewrite (these are buffered in memory and written to the new AOF at the end).\\\\\\\\n* All write commands that arrive during rewrite are written to disk twice.\\\\\\\\n* Redis could freeze writing and fsyncing these write commands to the new AOF file at the end of the rewrite.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nOk, so what should I use?\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe general indication you should use both persistence methods is if\\\\\\\\nyou want a degree of data safety comparable to what PostgreSQL can provide you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you care a lot about your data, but still can live with a few minutes of\\\\\\\\ndata loss in case of disasters, you can simply use RDB alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are many users using AOF alone, but we discourage it since to have an\\\\\\\\nRDB snapshot from time to time is a great idea for doing database backups,\\\\\\\\nfor faster restarts, and in the event of bugs in the AOF engine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following sections will illustrate a few more details about the two persistence models.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_5oj7TNH23mKEp1kQlQTxUN', content='{\"result\":\"[]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Based on the search results, I found some information about Redis Streams for message queuing.

For example, for a desired false positive rate of 0.1% (1 in 1000), error_rate should be set to 0.001.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the number of items you expect having in your filter in total and is trivial when you have a static set but it becomes more challenging when your set grows over time. It\\'s important to get the number right because if you **oversize** - you\\'ll end up wasting memory. If you **undersize**, the filter will fill up and a new one will have to be stacked on top of it (sub-filter stacking). In the cases when a filter consists of multiple sub-filters stacked on top of each other latency for adds stays the same, but the latency for presence checks increases. The reason for this is the way the checks work: a regular check would first be performed on the top (latest) filter and if a negative answer is returned the next one is checked and so on. That\\'s where the added latency comes from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding an item to a Bloom filter never fails due to the data structure \\\\\\\\\\\\\"filling up\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Instead, the error rate starts to grow. To keep the error close to the one set on filter initialization, the Bloom filter will auto-scale, meaning, when capacity is reached, an additional sub-filter will be created.  \\\\\\\\n The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by `EXPANSION`. If the number of items to be stored in the filter is unknown, we recommend that you use an expansion of 2 or more to reduce the number of sub-filters. Otherwise, we recommend that you use an expansion of 1 to reduce memory consumption. The default expansion value is 2. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n The filter will keep adding more hash functions for every new sub-filter in order to keep your desired error rate. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMaybe you\\'re wondering \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why would I create a smaller filter with a high expansion rate if I know I\\'m going to scale anyway?\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; the answer is: for cases where you need to keep many filters (let\\'s say a filter per user, or per product) and most of them will stay small, but some with more activity will have to scale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you know you\\'re not going to scale use the `NONSCALING` flag because that way the filter will use one hash function less.

when:**\n- You need **nested data structures** (deeply nested fields and arrays)\n- You need **geospatial indexing/querying** with Redis query engine\n- You need to **access sub-values** without transmitting the entire object over the network\n- You need **atomic partial updates** (increment values, add/remove array elements, append strings)\n\n**Use Hashes when:**\n- You need **indexing/querying** with Redis query engine but can live without nested structures\n- You need **lower memory overhead** and faster field access than JSON\n- You need to set **expiration times on individual fields** within the document\n- You need frequent access to individual data fields with string or binary values\n\n**Use Strings when:**\n- Your fields are simple integers or bits that you can refer to by integer index\n- You need the most compact and efficient storage\n- You don't need field-level access or nested structures\n\n## Key Trade-offs\n\n**Memory & Performance:**\nJSON has the highest memory and processing requirements, followed by hashes, then strings.\n\n**JSON Advantages over serialized strings:**\n- Access nested values without retrieving the entire object\n- Atomic partial updates without reserializing the whole object\n- Native indexing and querying support via Redis Query Engine\n\n**Hash Advantages:**\n- More efficient field-level access than JSON\n- Lower memory overhead\n- Field-level expiration support\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md > Choose a data type > Documents]\n\n[来源:

The Redis implementation provides a standard error rate of 0.81% (less than 1%).\n\n**Algorithm strategy**: HyperLogLog uses a probabilistic counting algorithm that doesn't need to remember previously seen elements. It can estimate cardinality for sets with up to 2^64 (18,446,744,073,709,551,616) members.\n\n## Basic operations\n\n- **PFADD**: Add elements to the HyperLogLog (constant time and space)\n- **PFCOUNT**: Get the estimated count of unique elements (constant time and space)\n- **PFMERGE**: Combine multiple HyperLogLogs into one (O(n) where n is the number of sketches)\n\n## Example usage\n\n```redis\n> PFADD bikes Hyperion Deimos Phobes Quaoar\n(integer) 1\n> PFCOUNT bikes\n(integer) 4\n> PFADD commuter_bikes Salacia Mimas Quaoar\n(integer) 1\n> PFMERGE all_bikes bikes commuter_bikes\nOK\n> PFCOUNT all_bikes\n(integer) 6\n```\n\n## Common use cases\n\n- Counting unique visitors to web pages\n- Tracking unique queries in search forms\n- Counting unique plays of songs/videos\n- Any scenario where you need approximate unique counts with minimal memory\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md > Use cases]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/top-k.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["error rate", "hyperloglog", "cardinality", "PFADD", "list", "integer", "TS.", "probabilistic"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/top-k.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "6339df6e-29ad-479e-b7ea-d546cc11f65c", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "df93509a-78c0-4586-8a8b-742c1399c58b", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about HyperLogLog in Redis using multiple approaches.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_oi9i3zkTrRCriHc1C4Twci', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'HyperLogLog'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_m4d4EPfvDDusksmLIxVeVi', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'HyperLogLog count unique elements Redis algorithm', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_oi9i3zkTrRCriHc1C4Twci', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_m4d4EPfvDDusksmLIxVeVi', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.3672,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Use cases\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the cardinality of a set, trading perfect accuracy for efficient space utilization.

It discards some older approaches like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"count-all\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"admit-all-count-some\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in favour of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**count-with-exponential-decay**\\\\\\\\\\\\\" strategy which is biased against mouse (small) flows and has a limited impact on elephant (large) flows. This implementation uses two data structures in tandem: a hash table that holds the probabilistic counts (much like the Count-Min Sketch), and a min heap that holds the `K` items with the highest counts. This ensures high accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms allowed, while keeping memory utilization to a fraction of what is typically required by a Sorted Set. It has the additional benefit of being able to get real time notifications when elements are added or removed from the Top K list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trending hashtags (social media platforms, news distribution networks)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What are the K hashtags people have mentioned the most in the last X hours? \\\\\\\\n- What are the K news with highest read/view count today? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData flow is the incoming social media posts from which you parse out the different hashtags. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`TOPK.LIST`]() command has a time complexity of `O(K*log(k))` so if `K` is small, there is no need to keep a separate set or sorted set of all the hashtags.

For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted.

Lists 作为消息队列\n\n**基本特性：**\n- 使用 `LPUSH`/`RPUSH` 添加消息，`LPOP`/`RPOP` 消费消息\n- 实现简单的生产者-消费者模式\n- 支持阻塞操作和原子移动（`LMOVE`）\n\n**典型应用场景：**\n- 后台任务队列（如 Ruby 的 resque 和 sidekiq）\n- 社交网络的最新更新（如 Twitter 的最新推文）\n- 使用 `LTRIM` 实现固定大小的队列（Capped Lists）\n\n**局限性：**\n- 简单的先进先出（FIFO）结构\n- 消息被消费后即删除，无法重复消费\n- 不支持消费者组\n- 按消息数量限制（如保留最新 N 条）\n\n### Streams 作为消息队列\n\n**基本特性：**\n- 使用 Radix Tree 实现的索引结构（与 Lists 的链表不同）\n- 每条消息有唯一的 ID（时间戳 + 序列号）\n- 支持消费者组（Consumer Groups）\n- 消息持久化，可被多次消费\n\n**高级功能：**\n- **时间窗口保留策略**：按毫秒级时间范围保留数据（而非固定数量）\n- **实时流处理**：数据进入 stream 后立即处理\n- **幂等性支持**：通过 `IDMP`/`IDMPAUTO` 防止重复消息\n- **消费者组管理**：多个消费者协同处理，支持 ACK 机制\n\n**适用场景：**\n- 时间序列数据（关注特定时间窗口的数据）\n- 需要多消费者协同处理的场景\n- 需要消息持久化和重放的场景\n- 实时数据流处理\n\n## 核心区别总结\n\n| 特性 | Lists | Streams |\n|------|-------|---------|\n| 数据结构 | 链表 | Radix Tree 索引 |\n| 消息 ID | 无 | 时间戳 + 序列号 |\n| 消费模式 | 一次性消费 | 可重复消费 |\n| 消费者组 | 不支持 | 支持 |\n| 保留策略 | 按数量（LTRIM） | 按时间窗口 |\n| 幂等性 | 不支持 | 支持（IDMP） |\n| 适用场景 | 简单队列 | 复杂流处理 |\n\n**选择建议：**\n- 如果只需要简单的任务队列，Lists 足够且更轻量\n- 如果需要消息持久化、多消费者协同、时间窗口管理，选择 Streams\n\n---\n\n**引用来源：**\n- [来源: redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md > Examples > Capped lists]\n- [来源:

This is better for time series use cases, because they are typically interested in the data during a given time window, rather than a fixed number of samples.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.9211,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b-005\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples > Capped lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Lists are useful for a number of tasks, two very representative use cases\\\\\\\\nare the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Remember the latest updates posted by users into a social network.\\\\\\\\n* Communication between processes, using a consumer-producer pattern where the producer pushes items into a list, and a consumer (usually a *worker*) consumes those items and executes actions. Redis has special list commands to make this use case both more reliable and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example both the popular Ruby libraries [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) and\\\\\\\\n[sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) use Redis lists under the hood in order to\\\\\\\\nimplement background jobs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe popular Twitter social network [takes the latest tweets](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Real-Time-Delivery-Twitter)\\\\\\\\nposted by users into Redis lists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo describe a common use case step by step, imagine your home page shows the latest\\\\\\\\nphotos published in a photo sharing social network and you want to speedup access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time a user posts a new photo, we add its ID into a list with [`LPUSH`]().\\\\\\\\n* When users visit the home page, we use `LRANGE 0 9` in order to get the latest 10 posted items.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn many use cases we just want to use lists to store the *latest items*,\\\\\\\\nwhatever they are: social network updates, logs, or anything else.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis allows us to use lists as a capped collection, only remembering the latest\\\\\\\\nN items and discarding all the oldest items using the [`LTRIM`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`LTRIM`]() command is similar to [`LRANGE`](), but **instead of displaying the\\\\\\\\nspecified range of elements** it sets this range as the new list value. All\\\\\\\\nthe elements outside the given range are removed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you\\'re adding bikes on the end of a list of repairs, but only\\\\\\\\nwant to worry about the 3 that have been on the list the longest:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs 0 2\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above [`LTRIM`]() command tells Redis to keep just list elements from index\\\\\\\\n0 to 2, everything else will be discarded. This allows for a very simple but\\\\\\\\nuseful pattern: doing a List push operation + a List trim operation together \\\\\\\\nto add a new element and discard elements exceeding a limit. Using \\\\\\\\n[`LTRIM`]() with negative indexes can then be used to keep only the 3 most recently added:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs -3 -1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above combination adds new elements and keeps only the 3\\\\\\\\nnewest elements into the list. With [`LRANGE`]() you can access the top items\\\\\\\\nwithout any need to remember very old data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: while [`LRANGE`]() is technically an O(N) command, accessing small ranges\\\\\\\\ntowards the head or the tail of the list is a constant time operation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.1582,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-057\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Key API for Stream type\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"For an introduction to streams, see [https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/streams/](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/streams/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe type `RedisModuleStreamID`, which is used in stream functions, is a struct\\\\\\\\nwith two 64-bit fields and is defined as\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    typedef struct RedisModuleStreamID {\\\\\\\\n        uint64_t ms;\\\\\\\\n        uint64_t seq;\\\\\\\\n    } RedisModuleStreamID;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee also [`RedisModule_ValueLength()`](#RedisModule_ValueLength), which returns the length of a stream, and the\\\\\\\\nconversion functions [`RedisModule_StringToStreamID()`](#RedisModule_StringToStreamID) and [`RedisModule_CreateStringFromStreamID()`](#RedisModule_CreateStringFromStreamID).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<span id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"RedisModule_StreamAdd\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></span>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5967,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Basic commands\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists are linked lists of string values.\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are frequently used to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Implement stacks and queues.\\\\\\\\n* Build queue management for background worker systems.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`LPUSH`]() adds a new element to the head of a list; [`RPUSH`]() adds to the tail.\\\\\\\\n* [`LPOP`]() removes and returns an element from the head of a list; [`RPOP`]() does the same but from the tails of a list. \\\\\\\\n* [`LLEN`]() returns the length of a list.\\\\\\\\n* [`LMOVE`]() atomically moves elements from one list to another.\\\\\\\\n* [`LRANGE`]() extracts a range of elements from a list.\\\\\\\\n* [`LTRIM`]() reduces a list to the specified range of elements.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.0599,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4103dc5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4103dc5c-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/triggers/Stream_Triggers.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Stream triggers\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Register a stream consumer\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Triggers and functions provide an API that allows to register a stream trigger. Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

`data` argument which pass to the stream consumer callback are in the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":

],\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why the record is a list of touples and not an object is because the Redis Stream specifications allows duplicate keys.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotice that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS` `ArrayBuffer`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can observe the streams which are tracked by our registered consumer using `TFUNCTION LIST` command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFUNCTION LIST

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To communicate with the Redis server, Redis clients use a protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.5467,\\\\n
