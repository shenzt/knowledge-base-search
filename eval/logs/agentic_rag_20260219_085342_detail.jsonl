To do this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Go to: Start > Run and type \\'%temp%\\' to navigate to the temporary path for Windows Installer programs. Delete all contents within this folder.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Run the installer executable (SPSS_Modeler_141_win64.exe) as normal. When it finishes extracting and decompressing the .msi file and the end-user is required to click \\'Continue\\', minimise this window.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Switch to the %temp% folder and locate the folder with the \\'ModelerClient64.msi\\' file. Copy ALL contents within this folder and paste it to a local folder (e.g. C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Temp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Modeler\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ClientInstall).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Once copied, switch back to the installation wizard and hit \\'Cancel\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStep 2: Use the command prompt to execute the \\'MsiExec\\' command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Open a command prompt window as an Administrator and run the following command: (substitute <path> with the location of your .msi file)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMsiExec.exe /i \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<path>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ModelerClient.msi\\\\\\\\\\\\\" /qn /L*v logfile.txt INSTALLDIR=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\IBM\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\SPSS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Modeler\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\14\\\\\\\\\\\\\" LICENSETYPE=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Network\\\\\\\\\\\\\" LSHOST=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mylicserver\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* For a full list of Silent Install options, please refer to the \\'NetworkLicenseAdministratorsGuide.pdf\\' > \\'Installaing the Product on the Local Desktop Computers > Pushing an Installation to Windows Computers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce that you have confirmed that Modeler Client is operational, repeat the steps to extract the .msi file for Modeler Client Fix Pack 1. Please note that it is highly recommended to delete the contents of the temporary folder as the Fix Pack and Client installations use the same file names. This is to prevent the accidental copying of the Client installation instead of the Fix Pack install.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Need more help? Our Modeler forum is Live!

Accessing the.msi file for IBM SPSS Statistics is dependent upon the installation media you have received.\\\\\\\\nUsing the Software Download:\\\\\\\\n1. Download and save the installer executable (e.g. \\'SPSS_Statistics_24_win64.exe\\') to a known, accessible location on the computer hard drive.\\\\\\\\n2. Next, you will need to use the /b switch from your command prompt to extract the .msi file.\\\\\\\\nIn the example below the SPSS_Statistics_24_win64.exe was downloaded to the C: drive.\\\\\\\\nProvide the file location for the extraction. This example uses the directory \\\\\\\\\\\\\"MSItest\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on the C: drive:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nC:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\>SPSS_Statistics_24_win64.exe /b\\\\\\\\\\\\\"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\MSItest\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. Notice that running this command will launch the InstallShield Wizard. Let this run until the .msi has been extracted. You will see \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Extracting: IBM SPSS Statistics 24.msi\\\\\\\\\\\\\" message from the installer. You do not need to proceed with the full installation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing Installation Media (CD/DVD)\\\\\\\\n1. Insert the disk.\\\\\\\\n2. IF prompted to install the software, select \\'Cancel\\'.\\\\\\\\n3. Browse to the media location.\\\\\\\\n4. Open the \\'SPSSStatistics\\' folder.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe 32-bit MSI file will be located in the \\'win32\\'. folder.\\\\\\\\nThe 64-bit MSI file will be located in the \\'win64\\' folder.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing a compressed (.zip) file\\\\\\\\n1. Extract (decompress) the contents of the ZIP file into a designated folder.\\\\\\\\n2. The MSI folder will located in the designated folder.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor documentation on IBM SPSS-specific commands for use with MSI files, see \\'Administrator\\'s Guide\\' appropriate to your license type (e.g. \\'Site\\', \\'Concurrent\\' Users Guide\\').\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRELATED INFORMATION\\\\\\\\n Need more help?

Prior to use of IM, the fixpacks for IHS (V7 and V6.x) did not include files expected to be customized such as default static content files like index.html and other HTML, GIF, and ICO files installed by IHS to its <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs directory. More importantly the admin.passwd file (that holds the user/passsword for the IHS Admin Service) is usually configured right after install when using the Plugin Configration Tool (PCT).\\n    14→\\n    15→Prior to use of IM you could not install directly to a fixpack level. You had to install the base GA code (i.e. 7.0.0.0 or 6.1.0.0) and then use the Update Installer to apply fixpacks. IM supports installation directly to a fixpack level therefore all install files included with the base GA code 8.0.0.0 are applied with the fixpack. Any files that should not be overwritten must be listed in a exception list (of non-serviceable files) that the IM installer can reference. This list of non-serviceable files was ommitted or incomplete for IHS V8.0.0.0 and 8.5.0.0 so the install of the first fixpack (regardless of fixpack level) may overwrite files such as admin.passwd and index.html.\\n    16→\\n    17→There are two APAR related to the same event:\\n    18→.\\n    19→PM71612: ADDITIONAL NON-SERVICEABLE FILES ADDED FOR IBM HTTP SERVER.\\n    20→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM71612 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM71612]\\n    21→.\\n    22→PM63634: IHS CONFIG ADMIN.PASSWD FILE WAS RESET AFTER INSTALLING\\n    23→FIXPACK 3 ON WAS 8.0.0.2 or 7.0.0.25 on Windows.\\n    24→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM63634 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM63634]\\n    25→\\n    26→.\\n    27→The technote about PM63634: IHS CONFIG ADMIN.PASSWD FILE WAS RESET advises a resolution in reseting the admin.passwd file:\\n    28→\\n    29→Installation of IBM HTTP Server 7.0.0.25, 8.0.0.1, 8.0.0.2, 8.0.0.3 will overlay admin.passwd:\\n    30→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593118 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593118]\\n    31→\\n    32→The main impact is that the IHS admin.passwd file gets overwritten which means the IHS Admin User/PW must be reset with the htpasswd utility in the IHS bin directory. Some customers customize the IHS splash page (index.html) or other default pages provided by IHS install so apply of first fixpack can overwrite these files and the customer\\'s customization.\\n    33→\\n    34→The list of these non-serviceable files where included in 8.0.0.5 and 8.5.0.1 per the APAR links above so once that fixpack level is applied then any future fixpacks will not overwrite these files. There is no way to avoid the event if GA 8.0.0.0/8.5.0.0 IHS is installed first. The first fixpack applied (of any fixpack) could replace the files.\\n    35→\\n    36→This Technote defines three recommendations to avoid the problem.\\n    37→\\n    38→SYMPTOM\\n    39→- The admin.passwd is a zero byte file after apply of fixpack\\n    40→\\n    41→ - Any content installed under <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs by IHS install (default static content files) that have been customized are replaced by their default originals after apply of fixpack\\n    42→\\n    43→CAUSE\\n    44→Files not marked as non-serviceable files for IM install of fixpacks for IHS per APAR PM71612\\n    45→\\n    46→ENVIRONMENT\\n    47→WebSphere environments that use IHS v8.x to run the WSAS plugin for Webservers to act as proxy front to WSAS appservers.\\n    48→\\n    49→RESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\n    50→Support suggests one of three recommendations to avoid the problem:\\n    51→\\n    52→1. Use IM to install IHS at fixpack 8.0.0.5/8.5.0.1 or higher bypassing the install of 8.0.0.0/8.5.0.0\\n    53→\\n    54→2. Do not use PCT, configure IHS Admin or use htpasswd (or other customization/config) until after fixpack has been applied.\\n    55→\\n    56→3. If you have already installed 8.0.0.0 or 8.5.0.0 then before you apply your first IHS fixpack backup these files:\\n    57→\\n    58→- admin.passwd\\n    59→\\n    60→- all content under <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs\\n    61→\\n    62→\\n    63→\\n    64→PRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\\n    65→ IHS\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

WSVR0605W warnings are thrown in the log files and traces.\\n    14→\\n    15→SYMPTOM\\n    16→Message processing, that is related to event-sequenced operations, stops. After handling several messages, further messages wait in the Service Component Architecture (SCA) bus queues and event-sequenced es-workmanager hung-thread WSVR0605W warnings are seen in the log files and traces. The entire process of event-sequenced messages in the system is effectively blocked.\\n    17→\\n    18→The following code is an example of an es-workmanager hung-thread warning:\\n    19→\\n    20→[01/01/11 12:00:37:844 CEST] 0000000d ThreadMonitor W WSVR0605W: Thread \"WorkManager.es-workmanager : 9\" (0000012e) has been active for 602495 milliseconds and may be hung.

This event-sequencing thread pool is named \"es-workmanager,\" by default, and it is configured during the profile creation process. The startWork method behavior is that the method is blocked until the work is placed in the thread pool and then returned. The work is later run asynchronously. If there are not enough threads available in the es-workmanager thread pool, the startWork call to the work manager is blocked indefinitely and the WSVR0605W es-workmanager hung-thread warnings are thrown. With each warning, the number of blocked threads increases.\\n    38→\\n    39→RESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\n    40→To resolve the problem, you must tune the thread pool size for the es-workmanager thread pool. By default, the es-workmanager thread pool is created with a minimum of 2 threads and a maximum of 20 threads. Also, the Growable option is set to true, which means that the number of threads can go beyond the maximum, if needed. When the defaults are used, this issue should not happen because the thread pool can grow, if necessary. However, in certain situations, it might be necessary to limit and tune the maximum thread pool size. In these situations, individual performance tuning is necessary to prevent blocked threads. You can tune es-workmanager thread-pool properties in a pre-production test environment to avoid performance problems on a production server.\\n    41→\\n    42→You can access the configuration for work managers in the administrative console under Resources > Asynchronous beans > Work managers > es-workmanager. The task of configuring work managers is also described in the Configuring work managers [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/asyncbns/tasks/tasb_workmanager.html] topic within the information center:\\n    43→\\n    44→RELATED INFORMATION\\n    45→#WebSphere Process Server V7.0 Information Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dmndhelp/v7r0mx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.wps.doc/welcome_wps.html]\\n    46→\\n    47→\\n    48→\\n    49→PRODUCT ALIAS/SYNONYM\\n    50→ WPS\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Names longer than this will result in compile-time errors.\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/12f1979e.md]\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **The documents mention these issues but do not provide specific format requirements or guidelines for COBOL copybooks to be used with WTX typetree imports.** The knowledge base doesn't contain detailed documentation about:\n- Required copybook format specifications for WTX\n- How to prevent fields from being missing in typetree\n- Specific formatting rules beyond the 30-character field name limit\n\nFor detailed copybook format requirements specific to WTX typetree

Note: Key exportability is immutable and determined at creation time.\n\n3. **HSMs must share internal key-wrapping keys** (synchronized using `hsm-clone-kwk` command)\n\n## For Same Appliance Export/Import\n\nIf restoring exported keys to the same appliance, you don't need to worry about `hsm-clone-kwk`, red keys, or the `hsm-domain` parameter, since the key-wrapping key remains the same.\n\n## For Different Appliance Export/Import\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize both HSMs in the same key sharing domain**:\n   - Both must be in the same mode (Security Level 2 or Security Level 3)\n   - Security Level 2: Use same `hsm-domain` parameter during `hsm-reinit`\n   - Security Level 3: Use same red PED key during `hsm-reinit`\n\n2. **Ensure key is exportable** (set at keygen time with `exportable` parameter)\n\n3. **Synchronize key-wrapping keys** using `hsm-clone-kwk` command:\n   - Run 4 times total (alternating between source and destination)\n   - Each run needs the output file from the previous step\n   - Files must be moved manually (usually with `copy` command)\n\n4. **Execute** `crypto-export` and `crypto-import` sequence\n\n⚠️ **Important**: Non-HSM appliances can only export keys immediately at keygen time, never at a later time.\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/9741c198.md]", "tools_used": ["Bash", "Read", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths":

For key export to work, various conditions must be met:\\n    17→\\n    18→ * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines\\n    19→ * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen\\'s exportable option)\\n    20→ * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\\n    21→\\n    22→Each HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don\\'t need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :-\\n    23→\\n    24→First, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization).\\n    25→\\n    26→Second, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command\\'s exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable.\\n    27→\\n    28→Finally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command).\\n    29→\\n    30→Once all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import.\\n    31→\\n    32→Note that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time.\\n    33→\\n    34→For additional information refer to the online Info Center [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wsdatap/v3r8m2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for \"PIN entry device\".\\n    35→\\n    36→Note: You will need to sign into the documentation portal with your IBM Registration ID and password.\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

Can it be directed to a shared (NFS) space? 17:40 What is the difference between WAS installation through IM and Silent mode installation? 19:21 How to import license from RAD 7.0 to 8.5.5 (trial version)? 19:51 Can you please give an overview of using IM to install ifix? 20:38 I have WAS ND 8.5.5 32-bit installed on a 32-bit linux server, and I have a new linux 64bit server that we want only the 64bit 8.5.5 WAS, and use the DMGR on the 32-bit server, how do we do this? 22:14 Why is IBM only providing Installation of WebSphere Application Server through Installation Mananger? 23:01 When we go for Ifix and when we go for fixpack, what is basic difference between those? 23:50 Can you pleasee give information about what is the use of Liberty profile and its advantages? 24:57 What do you recommend if there is a need to duplicate the WebSphere environment? 26:54 What are the basic pre-req checks for installation of Installation Manager? 28:19 Do you have a link for how to federate the 64-bit WAS ND APPSERVER to 32-bit DMGR, instructions/step (jython scripting) so it can be automated? 29:20 With WebSphere products changing the method of installation, is there a white paper, or recommended practices, for setting up a central repository? 30:33 Is there any way make a WAS back-up through Installation Manager? 30:52 Do we have to uninstall previous ifix before installing latest fix pack? 32:09 We are planning to migrate from WAS 6.1 to WAS8.5.5, can I install 8.5.5 on top of the existing 6.1 profile? Or does it have to be a fresh installation? 33:10 I have an NFS share on 3 servers and IIM is installed there. Can I utilize IIM to install/uninstall with 2 different users without any issues on all 3 servers? 34:44 Is there a document for migrating WebSphere 7 to WAS 8.7 entire cell, say node-by-node? 35:11 What provisions does WebSphere Application Server provide to prevent denial of service attacks? 35:40 If we have 32-bit 8.5.5 DMGR and 1 APPSRVR 32-bit 8.5.5 and a 2nd APPSRVR 64-bit 8.5.5, does the DMGR have to be updated first or can we update the APPServers first? That is, does the order matter for fixes? 36:58 Is it a good idea to create any dependency on the dmgr for runtime? For example, Adobe Life Cycle installed on top of WAS uses some cache mechanism called gds, gemfire, etc. 37:42 I noticed on IM with 8.5 that when you choose to install the updates, it always goes through your IBM PA account to get the updates and the latest. But with Maximo application for instance, you only want to go to 8.5.0.1 for instance, so the only way I found is run the update pointing to the repository for fix 1, and choose update and keep clicking cancel to look online to continue and install the fix 1. Is this the only way to install a fix on V8 or V8.5? 39:40 When migrating WAS from 6.1 to 8.5, do you guys recommend using the migration tool or create configurations using scripts? 40:44 To upgrade websphere from 6.1 to 8.5, What path do you suggest: fresh install or migration proces?. If you suggest migration process where can I get the documentation? 42:34 To get to WAS 8.0 from WAS 8.1, is this a migration process only? 42:57 What is the latest fix pack available on top of 8.5.5.0 base (and location to down load from Passport Advantage)? 43:37 Is there a fixed release scheduled for FixPacks? I hear that it\\'s every 3 months or so. 44:24 If I have 1000 servers to apply FP, whats the recommended method to apply fixes to large number of servers in minimum time; any tools available? 47:01 I have IIM, WASND, WAS installed and configured per application\\'s requirement. Now, I want to install another instance of WAS. Does IIM have an option to take the existing WAS as a template so that I can get the configuration also? 47:49 We are planning to upgrade from 6.1 to 8.5.5.0. What\\'s the stable version (already being used by companies)? 48:45 Closing remarks 50:05 End of Call\\n    30→Panel of Experts: Jeanette Daly WebSphere Application Server L2 Support Mike Hill WebSphere Application Server L2 Support Vishavpal Shergill WebSphere Application Server L2 Support Vikram Thommandru WebSphere Application Server L2 Support\\n    31→\\n    32→PRESENTATION\\n    33→[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-12122013-AskTheExperts-WebSphere_Application_Server_installation_update_uninstall.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27040108&aid=2]WSTE-12122013-AskTheExperts-WebSphere_Application_Server_installation_update_uninstall.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27040108&aid=1]\\n    34→\\n    35→Get Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\\n    36→\\n    37→AUDIO\\n    38→[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this conference call, click on Download Audio [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/December-12-2013-Daly-Hill-Shergill-Thommandru.mp3](audio in MP3 format).

The most relevant document is from the IBM Financial Transaction Manager documentation which discusses IIB fix pack considerations. Let me provide you with the information I found:\n\n---\n\n## Important Considerations for Installing IIB Fix Packs in Multi-Instance Environments\n\nBased on the documentation in the knowledge base, here are the key points regarding IIB fix pack installation:\n\n### Installation and Verification Tasks\n\n⚠️ **The knowledge base documents mention IIB fix pack installation in the context of related products, but do not provide detailed step-by-step installation procedures specifically for multi-instance broker configurations.**\n\nFrom the available documentation, the following general considerations are mentioned:\n\n**Known Issues with IIB Fix Packs** (from FTM documentation):\n- IIB version 9.0.0.x users may experience BIP2930E errors when deploying or restarting the broker after fix pack installation\n- The fix for this issue (APAR IT06286) is available in IIB Maintenance Level 9.0.0.4\n- IIB 9.0.0.3 users may encounter BIP2503E errors with SHARED variable locks\n- The fix (APAR IT07974) is available in IIB Maintenance Level 9.0.0.4\n- IIB 9.0.0.5 has issues with REFERENCE variables after PROPAGATE operations\n- The fix (APAR IT14426) is available in IIB Maintenance Level 9.0.0.6\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/618a770c.md > Known issues]\n\n### Rollback Capability\n\n**Yes, rollback is possible.** The documentation mentions:\n\n\"To rollback to the previous version of FTM:\n- Use the normal SMP/E process to revert to a previous version\n- Restore the backup taken during the Database migration step\n- Revert to the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit workspace taken during the installation steps\n- Re-deploy the application bar files\"\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/618a770c.md > Uninstalling if necessary]\n\n### General Fix Pack Best Practices\n\nFrom the Operational Decision Manager documentation (which shares similar IBM middleware architecture):\n\n**Before Updating:**\n- Stop all server services and background services\n- Back up relevant modules and configuration files\n- Document and automate customizations using scripts\n- Ensure you have sufficient disk space (200MB+ mentioned for some products)\n- Review open APARs and known issues before installation\n\n**During Installation:**\n- Uninstall any interim fixes before installing the fix pack\n- Stop sample/test servers during installation\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/08ceb9a6.md > BEFORE UPDATING, UPDATING]\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **Important Gap in Documentation**: The knowledge base documents do not contain specific procedures for:\n- Multi-instance broker-specific installation steps\n- Verification tasks for multi-instance configurations\n- Coordination procedures between active and standby broker instances during fix pack application\n\nFor detailed multi-instance broker procedures, you should refer to the official IBM Integration Bus Knowledge Center or IBM Support documentation specific to your IIB version.", "tools_used": ["Bash",

MQ version 7.0 introduced a new feature, conversation sharing. Are there any special values on DataPower when configuring conversation sharing?", "status": "passed", "elapsed_seconds": 977.1689763069153, "cost_usd": 0.3221714, "num_turns": 16, "answer_length": 2305, "answer": "Perfect! I found the relevant document. Let me provide the answer based on the documentation.\n\n## Answer\n\nBased on the knowledge base, here's when you should use conversation sharing in DataPower MQ queue managers:\n\n**Overview:**\nIBM WebSphere MQ version 7.0 introduced the conversation sharing (SHARECNV) feature on SVRCONN channels. DataPower can configure this feature since it uses client connections with queue manager SVRCONN channels.\n\n**Three Configuration Cases:**\n\n**Case #1: Negotiated value = 0 (Disable conversation sharing)**\n- Set Sharing Conversations to 0 or 1 in DataPower mq-qm object\n- Channel runs in WebSphere MQ V6 mode without V7 features (no heartbeating, read-ahead, client asynchronous consume)\n- **Recommended for:** DataPower firmware 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier\n\n**Case #2: Negotiated value = 1 (Single conversation with V7 features)**\n- Set Sharing Conversations to 1 in DataPower mq-qm object\n- Enable \"Share Single Conversation\" attribute (visible only when Sharing Conversations = 1)\n- Set SHARECNV=1 on MQ SVRCONN channel\n- **Benefits:** Uses WebSphere MQ V7 read-ahead and new buffer management for MQGET API calls\n- **Best for:** Mixed message sizes processed by the same mq-qm object (prevents buffer depletion)\n- **Recommended for:** Firmware 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later\n\n**Case #3: Negotiated value ≥ 2 (Multiple conversations)**\n- Set Sharing Conversations to 2 or more in DataPower and on MQ SVRCONN\n- **Performance note:** 15% slower on average compared to SHARECNV(0)\n- **Recommended for:** Firmware 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later (use value ≤ 10)\n\n**Special DataPower Values:**\n- Default value in DataPower mq-qm object: 0\n- **Important:** In current DataPower firmware, setting Sharing Conversations to 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server (unless \"Share Single Conversation\" is enabled)\n- The negotiated value is the lower of DataPower and MQ SVRCONN settings\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- Apply APAR IV24821 to WebSphere MQ server (included in MQ V7.0.1.10+, V7.1.0.3+, V7.5.0.1+, V8+)\n\n⚠️ **Warning:** For DataPower firmware 7.2.0.x and earlier, use Case #1 only. Cases #2 and #3 may cause device reload/hang with MQ errors (Reason Code 2009, 2059).\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/ba7b5156.md > TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING) > RESOLVING THE PROBLEM]", "tools_used":

However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\\n    19→\\n    20→There are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object:\\n    21→\\n    22→Case #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\\n    23→\\n    24→· Administrator stop-quiesce\\n    25→· Heartbeating\\n    26→· Read ahead\\n    27→· Client asynchronous consume\\n    28→\\n    29→Set a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\n    30→\\n    31→Case #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.\\n    32→\\n    33→Set a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \"on\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\n    34→\\n    35→The Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when \"Sharing Conversations\" is configured with value of \"1\" and then <RETURN> key is entered.

However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\\n    46→\\n    47→When using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server\\'s allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\\n    48→\\n    49→For DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059.\\n    50→\\n    51→Cases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.\\n    52→\\n    53→Note: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] (\"Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread\") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server.

Prior to use of IM, the fixpacks for IHS (V7 and V6.x) did not include files expected to be customized such as default static content files like index.html and other HTML, GIF, and ICO files installed by IHS to its <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs directory. More importantly the admin.passwd file (that holds the user/passsword for the IHS Admin Service) is usually configured right after install when using the Plugin Configration Tool (PCT).\\n    14→\\n    15→Prior to use of IM you could not install directly to a fixpack level. You had to install the base GA code (i.e. 7.0.0.0 or 6.1.0.0) and then use the Update Installer to apply fixpacks. IM supports installation directly to a fixpack level therefore all install files included with the base GA code 8.0.0.0 are applied with the fixpack. Any files that should not be overwritten must be listed in a exception list (of non-serviceable files) that the IM installer can reference. This list of non-serviceable files was ommitted or incomplete for IHS V8.0.0.0 and 8.5.0.0 so the install of the first fixpack (regardless of fixpack level) may overwrite files such as admin.passwd and index.html.\\n    16→\\n    17→There are two APAR related to the same event:\\n    18→.\\n    19→PM71612: ADDITIONAL NON-SERVICEABLE FILES ADDED FOR IBM HTTP SERVER.\\n    20→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM71612 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM71612]\\n    21→.\\n    22→PM63634: IHS CONFIG ADMIN.PASSWD FILE WAS RESET AFTER INSTALLING\\n    23→FIXPACK 3 ON WAS 8.0.0.2 or 7.0.0.25 on Windows.\\n    24→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM63634 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM63634]\\n    25→\\n    26→.\\n    27→The technote about PM63634: IHS CONFIG ADMIN.PASSWD FILE WAS RESET advises a resolution in reseting the admin.passwd file:\\n    28→\\n    29→Installation of IBM HTTP Server 7.0.0.25, 8.0.0.1, 8.0.0.2, 8.0.0.3 will overlay admin.passwd:\\n    30→http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593118 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21593118]\\n    31→\\n    32→The main impact is that the IHS admin.passwd file gets overwritten which means the IHS Admin User/PW must be reset with the htpasswd utility in the IHS bin directory. Some customers customize the IHS splash page (index.html) or other default pages provided by IHS install so apply of first fixpack can overwrite these files and the customer\\'s customization.\\n    33→\\n    34→The list of these non-serviceable files where included in 8.0.0.5 and 8.5.0.1 per the APAR links above so once that fixpack level is applied then any future fixpacks will not overwrite these files. There is no way to avoid the event if GA 8.0.0.0/8.5.0.0 IHS is installed first. The first fixpack applied (of any fixpack) could replace the files.\\n    35→\\n    36→This Technote defines three recommendations to avoid the problem.\\n    37→\\n    38→SYMPTOM\\n    39→- The admin.passwd is a zero byte file after apply of fixpack\\n    40→\\n    41→ - Any content installed under <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs by IHS install (default static content files) that have been customized are replaced by their default originals after apply of fixpack\\n    42→\\n    43→CAUSE\\n    44→Files not marked as non-serviceable files for IM install of fixpacks for IHS per APAR PM71612\\n    45→\\n    46→ENVIRONMENT\\n    47→WebSphere environments that use IHS v8.x to run the WSAS plugin for Webservers to act as proxy front to WSAS appservers.\\n    48→\\n    49→RESOLVING THE PROBLEM\\n    50→Support suggests one of three recommendations to avoid the problem:\\n    51→\\n    52→1.

But with Oracle Database 12c, after restarting the database, simply run datapatch from the OPatch directory:\\n    56→\\n    57→ cd $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch\\n    58→\\n    59→ ./datapatch -verbose\\n    60→\\n    61→\\n    62→\\n    63→Now, the customer is saying that they installed a fresh new Oracle 12c and then patched the server. Then they created the database and ran select * from dba_registry_sqlpatch and no record was found. That because they did not run the datapatch step. The customer then questioned whether they need to run datapatch or not since this database is created after the server patch. That is a good question.\\n    64→\\n    65→Let\\'s look at the possible scenario.\\n    66→\\n    67→If you don\\'t run datapatch, then dba_registry_sqlpatch will have 0 row. There is no way for Guardium\\'s Vulnerability Assessment to know if you really did patch the database or not as there is no other way to find this information by doing a JDBC connection. That is why when the Guardium test ran, it showed \"Unsupported CVE database patch detected\" as Guardium found nothing or potentially something that Guardium does not recognize and would not be able to parse it. Guardium cannot simply fail the test as failing it may or may not be the desired result. One can argue that I don\\'t need to run datapatch because this database is created after the server was patched. This assumption may or may not be correct depending on how the database is created.\\n    68→\\n    69→Therefore, Guardium recommends running the datapatch step regardless. Also this is an abnormal case where it would only happen during the first few months of your database creation. After that, you would need to patch your database on a quarterly basis to satisfy Oracle security, so you will have to run datapatch each time.\\n    70→\\n    71→In an Oracle database, when the server is patched and a new database is created, here is what happens in dba_registry_sqlpatch\\n    72→\\n    73→\\n    74→\\n    75→ SELECT VERSION, FLAGS, DESCRIPTION, BUNDLE_ID, BUNDLE_SERIES\\n    76→\\n    77→ FROM DBA_REGISTRY_SQLPATCH\\n    78→\\n    79→ WHERE ACTION = \\'APPLY\\'\\n    80→\\n    81→ AND STATUS = \\'SUCCESS\\'\\n    82→\\n    83→ AND VERSION = (SELECT SUBSTR(VERSION,1,LENGTH(VERSION) -2) FROM V$INSTANCE)\\n    84→\\n    85→ AND FLAGS LIKE \\'%B%\\'\\n    86→\\n    87→ AND ACTION_TIME = (SELECT MAX(ACTION_TIME)\\n    88→\\n    89→ FROM DBA_REGISTRY_SQLPATCH\\n    90→\\n    91→ WHERE ACTION = \\'APPLY\\'\\n    92→\\n    93→ AND STATUS = \\'SUCCESS\\'\\n    94→\\n    95→ AND VERSION = (SELECT SUBSTR(VERSION,1,LENGTH(VERSION) -2) FROM V$INSTANCE)\\n    96→\\n    97→ AND FLAGS LIKE \\'%B%\\');\\n    98→\\n    99→\\n   100→\\n   101→ SELECT VERSION, FLAGS, DESCRIPTION, BUNDLE_ID, BUNDLE_SERIES\\n   102→\\n   103→ FROM DBA_REGISTRY_SQLPATCH\\n   104→\\n   105→ WHERE ACTION = \\'APPLY\\'\\n   106→\\n   107→ AND STATUS = \\'SUCCESS\\'\\n   108→\\n   109→ AND VERSION = (SELECT SUBSTR(VERSION,1,LENGTH(VERSION) -2) FROM V$INSTANCE)\\n   110→\\n   111→ AND FLAGS LIKE \\'%J%\\'\\n   112→\\n   113→ AND ACTION_TIME = (SELECT MAX(ACTION_TIME)\\n   114→\\n   115→ FROM DBA_REGISTRY_SQLPATCH\\n   116→\\n   117→ WHERE ACTION = \\'APPLY\\'\\n   118→\\n   119→ AND STATUS = \\'SUCCESS\\'\\n   120→\\n   121→ AND VERSION = (SELECT SUBSTR(VERSION,1,LENGTH(VERSION) -2) FROM V$INSTANCE)\\n   122→\\n   123→ AND FLAGS LIKE \\'%J%\\');\\n   124→\\n   125→\\n   126→\\n   127→ VERSION FLAGS DESCRIPTION BUNDLE_ID BUNDLE_SERIES\\n   128→\\n   129→ ---------- -------- -------------- ------------ ----------------\\n   130→\\n   131→ 0 record(s) selected [Fetch MetaData: 0ms] [Fetch Data: 0ms]\\n   132→\\n   133→[Executed: 7/12/2016 12:55:47 PM] [Execution: 25ms]\\n   134→\\n   135→\\n   136→\\n   137→VERSION FLAGS DESCRIPTION BUNDLE_ID BUNDLE_SERIES\\n   138→\\n   139→ ---------- -------- -------------- ------------ ----------------\\n   140→\\n   141→0 record(s) selected [Fetch MetaData: 0ms] [Fetch Data: 0ms]\\n   142→\\n   143→\\n   144→\\n   145→After running datapatch.\\n   146→\\n   147→\\n   148→\\n   149→ SELECT VERSION, FLAGS, DESCRIPTION, BUNDLE_ID, BUNDLE_SERIES\\n   150→\\n   151→ FROM DBA_REGISTRY_SQLPATCH\\n   152→\\n   153→ WHERE ACTION = \\'APPLY\\'\\n   154→\\n   155→ AND STATUS = \\'SUCCESS\\'\\n   156→\\n   157→ AND VERSION = (SELECT SUBSTR(VERSION,1,LENGTH(VERSION) -2) FROM V$INSTANCE)\\n   158→\\n   159→ AND FLAGS LIKE \\'%B%\\'\\n   160→\\n   161→ AND ACTION_TIME = (SELECT MAX(ACTION_TIME)\\n   162→\\n   163→ FROM DBA_REGISTRY_SQLPATCH\\n   164→\\n   165→ WHERE ACTION = \\'APPLY\\'\\n   166→\\n   167→ AND STATUS = \\'SUCCESS\\'\\n   168→\\n   169→ AND VERSION = (SELECT SUBSTR(VERSION,1,LENGTH(VERSION) -2) FROM V$INSTANCE)\\n   170→\\n   171→ AND FLAGS LIKE \\'%B%\\');\\n   172→\\n   173→\\n   174→\\n   175→ SELECT VERSION, FLAGS, DESCRIPTION, BUNDLE_ID, BUNDLE_SERIES\\n   176→\\n   177→ FROM DBA_REGISTRY_SQLPATCH\\n   178→\\n   179→ WHERE ACTION = \\'APPLY\\'\\n   180→\\n   181→ AND STATUS = \\'SUCCESS\\'\\n   182→\\n   183→ AND VERSION = (SELECT SUBSTR(VERSION,1,LENGTH(VERSION) -2) FROM V$INSTANCE)\\n   184→\\n   185→ AND FLAGS LIKE \\'%J%\\'\\n   186→\\n   187→ AND ACTION_TIME = (SELECT MAX(ACTION_TIME)\\n   188→\\n   189→ FROM DBA_REGISTRY_SQLPATCH\\n   190→\\n   191→ WHERE ACTION = \\'APPLY\\'\\n   192→\\n   193→ AND STATUS = \\'SUCCESS\\'\\n   194→\\n   195→ AND VERSION = (SELECT SUBSTR(VERSION,1,LENGTH(VERSION) -2) FROM V$INSTANCE)\\n   196→\\n   197→ AND FLAGS LIKE \\'%J%\\');\\n   198→\\n   199→\\n   200→\\n   201→VERSION FLAGS DESCRIPTION BUNDLE_ID BUNDLE_SERIES\\n   202→\\n   203→ ---------- -------- ------------------------------------------------------- ------------ ----------------\\n   204→\\n   205→ 12.1.0.2 NB WINDOWS DB BUNDLE PATCH 12.1.0.2.160119(64bit):22310559 160119 PSU\\n   206→\\n   207→ 1 record(s) selected [Fetch MetaData: 0ms] [Fetch Data: 0ms]\\n   208→\\n   209→\\n   210→\\n   211→VERSION FLAGS DESCRIPTION BUNDLE_ID BUNDLE_SERIES\\n   212→\\n   213→--------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------ ----------------\\n   214→\\n   215→ 12.1.0.2 UJJ WINDOWS ORACLE JAVAVM COMPONENT BUNDLE PATCH 12.1.0.2.160119(64bit):22311086 (null) (null)\\n   216→\\n   217→ 1 record(s) selected [Fetch MetaData: 0ms] [Fetch Data: 1ms]\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

MQ/JMS Import sends the MQ/JMS Request message and in the same transaction it also puts a correlation message to a Service Integration Bus (SIBus) Queue.\\n   126→\\n   127→\\n   128→ 2.

The response listener waits for a maximum of 6 seconds for the correlation message to become available before throwing the exception that you see.\\n   132→\\n   133→\\n   134→ 4. The MQ/JMS response message is then subject to the MQ retry and backout configuration as you have defined.\\n   135→\\n   136→Therefore, a possible cause for this error is a delay in the SIBus message being committed and becoming available. This scenario might be caused by performance issues of the underlying database used by SIBus.\\n   137→\\n   138→To handle such situations you have the following options:\\n   139→ 1. For the MQ/JMS Import, JMS callback destination has the default of persistence (Application). The MQ/JMS Import sends the correlation message as PERSISTENT; therefore, the message is persistent.\\n   140→\\n   141→\\n   142→    MQ/JMS Callback Connection Factory uses the default Quality of Service for persistent, so it maps persistent to \"Reliable Persistence\" for SIBus.\\n   143→\\n   144→\\n   145→    You can try changing this to \"Assured Persistent,\" which drives the persistence of the message on the same thread as the commit call.\\n   146→\\n   147→\\n   148→ 2. Increase the retry values on the WebSphere MQ backout threshold and listener port to optimum values. In this case, the message is tried more than once before being sent to the backout queue.\\n   149→\\n   150→\\n   151→ 3. Tune the database used by SIBus to avoid any performance issue.\\n   152→    Back to top\\n   153→\\n   154→\\n   155→\\n   156→\\n   157→9.

If ServeServletsByClassnameEnabled is set to true (check the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the WEB-INF directory of your webModule) in your webModule, servlet/uri definition is not needed.\\n    57→\\n    58→ 2.

Open a browser and access your Web module from the browser, then navigate the application in the browser to populate the session.\\n    61→\\n    62→ 4. Press Crtl+N to open a new browser, then access the SessionInspectServlet in the new browser by calling the URI that you defined in step 2. If you are using ServeServletsbyClassname, the URI will be \"webapp_context_root\\\\servlet\\\\com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet\". This displays the session details at that moment. You can access the servlet as you navigate your application to determine the session contents as you go along. Note: The servlet does not support attributes in the session that are outside the WebSphere Application Server scope.

MQ/JMS Import sends the MQ/JMS Request message and in the same transaction it also puts a correlation message to a Service Integration Bus (SIBus) Queue.\\n   126→\\n   127→\\n   128→ 2. MQ/JMS Import response listener receives the MQ/JMS response message off the response queue and, at this point, it attempts to get the correlation message off the SIBus queue.\\n   129→\\n   130→\\n   131→ 3. The response listener waits for a maximum of 6 seconds for the correlation message to become available before throwing the exception that you see.\\n   132→\\n   133→\\n   134→ 4. The MQ/JMS response message is then subject to the MQ retry and backout configuration as you have defined.\\n   135→\\n   136→Therefore, a possible cause for this error is a delay in the SIBus message being committed and becoming available. This scenario might be caused by performance issues of the underlying database used by SIBus.\\n   137→\\n   138→To handle such situations you have the following options:\\n   139→ 1. For the MQ/JMS Import, JMS callback destination has the default of persistence (Application). The MQ/JMS Import sends the correlation message as PERSISTENT; therefore, the message is persistent.\\n   140→\\n   141→\\n   142→    MQ/JMS Callback Connection Factory uses the default Quality of Service for persistent, so it maps persistent to \"Reliable Persistence\" for SIBus.\\n   143→\\n   144→\\n   145→    You can try changing this to \"Assured Persistent,\" which drives the persistence of the message on the same thread as the commit call.\\n   146→\\n   147→\\n   148→ 2. Increase the retry values on the WebSphere MQ backout threshold and listener port to optimum values. In this case, the message is tried more than once before being sent to the backout queue.\\n   149→\\n   150→\\n   151→ 3. Tune the database used by SIBus to avoid any performance issue.\\n   152→    Back to top\\n   153→\\n   154→\\n   155→\\n   156→\\n   157→9.

This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel.\\n    17→The default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is\\n    18→negotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\\n    19→\\n    20→There are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object:\\n    21→\\n    22→Case #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\\n    23→\\n    24→· Administrator stop-quiesce\\n    25→· Heartbeating\\n    26→· Read ahead\\n    27→· Client asynchronous consume\\n    28→\\n    29→Set a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\n    30→\\n    31→Case #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.\\n    32→\\n    33→Set a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \"on\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\n    34→\\n    35→The Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when \"Sharing Conversations\" is configured with value of \"1\" and then <RETURN> key is entered.

[http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm].\\n    44→\\n    45→Since DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\\n    46→\\n    47→When using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server\\'s allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\\n    48→\\n    49→For DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0.

The properties in this sample are only examples, the settings in this file are dependent on the specific LDAP setup in your environment.\\n    26→\\n    27→1) Contact LDAP administrator to determine LDAP Server settings for APMUI users. Validate what filters must be used, as well as values for the bindDN and bindPassword etc, based on how the LDAP Directory Information Tree (DIT) is configured.\\n    28→\\n    29→The meaning of various properties in the ldapRegistry.xml are as follows:\\n    30→\\n    31→baseDN: specifies the starting point in the LDAP (DIT) for all LDAP searches\\n    32→bindDN: specifies the distinguished name for the application server to use when it attempts to bind to the LDAP server\\n    33→bindPwd: specifies the password for the application server to user when binding to LDAP\\n    34→\\n    35→The filters:\\n    36→\\n    37→userFilter: defines the filter is used to search LDAP for users\\n    38→groupFilter: defines the filter used to search LDAP for groups\\n    39→userIdMap: specifies the LDAP filter that maps the short name of a user to an LDAP entry\\n    40→groupIdMap: specifies the LDAP filter that maps the short name of a group to an LDAP entry\\n    41→groupMemberIdMap: specifies the LDAP filter that identifies user-to-group relationships. It specifies which property of an objectclass stores the list of members belonging to the group represented by the objectclass.\\n    42→\\n    43→The filters do not need to be specified. If they are not specified they contain default values depending on the LDAP server type (IBM Directory Server, Microsoft Active Directory etc). So these are always required, but if the default values match with the LDAP tree\\'s configuration, then they do no need to be explicitly specified in the server.xml file.\\n    44→\\n    45→For Active Directory, if no filters are specified, the default values for the filters are as follows:\\n    46→\\n    47→// Active Directory LDAP\\n    48→\\n    49→filters.put(LdapConfig.USER_FILTER, \"(&(sAMAccountName=%v)(objectcategory=user))\");\\n    50→filters.put(LdapConfig.GROUP_FILTER, \"(&(cn=%v)(objectcategory=group))\");\\n    51→filters.put(LdapConfig.USER_ID_MAP, \"user:sAMAccountName\");\\n    52→filters.put(LdapConfig.GROUP_ID_MAP, \"*:cn\");\\n    53→filters.put(LdapConfig.GROUP_MEMBER_ID_MAP, \"memberof:member\");\\n    54→\\n    55→Again, these should match with how the LDAP server is actually set up in terms of objectclasses, and attributes on the LDAP entries.

This feature can be configured in DataPower as it uses client connection with queue manager SVRCONN channel.\\n    17→The default setting of sharing conversations (SHARECNV) value is zero in DataPower mq-qm object. The same default value for MQ SVRCONN channel is 10. The sharing conversations value is\\n    18→negotiated between MQ server and DataPower and the lower value takes effect. However, in current versions of the DataPower firmware, the sharing conversations setting of 1 is treated as 0 when negotiating with MQ server.\\n    19→\\n    20→There are three use cases to configure Sharing Conversations in DataPower mq-qm object:\\n    21→\\n    22→Case #1 : The negotiated sharing conversations value is 0 - The channel runs in a mode similar to WebSphere MQ V6 and does not uses features such as\\n    23→\\n    24→· Administrator stop-quiesce\\n    25→· Heartbeating\\n    26→· Read ahead\\n    27→· Client asynchronous consume\\n    28→\\n    29→Set a value of 0 or 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower to disable sharing conversations regardless of the IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\n    30→\\n    31→Case #2: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 1 - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ V7 and later release features as outlined in case #1, but each TCP/IP channel instance has a single conversation.\\n    32→\\n    33→Set a value of 1 on the Sharing Conversations attribute and select \"on\" in Share Single Conversation attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower as shown in the following picture and a value of 1 on IBM WebSphere MQ SVRCONN setting.\\n    34→\\n    35→The Share Single Conversation attribute is only visible when \"Sharing Conversations\" is configured with value of \"1\" and then <RETURN> key is entered. For values greater than 1, the \"Share Single Conversation\" attribute is hidden in the mq-qm object.\\n    36→[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21647231&aid=1]\\n    37→\\n    38→Case #3: The negotiated sharing conversations value is 2 or more - The channel supports IBM WebSphere MQ 7 and later release features and each TCP/IP channel instance supports 2 or more conversations.\\n    39→\\n    40→Set a value of 2 or more on the Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object in DataPower and on the MQ SVRCONN channel.\\n    41→\\n    42→On average, processing of messages from client applications is 15 percent slower when using SHARECNV(10) as compared to SHARECNV(0).

[http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.0.1/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/mi12240_.htm].\\n    44→\\n    45→Since DataPower uses a connection pool in processing MQ messages, there are no additional benefits of using sharing conversations with the mq-qm object. However, in situations when mixed message sizes are used by the same mq-qm object, using case #2 will benefit mq-qm object as it will use new buffer management feature of IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 when making MQGET API call.\\n    46→\\n    47→When using a negotiated shared conversations value of 0 as in case #1, mq-qm object uses maximum message size as the buffer pool for the MQGET API call. However, when mixed message sizes are processed by the same MQ Front Side Handler (FSH), it requests buffer pool based on maximum message size configured in the mq-qm object. The use of fixed buffer pool for small and large messages can deplete MQ server\\'s allocated buffer and contribute to unexpected termination of MQ SVRCONN channel instance and may terminate the queue manager. In such a situation, using a negotiated sharing conversations value of 1 as in case #2 will benefit DataPower mq-qm object as it will use IBM WebSphere MQ Version 7 Read Ahead feature and the new buffer management feature for MQGET API call. IBM WebSphere MQ V8 release provides enhanced performance for case #2, when the negotiated sharing conversations value is 1.\\n    48→\\n    49→For DataPower firmware releases 7.0.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.2.0.x and earlier, one should follow case #1 and use a negotiated sharing conversations value of 0. If you configure these firmware versions with case #2 or case #3, DataPower device may reload or hang due to connection instability and generate many MQ errors with Reason Code - 2009 and 2059.\\n    50→\\n    51→Cases #2 and #3 can be used in firmware releases 7.5.0.x, 7.5.1.x and later. We suggest to use a value of 10 or less in Sharing Conversations attribute of the mq-qm object and verify the configuration empirically to make sure that IBM WebSphere MQ server can sustain load from DataPower with the negotiated Sharing Conversations of 10.\\n    52→\\n    53→Note: In order to use sharing conversations, make sure you have applied APAR IV24821 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV24821] (\"Client C application process hangs after cancelling thread\") to the IBM WebSphere MQ server.

The \"default route\" is created by setting the Default Gateway of an interface on a DataPower appliance.\\n    17→\\n    18→A default route will be used if a known route does not exist for a given destination address. If multiple default routes are configured, the appliance will randomly pick which interface to use for outbound traffic if a more specific route cannot be found.\\n    19→\\n    20→If you want your network traffic to follow a specific route, set a static route and NOT rely on the default gateway. As a general rule, the management interface should not have the default gateway set, as you generally want to restrict the connections that can be made through that interface.\\n    21→\\n    22→A general recommendation is to set specific static routes and only ONE default gateway that will catch all traffic not being directed by the static routes.\\n    23→\\n    24→Consider the following example after running this command from the CLI:\\n    25→\\n    26→xs40# show route\\n    27→\\n    28→destination interface gateway metric 0.0.0.0/0 eth0 167.91.8.1 0 0.0.0.0/0 eth1 167.91.7.1 0 0.0.0.0/0 mgt0 10.238.77.1 0 10.238.77.0/24 mgt0 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21249208&amp;aid=1] 0 167.81.18.0/23 eth0 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21249208&amp;aid=1] 0 167.81.18.0/23 eth1 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21249208&amp;aid=1] 0\\n    29→\\n    30→The output above shows that three default gateways were configured on eth0, eth1, and mgt0 which causes three \"default\" route to be generated (0.0.0.0/0). If the destination address of your service is 166.84.23.4, the device will randomly choose any one of the default routes as no specific route is configured. If, for example, the gateway picked is 10.238.77.1 and the gateway does not know how to route to the needed backend server ip address, this will cause unexpected connection failures. In the case of such failure, a reboot of the device will lead to a different route to be randomly picked, thus temporarily resolving until the next failure.\\n    31→\\n    32→Firmware 3.7.2 and later\\n    33→\\n    34→Instructions for setting the default gateway and for setting a static route can be found in the \"Managing the appliance\" section of the Administrators Guide.

Can it be directed to a shared (NFS) space? 17:40 What is the difference between WAS installation through IM and Silent mode installation? 19:21 How to import license from RAD 7.0 to 8.5.5 (trial version)? 19:51 Can you please give an overview of using IM to install ifix? 20:38 I have WAS ND 8.5.5 32-bit installed on a 32-bit linux server, and I have a new linux 64bit server that we want only the 64bit 8.5.5 WAS, and use the DMGR on the 32-bit server, how do we do this? 22:14 Why is IBM only providing Installation of WebSphere Application Server through Installation Mananger? 23:01 When we go for Ifix and when we go for fixpack, what is basic difference between those? 23:50 Can you pleasee give information about what is the use of Liberty profile and its advantages? 24:57 What do you recommend if there is a need to duplicate the WebSphere environment? 26:54 What are the basic pre-req checks for installation of Installation Manager? 28:19 Do you have a link for how to federate the 64-bit WAS ND APPSERVER to 32-bit DMGR, instructions/step (jython scripting) so it can be automated? 29:20 With WebSphere products changing the method of installation, is there a white paper, or recommended practices, for setting up a central repository? 30:33 Is there any way make a WAS back-up through Installation Manager? 30:52 Do we have to uninstall previous ifix before installing latest fix pack? 32:09 We are planning to migrate from WAS 6.1 to WAS8.5.5, can I install 8.5.5 on top of the existing 6.1 profile? Or does it have to be a fresh installation? 33:10 I have an NFS share on 3 servers and IIM is installed there. Can I utilize IIM to install/uninstall with 2 different users without any issues on all 3 servers? 34:44 Is there a document for migrating WebSphere 7 to WAS 8.7 entire cell, say node-by-node? 35:11 What provisions does WebSphere Application Server provide to prevent denial of service attacks? 35:40 If we have 32-bit 8.5.5 DMGR and 1 APPSRVR 32-bit 8.5.5 and a 2nd APPSRVR 64-bit 8.5.5, does the DMGR have to be updated first or can we update the APPServers first? That is, does the order matter for fixes? 36:58 Is it a good idea to create any dependency on the dmgr for runtime? For example, Adobe Life Cycle installed on top of WAS uses some cache mechanism called gds, gemfire, etc. 37:42 I noticed on IM with 8.5 that when you choose to install the updates, it always goes through your IBM PA account to get the updates and the latest. But with Maximo application for instance, you only want to go to 8.5.0.1 for instance, so the only way I found is run the update pointing to the repository for fix 1, and choose update and keep clicking cancel to look online to continue and install the fix 1. Is this the only way to install a fix on V8 or V8.5? 39:40 When migrating WAS from 6.1 to 8.5, do you guys recommend using the migration tool or create configurations using scripts? 40:44 To upgrade websphere from 6.1 to 8.5, What path do you suggest: fresh install or migration proces?. If you suggest migration process where can I get the documentation? 42:34 To get to WAS 8.0 from WAS 8.1, is this a migration process only? 42:57 What is the latest fix pack available on top of 8.5.5.0 base (and location to down load from Passport Advantage)? 43:37 Is there a fixed release scheduled for FixPacks? I hear that it\\'s every 3 months or so. 44:24 If I have 1000 servers to apply FP, whats the recommended method to apply fixes to large number of servers in minimum time; any tools available? 47:01 I have IIM, WASND, WAS installed and configured per application\\'s requirement. Now, I want to install another instance of WAS. Does IIM have an option to take the existing WAS as a template so that I can get the configuration also? 47:49 We are planning to upgrade from 6.1 to 8.5.5.0. What\\'s the stable version (already being used by companies)? 48:45 Closing remarks 50:05 End of Call\\n    30→Panel of Experts: Jeanette Daly WebSphere Application Server L2 Support Mike Hill WebSphere Application Server L2 Support Vishavpal Shergill WebSphere Application Server L2 Support Vikram Thommandru WebSphere Application Server L2 Support\\n    31→\\n    32→PRESENTATION\\n    33→[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/weblecture.gif]WSTE-12122013-AskTheExperts-WebSphere_Application_Server_installation_update_uninstall.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27040108&aid=2]WSTE-12122013-AskTheExperts-WebSphere_Application_Server_installation_update_uninstall.pdf [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27040108&aid=1]\\n    34→\\n    35→Get Adobe Reader [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html] to view PDF\\n    36→\\n    37→AUDIO\\n    38→[http://www.ibm.com/i/v16/icons/aud.gif]To replay the recording of this conference call, click on Download Audio [http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/techexchange/December-12-2013-Daly-Hill-Shergill-Thommandru.mp3](audio in MP3 format).

Prior to use of IM, the fixpacks for IHS (V7 and V6.x) did not include files expected to be customized such as default static content files like index.html and other HTML, GIF, and ICO files installed by IHS to its <IBM HTTP Server home>/htdocs directory. More importantly the admin.passwd file (that holds the user/passsword for the IHS Admin Service) is usually configured right after install when using the Plugin Configration Tool (PCT).\\n    14→\\n    15→Prior to use of IM you could not install directly to a fixpack level. You had to install the base GA code (i.e. 7.0.0.0 or 6.1.0.0) and then use the Update Installer to apply fixpacks.

A system dump shows an abend 0C1 occurring in the Debug Tool for z/OS module EQA10OSM. \nI receive the following messages:\nDFHAP1203I Language Environment is being initialized. \nDFHSR0601 Program interrupt occurred with system task III in control.

The third document (907e9a49.md) describes exactly the problem you're experiencing.\n\n---\n\n## Answer\n\nYour CICS region is failing during startup due to **a mismatch in z/OS levels between Language Environment modules** (CEECCICS and CEEPLPKA).\n\n### Root Cause\nWhen you upgraded to CICS TS V5.2, there is an inconsistency between the z/OS Language Environment modules in your library concatenations. The modules CEECCICS and CEEPLPKA are at different z/OS levels, causing the 0C1 abend during Language Environment initialization.\n\n### Resolution\n**Ensure that there is only one instance of CEEPLPKA and CEECCICS in your library concatenations, and that they are at the correct z/OS level.**\n\nSpecifically:\n1. Check your STEPLIB and other library concatenations for duplicate copies of these modules\n2. Verify that both CEEPLPKA and CEECCICS are from the same z/OS release\n3. Remove any older versions that may be causing the mismatch\n\n### Why This Happens\nThe messages you're seeing indicate:\n- `DFHAP1203I` - Language Environment initialization is starting\n- `DFHSR0601` - A program interrupt (0C1 abend) occurs in system task III during this initialization\n- The 0C1 abend in EQA10OSM (Debug Tool module) is a symptom of the underlying Language Environment

Workplace XT attempts to resolve user names and groups defined within the Access Roles based on the Directory Service configuration. If the user name query resolves to null or contains an invalid entry, a NullPointerException occurs.\n\n**Resolution:**\nIn FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM), change the User Display Name Attribute or Group Display Name Attribute to a valid LDAP entry such as:\n- `cn`\n- `displayName` \n- `uid`\n\nAfter making this change, restart the FileNet Content Engine and Workplace XT instances.\n\n[来源:

documentation (but focused on security vulnerabilities and other issues)\n- WebSphere Application Server port configuration guidance (but not specific to WTX Launcher)\n\n⚠️ The documents mention WTX

6,002\" when you have the port range set to 7000/8000.\n\n**Possible reasons this might be happening** (based on general knowledge, not from the knowledge base):\n- The system may be trying to use a hardcoded or previously configured port (6002) that conflicts with your port range setting (7000-8000)\n- There may be a configuration file or registry setting that needs to be updated to reflect the new port range\n- Version 9.0 may have different port configuration requirements compared to 8.4\n\nFor detailed troubleshooting of this specific WTX Launcher 9.0 port configuration issue, I recommend

MQ/JMS Import sends the MQ/JMS Request message and in the same transaction it also puts a correlation message to a Service Integration Bus (SIBus) Queue.\\n   126→\\n   127→\\n   128→ 2.

The response listener waits for a maximum of 6 seconds for the correlation message to become available before throwing the exception that you see.\\n   132→\\n   133→\\n   134→ 4. The MQ/JMS response message is then subject to the MQ retry and backout configuration as you have defined.\\n   135→\\n   136→Therefore, a possible cause for this error is a delay in the SIBus message being committed and becoming available. This scenario might be caused by performance issues of the underlying database used by SIBus.\\n   137→\\n   138→To handle such situations you have the following options:\\n   139→ 1. For the MQ/JMS Import, JMS callback destination has the default of persistence (Application). The MQ/JMS Import sends the correlation message as PERSISTENT; therefore, the message is persistent.\\n   140→\\n   141→\\n   142→    MQ/JMS Callback Connection Factory uses the default Quality of Service for persistent, so it maps persistent to \"Reliable Persistence\" for SIBus.\\n   143→\\n   144→\\n   145→    You can try changing this to \"Assured Persistent,\" which drives the persistence of the message on the same thread as the commit call.\\n   146→\\n   147→\\n   148→ 2. Increase the retry values on the WebSphere MQ backout threshold and listener port to optimum values. In this case, the message is tried more than once before being sent to the backout queue.\\n   149→\\n   150→\\n   151→ 3. Tune the database used by SIBus to avoid any performance issue.\\n   152→    Back to top\\n   153→\\n   154→\\n   155→\\n   156→\\n   157→9.

", "status": "passed", "elapsed_seconds": 87.6748993396759, "cost_usd": 0.1669981, "num_turns": 8, "answer_length": 1594, "answer": "**Yes, transient user support is available for SAML integration with WebSphere Portal 8.0.**\n\nAccording to the documentation, there are two options for handling SAML authentication without maintaining local accounts:\n\n**Option 1: Use idAssertion (Not Supported by Default)**\nThe `sso_<n>.sp.idMap = idAssertion` parameter means no entry is necessary for the user in the user registry, but this is **not supported in WebSphere Portal by default**. If you use this setting, you'll encounter errors like `CWWIM1011E InvalidUniqueNameException` because Portal expects a fully distinguished name.\n\n**Option 2: Enable Transient User Support (Recommended)**\nTransient user support for SAML TAI was introduced starting with **Cumulative Fix (CF) #8 for WebSphere Portal 8.5**. This feature allows you to leverage the SAML TAI provided by WebSphere Application Server without maintaining local accounts in your Portal user registry for every external user verified by your identity provider.\n\n⚠️ **Important**: The documentation indicates transient user support is available for Portal 8.5 CF#8 and later, not Portal 8.0. For Portal 8.0, you would need to use the standard approach with `sso_<n>.sp.idMap = localRealm`, which requires user entries in the local registry.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- WebSphere Portal also provides transient user support when configured with OpenID authentication\n- For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the WebSphere Portal Security blog for business case and

I found highly relevant documentation about the `WTRN0047E: java.io.NotSerializableException` error in WebSphere Application Server. Let me provide you with the answer based on these documents.\n\n---\n\n## Answer: Java.io.NotSerializableException with WTRN0047E in WebSphere\n\nYes, this is a known issue in WebSphere Application Server. Here's what the documentation shows:\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe `WTRN0047E: java.io.NotSerializableException` error occurs when:\n\n1. **Persistent sessions or PMI (Performance Monitoring Infrastructure) is enabled**\n2. **An object in the HTTPSession does not implement `java.io.Serializable` or `java.io.Externalizable` interface**\n\nThe class name at the end of the exception indicates which object failed to serialize. This object is typically either:\n- An attribute placed directly into the session object, OR\n- An object referenced by a session attribute\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/2a8bfc72.md > CAUSE]\n\n### Resolution\n\n**Implement the Serializable interface:**\n\n```java\npublic class MyObject implements Serializable {\n}\n```\n\nWith persistent sessions enabled, any object put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface for session manager to store session data outside of JVM.\n\nWhen PMI is enabled, session data must be serialized into a byte array stream to evaluate the session data size counter.\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/2a8bfc72.md > RESOLVING THE PROBLEM]\n\n### Diagnostic Tool: SessionInspectServlet\n\nTo identify which attribute references the non-serializable object, use the **SessionInspectServlet**:\n\n**How to access:**\n1. The servlet class `com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet` is already shipped with WebSphere and in the classpath\n2. Define a servlet/uri entry, or enable `ServeServletsByClassnameEnabled=true` in `ibm-web-ext.xmi`\n3. Restart your web module\n4. Navigate your application to populate the session\n5. Access the servlet via: `webapp_context_root/servlet/com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet`\n\n**This servlet helps you:**\n- Determine attributes present in the session\n- Identify serializable vs non-serializable attributes\n- Check the size of each serializable attribute\n- Verify if serializable attributes are properly implemented\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/2a8bfc72.md > RESOLVING THE PROBLEM]\n\n### Related Issues\n\nThe knowledge base also documents similar NotSerializableException issues in:\n- **WebSphere Compute Grid V8.0**

Press Crtl+N to open a new browser, then access the SessionInspectServlet in the new browser by calling the URI that you defined in step 2. If you are using ServeServletsbyClassname, the URI will be \"webapp_context_root\\\\servlet\\\\com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet\". This displays the session details at that moment. You can access the servlet as you navigate your application to determine the session contents as you go along. Note: The servlet does not support attributes in the session that are outside the WebSphere Application Server scope.

However, there are important limitations:\n\n1. **IBM has not tested or sought certification with Citrix** - IBM does not provide official support for Citrix deployments.\n\n2. **Support limitations** - If you deploy Datacap clients on Citrix and encounter issues, IBM may require you to reproduce the issues outside of Citrix as part of the investigation.\n\n3. **Recommended approach for remote users** - The best practices suggest that remote users accessing Datacap over a WAN should use:\n   - Taskmaster Web-based \"thin clients\" \n   - FastDoc Capture operating in offline mode\n\n4. **Performance considerations** - Datacap thick clients (DotScan, DotEdit) and utilities (NENU, Fingerprint Maintenance Tool) require LAN communication speeds and low latency for responsive performance.\n\n**Recommendation:** For optimal support and performance, consider using Taskmaster Web-based thin clients for remote access rather than running Datacap clients through Citrix.\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/732ad109.md > WAN LAN architecture deployment]\n\nFor more detailed deployment recommendations and diagrams, the documentation references the IBM Redbooks titled \"Implementing Imaging Solutions with IBM Production Imaging Edition and IBM Datacap Capture\", section 2.5.", "tools_used": ["Skill", "Read", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/732ad109.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/b60f5b8d.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/38576b8f.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/77ca490b.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/620d760b.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/732ad109.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/620d760b.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/9acd71ba.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/9acd71ba.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/f8f484d2.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/f8f484d2.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/b60f5b8d.md"], "contexts_count": 7, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["there", "Based", "about", "Support", "issue", "successfully", "found", "detailed", "important", "consider", "support", "using", "issues", "communication", "perform", "Document", "Datacap", "clients"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Skill", "Read", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/732ad109.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/b60f5b8d.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/38576b8f.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/77ca490b.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/620d760b.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/732ad109.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/620d760b.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/9acd71ba.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/9acd71ba.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/ragbench-techqa/f8f484d2.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/f8f484d2.md", "docs/ragbench-techqa/b60f5b8d.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "judge_score": 3.4, "faithfulness": 0.684, "relevancy": -1, "judge": {"faithfulness": 0.684, "answer_relevancy": -1, "relevancy": -1, "score": 3.4, "reason": "RAGAS: faith=0.68"}, "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "922b4271-4484-456b-a4d0-29eba6120f9a", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "failed"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "preprocess", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "preprocess", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "d8385c29-1032-4008-9cc5-0e4ee4a42dbd", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Datacap and Citrix compatibility.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_1kr44FpBQTtAh8D1qKGJKB', name='Skill', input={'args': '{\"query\": \"Datacap thin clients Citrix compatibility\", \"top_k\": 5}', 'skill': 'mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_1kr44FpBQTtAh8D1qKGJKB', content='<tool_use_error>Unknown skill: mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search</tool_use_error>', is_error=True)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Let me search using the correct approach -

(MPGW)**: ✅ **Supports** HTTP CONNECT method for SSL tunneling\n- When configured with a User Agent's HTTP Proxy Policy, the Multi-Protocol Gateway can use the CONNECT method for SSL proxy requests\n- This allows SSL requests to be tunneled from the client to the backend server through a remote proxy\n\n**XML Firewall (XMLFW)**: ❌ **Does NOT support** HTTP CONNECT method for SSL tunneling\n- The XML Firewall service is not designed to use the CONNECT method for SSL tunneling\n- XML Firewall can handle non-SSL proxy requests using HTTP Options tab configuration (Proxy Host and Port), but not SSL tunneling via CONNECT\n\n## Configuration\n\nFor SSL proxy requests using CONNECT method:\n- Use a **Multi-Protocol Gateway** service\n- Configure an **HTTP Proxy Policy** in the **User Agent**\n- The proxy server will receive CONNECT requests and tunnel the SSL traffic between client and backend server\n\nFor non-SSL proxy requests:\n- Both XML Firewall and Multi-Protocol Gateway can be used\n- XML Firewall: Configure in HTTP Options tab (Proxy Host and Port)\n- Multi-Protocol Gateway: Configure HTTP Proxy Policy in User Agent\n\n[Source: docs/ragbench-techqa/6b083006.md > Forward

This will ensure we have the correct IP address for the workstation. If none of this works, you will need to do a TSO PING of the host name of the workstation from a TSO session on the MVS® system running IODM\\'s CICS region.
