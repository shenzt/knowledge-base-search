For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted.

For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.496,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"40893428\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"40893428-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.4-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisstack 7.4 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Community Edition 7.4.0-v0 (July 2024) > Headlines\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Data Structures**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Hash`: Redis now supports expiration of individual hash fields. Redis already supports key expiration. For each key, users can specify a time when it should expire, or specify the remaining time-to-live (TTL) after which it would expire. One very frequent request was to allow specifying expiration time or TTL also for individual hash fields, which is now supported using nine new Redis commands:\\\\\\\\n- `HEXPIRE`, `HPEXPIRE`, `HEXPIREAT`, `HPEXPIREAT` - set the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields. \\\\\\\\n- `HTTL`, `HPTTL`, `HEXPIRETIME`, `HPEXPIRETIME` - retrieve the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields\\\\\\\\n- `HPERSIST` - remove the expiration of specific hash fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Streams`: It is now possible to start reading from the last stream message using `XREAD` with the new id value `+`.\\\\\\\\nThere are many additional improvements, including new command arguments, security, performance, and resource utilization enhancements, several new metrics and configuration parameters were introduced, and multiple bugs were fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Time series`: The latest time series data structure adds a highly requested feature: insertion-filter for close samples. Many sensors report data periodically. Often, the difference between the measured value and the previously measured value is negligible and related to random noise or to measurement accuracy limitations. When both the time difference and the value difference between the current and the previous sample are small, it may be preferable to ignore (not to add) the new measurement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`JSON`: Introduces a fix to avoid duplicating AOF commands multiple times in `JSON.MSET`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Probabilistic`: Now, an error is returned if `CMS.MERGE` results in an overflow or underflow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and query**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- New `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` vector data types reduce memory consumed by vectors while preserving accuracy.\\\\\\\\n- Support for indexing empty and missing values and enhanced developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities.\\\\\\\\n- Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax simpler.\\\\\\\\n- Geospatial search capabilities have been expanded with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, and ergonomics have been improved by providing better reporting of the memory consumed by the index and exposing the Full-text scoring in the aggregation pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf one or more fields of a hash key expire after a query begins (using FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE), Redis does not account for these lazily expired fields.

Let me provide you with a detailed answer.\n\n## Redis Streams for Message Queuing\n\nRedis Streams is a powerful data structure designed for message queuing and event streaming. Here's how to use it:\n\n### Basic Message Production\n\nUse `XADD` to add messages to a stream:\n\n```bash\nXADD mystream * field1 value1 field2 value2\n```\n\nThe `*` tells Redis to auto-generate a unique message ID based on timestamp.\n\n### Reading Messages\n\n**Simple reading with XREAD:**\n```bash\nXREAD COUNT 10 STREAMS mystream 0-0\n```\n\nThis reads up to 10 messages from the beginning of the stream.\n\n**Blocking reads for real-time processing:**\n```bash\nXREAD BLOCK 5000 STREAMS mystream $\n```\n\nThis blocks for up to 5 seconds waiting for new messages (the `$` means \"only new messages\").\n\n### Consumer Groups (Recommended for Message Queuing)\n\nFor reliable message queuing with multiple consumers, use consumer groups:\n\n**1. Create a consumer group:**\n```bash\nXGROUP CREATE mystream mygroup 0-0\n```\n\n**2. Read messages as a consumer:**\n```bash\nXREADGROUP GROUP mygroup consumer1 COUNT 1 STREAMS mystream >\n```\n\nThe `>` symbol means \"give me new messages not yet delivered to any consumer in this group.\"\n\n**3. Acknowledge processed messages:**\n```bash\nXACK mystream mygroup message-id\n```\n\n### Idempotent Message Processing (Redis 8.6+)\n\nTo prevent duplicate messages when producers retry, use idempotent production:\n\n```bash\n# Manual ID mode\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value\n\n# Automatic mode (Redis generates ID from content)\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value\n```\n\nThis ensures at-most-once production even if the producer crashes or network issues cause retries.\n\n### Key Features for Message Queuing\n\n- **Message Queuing**: Ensures smooth communication between components\n- **Consumer Groups**: Multiple consumers can process messages in parallel\n- **Acknowledgment**: Track which messages have been processed\n- **Persistence**: Messages are stored on disk (if Redis persistence is enabled)\n- **Scalability**: Handles high-traffic usage efficiently\n\n### Use Cases\n\nRedis Streams is particularly effective for:\n- Machine learning frameworks requiring reliable message passing\n- Chatbot platforms needing session management and caching\n- GenAI applications requiring streaming LLM output\n- Real-time data processing pipelines\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/streams/idempotency.md > Idempotency modes]  \n[来源:

This feature enables reliable message submission with automatic deduplication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdempotent message processing ensures that handling the same message multiple times produces the same system state as handling it once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeginning with Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when producers resend messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProducers may need to resend messages under two scenarios:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producer-Redis network issues (disconnection and reconnection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If a disconnection occurs after the producer executes `XADD`, but before it receives the reply, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The producer crashes and restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If the producer crashes after calling `XADD` but before receiving the reply and marking a message as delivered, after a restart, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases, to guarantee that the message is added to the stream, the producer must call `XADD` again with the same message. Without idempotent message processing, a retry may result in a message being delivered twice. With idempotent message processing, producers can guarantee at-most-once production even under such scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA unique ID, called an idempotent ID or *iid*, is associated with each message that is added to a stream. \\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to assign iids:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producers provide a unique iid for each message. An iid can be some identifier already associated with this message: a transaction ID, a counter, or a UUID.\\\\\\\\n1. Redis generates an iid based on each message’s content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the same message is added to the stream more than once, the same iid would need to be provided by the producer.\\\\\\\\nFor (1), this is the producer’s responsibility, and for (2), Redis will calculate the same iid, as long as the message content hasn’t changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the [`XADD`]() command with idempotency parameters, `IDMP` or `IDMPAUTO`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # producer-1 (pid) and iid-1 (iid) are provided manually\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value        # producer-2 (pid) is provided manually, Redis provides the iid\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.7362,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/streams/idempotency.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotent message processing\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotency modes > Automatic mode (`IDMPAUTO`)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Specify both producer ID (pid) and iid explicitly:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer1 msg1 * field value\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `pid`: Unique identifier for the message producer.\\\\\\\\n- `iid`: Unique identifier for a specific message.\\\\\\\\n- Performance: Faster processing (no hash calculation).\\\\\\\\n- Control: Full control over ID generation and uniqueness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecify only the pid; Redis generates the iid from message content:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer1 * field value\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `pid`: Unique identifier for the message producer.\\\\\\\\n- Automatic deduplication: Redis calculates an iid from field-value pairs.\\\\\\\\n- Content-based: The same content produces the same iid.\\\\\\\\n- Performance: Slightly slower due to hash calculation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor both IDMP and IDMPAUTO, each producer application is required to use the same pid after it restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor IDMP, each producer application is responsible for:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Providing a unique iid for each entry (either globally, or just for each pid).\\\\\\\\n- Reusing the same (pid, iid) when resending a message (even after it restarts).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an illustration of how message processing in Redis Streams works with and without idempotent production:\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6731,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"It\\'s not just a matter of RTT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Request/Response server can be implemented so that it is able to process new requests even if the client hasn\\'t already read the old responses.\\\\\\\\nThis way it is possible to send *multiple commands* to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use for many decades.\\\\\\\\nFor instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has supported pipelining since its early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.\\\\\\\\nThis is an example using the raw netcat utility:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash \\\\\\\\n$ (printf \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; sleep 1) | nc localhost 6379\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time we don\\'t pay the cost of RTT for every call, but just once for the three commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be explicit, with pipelining the order of operations of our very first example will be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the client sends commands using pipelining, the server will be forced to queue the replies, using memory. So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.3472,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5a96aeb4\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

时指定误判率：\n\n```redis\nBF.RESERVE {key} {error_rate} {capacity} [EXPANSION expansion] [NONSCALING]\n```\n\n**参数说明：**\n- `error_rate`：误判率，取值范围 `(0, 1)`，例如：\n  - `0.001` = 0.1% 误判率（千分之一）\n  - `0.01` = 1% 误判率（百分之一）\n  - `0.0001` = 0.01% 误判率（万分之一）\n\n**示例：**\n```redis\nBF.RESERVE bikes:models 0.001 1000000\n```\n创建一个容量 100 万、误判率 0.1% 的 Bloom Filter。\n\n## 2. 全局默认配置\n\n在 `redis.conf` 中设置默认误判率（Redis 8.0+）：\n\n```conf\nbf-error-rate 0.01\n```\n\n- **类型**：double\n- **有效范围**：`(0, 1)`（大于 0.25 的值会被视为 0.25）\n- **默认值**：`0.01`（1%）\n- **支持运行时修改**：是（通过 `CONFIG SET`）\n\n## 3. 误判率与内存的关系\n\n不同误判率对应的内存开销：\n\n| 误判率 | 哈希函数数量 | 每项所需位数 |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1%     | 7           | 9.585 bits  |\n| 0.1%   | 10          | 14.378 bits |\n| 0.01%  | 14          | 19.170 bits |\n\n**计算公式：**\n- 哈希函数数量 = `ceil(-ln(error_rate) / ln(2))`\n- 每项位数 = `-ln(error_rate) / ln(2)^2`\n- 总位数 = `capacity * -ln(error_rate) / ln(2)^2`\n\n## 4. 注意事项\n\n- **误判率越低，内存消耗越大**：0.01% 误判率比 1% 误判率多消耗约 2 倍内存\n- **自动扩展**：当容量不足时，会创建新的子过滤器，误判率会逐渐增加\n- **NONSCALING 标志**：如果确定不会扩展，使用此标志可减少一个哈希函数，但达到容量后误判率会上升\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter.md >

For example, for a desired false positive rate of 0.1% (1 in 1000), error_rate should be set to 0.001.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the number of items you expect having in your filter in total and is trivial when you have a static set but it becomes more challenging when your set grows over time. It\\'s important to get the number right because if you **oversize** - you\\'ll end up wasting memory. If you **undersize**, the filter will fill up and a new one will have to be stacked on top of it (sub-filter stacking). In the cases when a filter consists of multiple sub-filters stacked on top of each other latency for adds stays the same, but the latency for presence checks increases. The reason for this is the way the checks work: a regular check would first be performed on the top (latest) filter and if a negative answer is returned the next one is checked and so on. That\\'s where the added latency comes from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding an item to a Bloom filter never fails due to the data structure \\\\\\\\\\\\\"filling up\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Instead, the error rate starts to grow. To keep the error close to the one set on filter initialization, the Bloom filter will auto-scale, meaning, when capacity is reached, an additional sub-filter will be created.  \\\\\\\\n The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by `EXPANSION`. If the number of items to be stored in the filter is unknown, we recommend that you use an expansion of 2 or more to reduce the number of sub-filters. Otherwise, we recommend that you use an expansion of 1 to reduce memory consumption. The default expansion value is 2. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n The filter will keep adding more hash functions for every new sub-filter in order to keep your desired error rate. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMaybe you\\'re wondering \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why would I create a smaller filter with a high expansion rate if I know I\\'m going to scale anyway?\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; the answer is: for cases where you need to keep many filters (let\\'s say a filter per user, or per product) and most of them will stay small, but some with more activity will have to scale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you know you\\'re not going to scale use the `NONSCALING` flag because that way the filter will use one hash function less. Just remember that if you ever do reach the initially assigned capacity - your error rate will start to grow.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.6019,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Reserving Bloom filters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Consider a bike manufacturer that makes a million different kinds of bikes and you\\'d like to avoid using a duplicate model name in new models.

From the `redis-cli`, run the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> RG.PYEXECUTE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GearsBuilder().run()\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis command doesn\\'t do much; it simply iterates over the keyspace. Let\\'s add a key and run it again:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> SET message \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello world\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> RG.PYEXECUTE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GearsBuilder().run()\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'event\\': None, \\'key\\': \\'message\\', \\'type\\': \\'string\\', \\'value\\': \\'hello world\\'}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ve added a single string, and you can see that this gears function processes it, even though it does nothing with the data. Let\\'s actually do something with the data. So first, we\\'ll add a few more strings:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud::6379> SET message:2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello galaxy\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> SET message:3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello universe\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe now have three strings in our database. Suppose we want to perform a unique word count on these strings. We can write a RedisGears function to do this just that. So open a file called `wordcount.py`, and add the following code:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```py\\\\\\\\ngb = GearsBuilder()\\\\\\\\ngb.map(lambda x: x[\\'value\\'])     # map each key object to its string value\\\\\\\\ngb.flatmap(lambda x: x.split())  # split each string into a list of words\\\\\\\\ngb.countby()                     # run a count-unique on these words\\\\\\\\ngb.run()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to load files into RedisGears. For production deployments, we recommend using the special [`gears-cli`](https://github.com/gears-project/gears-cli). However, for the purpose of this demonstration, the easiest way is to pass the filename through the `redis-cli` command, like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli rg.pyexecute \\\\\\\\\\\\\"`cat wordcount.py`\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'world\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'galaxy\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'hello\\', \\'value\\': 3}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'universe\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe results here show the number of occurrences of each word in all of our strings. So, we\\'ve effectively processed the data in our Redis database all at once, in a batch.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='HyperLogLog in Redis is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the cardinality (count of unique elements) of a set using a clever space-efficient algorithm.\\n\\n## How it works\\n\\nInstead of storing actual elements (which would require memory proportional to the number of items), HyperLogLog maintains only a mathematical state that allows it to estimate uniqueness.

**Redis Lists（基于阻塞操作）**\n\n**核心特性：**\n- 使用 `LPUSH`/`RPUSH` 生产消息，`BLPOP`/`BRPOP` 消费消息\n- **阻塞式消费**：当队列为空时，消费者会阻塞等待新消息到达\n- **简单的生产者-消费者模型**：一条消息只能被一个消费者获取（消费即删除）\n\n**工作机制：**\n```redis\n# 生产者\nLPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2\n\n# 消费者（阻塞等待，超时 1 秒）\nBRPOP bikes:repairs 1\n# 返回: 1) \"bikes:repairs\" 2) \"bike:2\"\n```\n\n**特点：**\n- ✅ 实现简单，适合基础队列场景\n- ✅ 客户端按顺序服务（FIFO）\n- ✅ 可以使用 `LMOVE`/`BLMOVE` 实现更安全的队列（原子移动）\n- ❌ **无消息确认机制**：消息一旦被 POP 就从队列中删除\n- ❌ **无消费者组**：无法实现多消费者协作\n- ❌ **无消息持久化**：消费失败则消息丢失\n\n[来源: `/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md` > Blocking operations on lists]\n\n---\n\n### **Redis Streams（专为消息队列设计）**\n\n**核心特性：**\n- 使用 `XADD` 生产消息，`XREAD`/`XREADGROUP` 消费消息\n- **消费者组（Consumer Groups）**：支持多消费者协作，每条消息只被组内一个消费者处理\n- **消息持久化**：消息不会因消费而删除，可重复读取\n- **消息确认机制**：需要显式 ACK，未确认的消息会进入 Pending 列表\n\n**高级功能：**\n- 每条消息有唯一 ID（时间戳 + 序列号）\n- 支持按时间范围查询历史消息\n- 支持从最后一条消息开始读取（`XREAD` 使用 `+` ID）\n- 可以设置保留策略（按时间或数量限制）\n- 支持幂等生产（Redis 7.4+，使用 `IDMP`/`IDMPAUTO` 防止重复消息）\n\n**数据结构：**\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": [\"<ms>\", \"<seq>\"],\n  \"stream_name\": \"<stream name>\",\n  \"record\": [\n    [\"<key>\", \"<value>\"],\n    [\"<key>\", \"<value>\"]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n[来源: `/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/triggers/Stream_Triggers.md` > Register a stream consumer]\n\n---\n\n### **关键对比**\n\n| 特性 | Lists | Streams |\n|------|-------|---------|\n| **消息确认** | ❌ 无（消费即删除） | ✅ 有（XACK 确认） |\n| **消费者组** | ❌ 不支持 | ✅ 支持（XREADGROUP） |\n| **消息持久化** | ❌ 消费后丢失 | ✅ 持久化，可重复读 |\n| **故障恢复** | ❌ 消费失败则丢失 | ✅ Pending 列表追踪未确认消息 |\n| **多消费者协作** | ❌ 竞争消费 | ✅ 消费者组内负载均衡 |\n| **历史消息查询** | ❌ 不支持 | ✅ 按 ID/时间范围查询 |\n| **适用场景** | 简单队列、临时任务 | 复杂消息系统、事件溯源、日志流 |\n\n---\n\n### **选择建议**\n\n**使用 Lists 如果：**\n- 只需要简单的 FIFO 队列\n- 消息消费后不需要保留\n- 单一消费者或简单的竞争消费\n\n**使用 Streams 如果：**\n- 需要消息确认和故障恢复\n- 需要多消费者协作（消费者组）\n- 需要查询历史消息或事件溯源\n- 需要更强的可靠性保证\n\n[来源:

Redis already supports key expiration. For each key, users can specify a time when it should expire, or specify the remaining time-to-live (TTL) after which it would expire. One very frequent request was to allow specifying expiration time or TTL also for individual hash fields, which is now supported using nine new Redis commands:\\\\\\\\n- `HEXPIRE`, `HPEXPIRE`, `HEXPIREAT`, `HPEXPIREAT` - set the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields. \\\\\\\\n- `HTTL`, `HPTTL`, `HEXPIRETIME`, `HPEXPIRETIME` - retrieve the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields\\\\\\\\n- `HPERSIST` - remove the expiration of specific hash fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Streams`: It is now possible to start reading from the last stream message using `XREAD` with the new id value `+`.\\\\\\\\nThere are many additional improvements, including new command arguments, security, performance, and resource utilization enhancements, several new metrics and configuration parameters were introduced, and multiple bugs were fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Time series`: The latest time series data structure adds a highly requested feature: insertion-filter for close samples. Many sensors report data periodically. Often, the difference between the measured value and the previously measured value is negligible and related to random noise or to measurement accuracy limitations. When both the time difference and the value difference between the current and the previous sample are small, it may be preferable to ignore (not to add) the new measurement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`JSON`: Introduces a fix to avoid duplicating AOF commands multiple times in `JSON.MSET`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Probabilistic`: Now, an error is returned if `CMS.MERGE` results in an overflow or underflow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and query**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- New `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` vector data types reduce memory consumed by vectors while preserving accuracy.\\\\\\\\n- Support for indexing empty and missing values and enhanced developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities.\\\\\\\\n- Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax simpler.\\\\\\\\n- Geospatial search capabilities have been expanded with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, and ergonomics have been improved by providing better reporting of the memory consumed by the index and exposing the Full-text scoring in the aggregation pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf one or more fields of a hash key expire after a query begins (using FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE), Redis does not account for these lazily expired fields. As a result, keys with expired fields may still be included in the query results, leading to potentially incorrect or inconsistent results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Removal of triggers and functions**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Stack 7.4 will no longer include triggers and functions.

Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

feature that make them suitable to implement queues,\\\\\\\\nand in general as a building block for inter process communication systems:\\\\\\\\nblocking operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImagine you want to push items into a list with one process, and use\\\\\\\\na different process in order to actually do some kind of work with those\\\\\\\\nitems. This is the usual producer / consumer setup, and can be implemented\\\\\\\\nin the following simple way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To push items into the list, producers call [`LPUSH`]().\\\\\\\\n* To extract / process items from the list, consumers call [`RPOP`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever it is possible that sometimes the list is empty and there is nothing\\\\\\\\nto process, so [`RPOP`]() just returns NULL. In this case a consumer is forced to wait\\\\\\\\nsome time and retry again with [`RPOP`](). This is called *polling*, and is not\\\\\\\\na good idea in this context because it has several drawbacks:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Forces Redis and clients to process useless commands (all the requests when the list is empty will get no actual work done, they\\'ll just return NULL).\\\\\\\\n2. Adds a delay to the processing of items, since after a worker receives a NULL, it waits some time. To make the delay smaller, we could wait less between calls to [`RPOP`](), with the effect of amplifying problem number 1, i.e. more useless calls to Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo Redis implements commands called [`BRPOP`]() and [`BLPOP`]() which are versions\\\\\\\\nof [`RPOP`]() and [`LPOP`]() able to block if the list is empty: they\\'ll return to\\\\\\\\nthe caller only when a new element is added to the list, or when a user-specified\\\\\\\\ntimeout is reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of a [`BRPOP`]() call we could use in the worker:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> BRPOP bikes:repairs 1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> BRPOP bikes:repairs 1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> BRPOP bikes:repairs 1\\\\\\\\n(nil)\\\\\\\\n(2.01s)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt means: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"wait for elements in the list `bikes:repairs`, but return if after 1 second\\\\\\\\nno element is available\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that you can use 0 as timeout to wait for elements forever, and you can\\\\\\\\nalso specify multiple lists and not just one, in order to wait on multiple\\\\\\\\nlists at the same time, and get notified when the first list receives an\\\\\\\\nelement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA few things to note about [`BRPOP`]():\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Clients are served in an ordered way: the first client that blocked waiting for a list, is served first when an element is pushed by some other client, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n2. The return value is different compared to [`RPOP`](): it is a two-element array since it also includes the name of the key, because [`BRPOP`]() and [`BLPOP`]() are able to block waiting for elements from multiple lists.\\\\\\\\n3. If the timeout is reached, NULL is returned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are more things you should know about lists and blocking ops. We\\\\\\\\nsuggest that you read more on the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It is possible to build safer queues or rotating queues using [`LMOVE`]().\\\\\\\\n* There is also a blocking variant of the command, called [`BLMOVE`]().\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.5694,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2f31bd88\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2f31bd88-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-blocking-ops.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis modules and blocking commands\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis has a few blocking commands among the built-in set of commands.\\\\\\\\nOne of the most used is [`BLPOP`]() (or the symmetric [`BRPOP`]()) which blocks\\\\\\\\nwaiting for elements arriving in a list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe interesting fact about blocking commands is that they do not block\\\\\\\\nthe whole server, but just the client calling them. Usually the reason to\\\\\\\\nblock is that we expect some external event to happen: this can be\\\\\\\\nsome change in the Redis data structures like in the [`BLPOP`]() case, a\\\\\\\\nlong computation happening in a thread, to receive some data from the\\\\\\\\nnetwork, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis modules have the ability to implement blocking commands as well,\\\\\\\\nthis documentation shows how the API works and describes a few patterns\\\\\\\\nthat can be used in order to model blocking commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow blocking and resuming works.\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Note: You may want to check the `helloblock.c` example in the Redis source tree\\\\\\\\ninside the `src/modules` directory, for a simple to understand example\\\\\\\\non how the blocking API is applied._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis modules, commands are implemented by callback functions that\\\\\\\\nare invoked by the Redis core when the specific command is called\\\\\\\\nby the user. Normally the callback terminates its execution sending\\\\\\\\nsome reply to the client. Using the following function instead, the\\\\\\\\nfunction implementing the module command may request that the client\\\\\\\\nis put into the blocked state:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    RedisModuleBlockedClient *RedisModule_BlockClient(RedisModuleCtx *ctx, RedisModuleCmdFunc reply_callback, RedisModuleCmdFunc timeout_callback, void (*free_privdata)(void*), long long timeout_ms);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe function returns a `RedisModuleBlockedClient` object, which is later\\\\\\\\nused in order to unblock the client. The arguments have the following\\\\\\\\nmeaning:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `ctx` is the command execution context as usually in the rest of the API.\\\\\\\\n* `reply_callback` is the callback, having the same prototype of a normal command function, that is called when the client is unblocked in order to return a reply to the client.\\\\\\\\n* `timeout_callback` is the callback, having the same prototype of a normal command function that is called when the client reached the `ms` timeout.\\\\\\\\n* `free_privdata` is the callback that is called in order to free the private data. Private data is a pointer to some data that is passed between the API used to unblock the client, to the callback that will send the reply to the client. We\\'ll see how this mechanism works later in this document.\\\\\\\\n* `ms` is the timeout in milliseconds. When the timeout is reached, the timeout callback is called and the client is automatically aborted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce a client is blocked, it can be unblocked with the following API:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    int RedisModule_UnblockClient(RedisModuleBlockedClient *bc, void *privdata);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe function takes as argument the blocked client object returned by\\\\\\\\nthe previous call to `RedisModule_BlockClient()`, and unblock the client.\\\\\\\\nImmediately before the client gets unblocked, the `reply_callback` function\\\\\\\\nspecified when the client was blocked is called: this function will\\\\\\\\nhave access to the `privdata` pointer used here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIMPORTANT: The above function is thread safe, and can be called from within\\\\\\\\na thread doing some work in order to implement the command that blocked\\\\\\\\nthe client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `privdata` data will be freed automatically using the `free_privdata`\\\\\\\\ncallback when the client is unblocked. This is useful **since the reply\\\\\\\\ncallback may never be called** in case the client timeouts or disconnects\\\\\\\\nfrom the server, so it\\'s important that it\\'s up to an external function\\\\\\\\nto have the responsibility to free the data passed if needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo better understand how the API works, we can imagine writing a command\\\\\\\\nthat blocks a client for one second, and then send as reply \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello!\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: arity checks and other non important things are not implemented\\\\\\\\nint his command, in order to take the example simple.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    int Example_RedisCommand(RedisModuleCtx *ctx, RedisModuleString **argv,\\\\\\\\n                             int argc)\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n        RedisModuleBlockedClient *bc =\\\\\\\\n            RedisModule_BlockClient(ctx,reply_func,timeout_func,NULL,0);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        pthread_t tid;\\\\\\\\n        pthread_create(&tid,NULL,threadmain,bc);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        return REDISMODULE_OK;\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    void *threadmain(void *arg) {\\\\\\\\n        RedisModuleBlockedClient *bc = arg;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        sleep(1); /* Wait one second and unblock. */\\\\\\\\n        RedisModule_UnblockClient(bc,NULL);\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command blocks the client ASAP, spawning a thread that will\\\\\\\\nwait a second and will unblock the client. Let\\'s check the reply and\\\\\\\\ntimeout callbacks, which are in our case very similar, since they\\\\\\\\njust reply the client with a different reply type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    int reply_func(RedisModuleCtx *ctx, RedisModuleString **argv,\\\\\\\\n                   int argc)\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n        return RedisModule_ReplyWithSimpleString(ctx,\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello!\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    int timeout_func(RedisModuleCtx *ctx, RedisModuleString **argv,\\\\\\\\n                   int argc)\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n        return RedisModule_ReplyWithNull(ctx);\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reply callback just sends the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello!\\\\\\\\\\\\\" string to the client.\\\\\\\\nThe important bit here is that the reply callback is called when the\\\\\\\\nclient is unblocked from the thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe timeout command returns `NULL`, as it often happens with actual\\\\\\\\nRedis blocking commands timing out.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPassing reply data when unblocking\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above example is simple to understand but lacks an important\\\\\\\\nreal world aspect of an actual blocking command implementation: often\\\\\\\\nthe reply function will need to know what to reply to the client,\\\\\\\\nand this information is often provided as the client is unblocked.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe could modify the above example so that the thread generates a\\\\\\\\nrandom number after waiting one second. You can think at it as an\\\\\\\\nactually expansive operation of some kind. Then this random number\\\\\\\\ncan be passed to the reply function so that we return it to the command\\\\\\\\ncaller. In order to make this working, we modify the functions as follow:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    void *threadmain(void *arg) {\\\\\\\\n        RedisModuleBlockedClient *bc = arg;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        sleep(1); /* Wait one second and unblock. */\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        long *mynumber = RedisModule_Alloc(sizeof(long));\\\\\\\\n        *mynumber = rand();\\\\\\\\n        RedisModule_UnblockClient(bc,mynumber);\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see, now the unblocking call is passing some private data,\\\\\\\\nthat is the `mynumber` pointer, to the reply callback. In order to\\\\\\\\nobtain this private data, the reply callback will use the following\\\\\\\\nfunction:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    void *RedisModule_GetBlockedClientPrivateData(RedisModuleCtx *ctx);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo our reply callback is modified like that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    int reply_func(RedisModuleCtx *ctx, RedisModuleString **argv,\\\\\\\\n                   int argc)\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n        long *mynumber = RedisModule_GetBlockedClientPrivateData(ctx);\\\\\\\\n        /* IMPORTANT: don\\'t free mynumber here, but in the\\\\\\\\n         * free privdata callback. */\\\\\\\\n        return RedisModule_ReplyWithLongLong(ctx,mynumber);\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that we also need to pass a `free_privdata` function when blocking\\\\\\\\nthe client with `RedisModule_BlockClient()`, since the allocated\\\\\\\\nlong value must be freed. Our callback will look like the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    void free_privdata(void *privdata) {\\\\\\\\n        RedisModule_Free(privdata);\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNOTE: It is important to stress that the private data is best freed in the\\\\\\\\n`free_privdata` callback because the reply function may not be called\\\\\\\\nif the client disconnects or timeout.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that the private data is also accessible from the timeout\\\\\\\\ncallback, always using the `GetBlockedClientPrivateData()` API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAborting the blocking of a client\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne problem that sometimes arises is that we need to allocate resources\\\\\\\\nin order to implement the non blocking command. So we block the client,\\\\\\\\nthen, for example, try to create a thread, but the thread creation function\\\\\\\\nreturns an error. What to do in such a condition in order to recover? We\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t want to take the client blocked, nor we want to call `UnblockClient()`\\\\\\\\nbecause this will trigger the reply callback to be called.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this case the best thing to do is to use the following function:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    int RedisModule_AbortBlock(RedisModuleBlockedClient *bc);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPractically this is how to use it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    int Example_RedisCommand(RedisModuleCtx *ctx, RedisModuleString **argv,\\\\\\\\n                             int argc)\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n        RedisModuleBlockedClient *bc =\\\\\\\\n            RedisModule_BlockClient(ctx,reply_func,timeout_func,NULL,0);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        pthread_t tid;\\\\\\\\n        if (pthread_create(&tid,NULL,threadmain,bc) != 0) {\\\\\\\\n            RedisModule_AbortBlock(bc);\\\\\\\\n            RedisModule_ReplyWithError(ctx,\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sorry can\\'t create a thread\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        return REDISMODULE_OK;\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client will be unblocked but the reply callback will not be called.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementing the command, reply and timeout callback using a single function\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following functions can be used in order to implement the reply and\\\\\\\\ncallback with the same function that implements the primary command\\\\\\\\nfunction:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    int RedisModule_IsBlockedReplyRequest(RedisModuleCtx *ctx);\\\\\\\\n    int RedisModule_IsBlockedTimeoutRequest(RedisModuleCtx *ctx);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo I could rewrite the example command without using a separated\\\\\\\\nreply and timeout callback:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    int Example_RedisCommand(RedisModuleCtx *ctx, RedisModuleString **argv,\\\\\\\\n                             int argc)\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n        if (RedisModule_IsBlockedReplyRequest(ctx)) {\\\\\\\\n            long *mynumber = RedisModule_GetBlockedClientPrivateData(ctx);\\\\\\\\n            return RedisModule_ReplyWithLongLong(ctx,mynumber);\\\\\\\\n        } else if (RedisModule_IsBlockedTimeoutRequest) {\\\\\\\\n            return RedisModule_ReplyWithNull(ctx);\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        RedisModuleBlockedClient *bc =\\\\\\\\n            RedisModule_BlockClient(ctx,reply_func,timeout_func,NULL,0);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        pthread_t tid;\\\\\\\\n        if (pthread_create(&tid,NULL,threadmain,bc) != 0) {\\\\\\\\n            RedisModule_AbortBlock(bc);\\\\\\\\n            RedisModule_ReplyWithError(ctx,\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sorry can\\'t create a thread\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        return REDISMODULE_OK;\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctionally is the same but there are people that will prefer the less\\\\\\\\nverbose implementation that concentrates most of the command logic in a\\\\\\\\nsingle function.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWorking on copies of data inside a thread\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn interesting pattern in order to work with threads implementing the\\\\\\\\nslow part of a command, is to work with a copy of the data, so that\\\\\\\\nwhile some operation is performed in a key, the user continues to see\\\\\\\\nthe old version. However when the thread terminated its work, the\\\\\\\\nrepresentations are swapped and the new, processed version, is used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn example of this approach is the\\\\\\\\n[Neural Redis module](https://github.com/antirez/neural-redis)\\\\\\\\nwhere neural networks are trained in different threads while the\\\\\\\\nuser can still execute and inspect their older versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture work\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn API is work in progress right now in order to allow Redis modules APIs\\\\\\\\nto be called in a safe way from threads, so that the threaded command\\\\\\\\ncan access the data space and do incremental operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is no ETA for this feature but it may appear in the course of the\\\\\\\\nRedis 4.0 release at some point.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8103,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"01051429\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"01051429-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/Sync_Async.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sync and async\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Block Redis timeout\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis has a few commands that blocks the client and executed asynchronously when some condition holds (commands like [blpop]()). In general, such commands are not suppose to be called inside a script and calling them will result in running their none blocking logic. For example, [blpop]() will basically runs lpop and return empty result if the list it empty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisGears allows running blocking commands using `client.callAsync` API. `client.callAsync` will execute the blocking command and return a promise object which will be resolved when the command invocation finished (notice that `client.callAsync` allow calling any command and not just blocking but it will always return a promise object that will be resolve later, so **using it for regular commands is less efficient**). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=lib\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerAsyncFunction(\\'my_blpop\\', async function(client, key, expected_val) {\\\\\\\\n    var res = null\\\\\\\\n    do {\\\\\\\\n        res = await client.block((c) => {\\\\\\\\n            return c.callAsync(\\'blpop\\', key, \\'0\\');\\\\\\\\n        })\\\\\\\\n    } while (res[1] != expected_val);\\\\\\\\n    return res;\\\\\\\\n});\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following function will continue popping elements from the requested list up until it will encounter the requested value. In case the list is empty it will wait until elements will be added to the list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisGears also provided `client.callAsyncRaw` API, which is the same as `client.callAsync` but will not decode the replies as utf8.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Notice**: There is no guarantee when the promise returned from `client.callAsyn` will be resolved. So the **function writer should not make any assumption about atomicity guarantees.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBlocking Redis might fail for a few reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis reached OOM state and the `redis.functionFlags.NO_WRITES` or `redis.functionFlags.ALLOW_OOM` flags are not set (see [functions flags]() for more information)\\\\\\\\n* `redis.functionFlags.NO_WRITES` flag is not set and the Redis instance changed roles and is now a replica.\\\\\\\\n* The ACL user that invoked the function was deleted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe failure will result in an exception that the function writer can choose to handle or throw it to be caught by triggers and functions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBlocking Redis for a long time is discouraged and is considered an unsafe operation. The triggers and functions feature attempts to protect the function writer and will time out the blocking function if it continues for too long. The timeout can be set as a [module configuration]() along side the fatal failure policy that indicates how to handle the timeout. Policies can be one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Abort - Stop the function invocation even at the cost of losing the atomicity property.\\\\\\\\n* Kill - Keep the atomicity property and do not stop the function invocation. In this case there is a risk of an external process killing the Redis server, thinking that the shard is not responding.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.887,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-088\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Blocking clients from modules > `RedisModule_BlockClientOnKeys`\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"RedisModuleBlockedClient *RedisModule_BlockClientOnKeys(RedisModuleCtx *ctx,\\\\\\\\n                                                            RedisModuleCmdFunc reply_callback,\\\\\\\\n                                                            ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 6.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis call is similar to [`RedisModule_BlockClient()`](#RedisModule_BlockClient), however in this case we\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t just block the client, but also ask Redis to unblock it automatically\\\\\\\\nonce certain keys become \\\\\\\\\\\\\"ready\\\\\\\\\\\\\", that is, contain more data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this is similar to what a typical Redis command usually does,\\\\\\\\nlike BLPOP or BZPOPMAX: the client blocks if it cannot be served ASAP,\\\\\\\\nand later when the key receives new data (a list push for instance), the\\\\\\\\nclient is unblocked and served.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever in the case of this module API, when the client is unblocked?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. If you block on a key of a type that has blocking operations associated,\\\\\\\\n   like a list, a sorted set, a stream, and so forth, the client may be\\\\\\\\n   unblocked once the relevant key is targeted by an operation that normally\\\\\\\\n   unblocks the native blocking operations for that type. So if we block\\\\\\\\n   on a list key, an RPUSH command may unblock our client and so forth.\\\\\\\\n2. If you are implementing your native data type, or if you want to add new\\\\\\\\n   unblocking conditions in addition to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\", you can call the modules API\\\\\\\\n   [`RedisModule_SignalKeyAsReady()`](#RedisModule_SignalKeyAsReady).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnyway we can\\'t be sure if the client should be unblocked just because the\\\\\\\\nkey is signaled as ready: for instance a successive operation may change the\\\\\\\\nkey, or a client in queue before this one can be served, modifying the key\\\\\\\\nas well and making it empty again. So when a client is blocked with\\\\\\\\n[`RedisModule_BlockClientOnKeys()`](#RedisModule_BlockClientOnKeys) the reply callback is not called after\\\\\\\\n[`RedisModule_UnblockClient()`](#RedisModule_UnblockClient) is called, but every time a key is signaled as ready:\\\\\\\\nif the reply callback can serve the client, it returns `REDISMODULE_OK`\\\\\\\\nand the client is unblocked, otherwise it will return `REDISMODULE_ERR`\\\\\\\\nand we\\'ll try again later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reply callback can access the key that was signaled as ready by\\\\\\\\ncalling the API [`RedisModule_GetBlockedClientReadyKey()`](#RedisModule_GetBlockedClientReadyKey), that returns\\\\\\\\njust the string name of the key as a `RedisModuleString` object.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThanks to this system we can setup complex blocking scenarios, like\\\\\\\\nunblocking a client only if a list contains at least 5 items or other\\\\\\\\nmore fancy logics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that another difference with [`RedisModule_BlockClient()`](#RedisModule_BlockClient), is that here\\\\\\\\nwe pass the private data directly when blocking the client: it will\\\\\\\\nbe accessible later in the reply callback. Normally when blocking with\\\\\\\\n[`RedisModule_BlockClient()`](#RedisModule_BlockClient) the private data to reply to the client is\\\\\\\\npassed when calling [`RedisModule_UnblockClient()`](#RedisModule_UnblockClient) but here the unblocking\\\\\\\\nis performed by Redis itself, so we need to have some private data before\\\\\\\\nhand. The private data is used to store any information about the specific\\\\\\\\nunblocking operation that you are implementing. Such information will be\\\\\\\\nfreed using the `free_privdata` callback provided by the user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the reply callback will be able to access the argument vector of\\\\\\\\nthe command, so the private data is often not needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: Under normal circumstances [`RedisModule_UnblockClient`](#RedisModule_UnblockClient) should not be\\\\\\\\n      called for clients that are blocked on keys (Either the key will\\\\\\\\n      become ready or a timeout will occur). If for some reason you do want\\\\\\\\n      to call RedisModule_UnblockClient it is possible: Client will be\\\\\\\\n      handled as if it were timed-out (You must implement the timeout\\\\\\\\n      callback in that case).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<span id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"RedisModule_BlockClientOnKeysWithFlags\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></span>\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='根据检索结果，我找到了 Redis Lists 作为消息队列的阻塞操作文档，但关于 Streams 消费者组的详细对比信息仍然不足。让我再搜索一下 Streams 的核心特性：')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_SPBIUKi7yIZ2rSDLxT9Htm', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Streams XREAD XREADGROUP consumer acknowledgment', 'top_k': 8})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_SPBIUKi7yIZ2rSDLxT9Htm', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4911,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4103dc5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4103dc5c-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/triggers/Stream_Triggers.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Stream triggers\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Register a stream consumer\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Triggers and functions provide an API that allows to register a stream trigger. Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

You can operate on anything from unsigned 1-bit integers to signed 63-bit integers.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- Values are stored using binary-encoded Redis strings\n- Support atomic read, write, and increment operations\n- Good choice for managing counters and similar numerical values\n\n**Main commands:**\n- `BITFIELD` - atomically sets, increments, and reads one or more values\n- `BITFIELD_RO` - read-only variant of BITFIELD\n\n**When to use them:**\n\nBitfields are ideal when you need to:\n1. **Store multiple counters efficiently** - Pack multiple integer values into a single Redis key\n2. **Manage metrics with different ranges** - Each counter can have its own bit width (e.g., 32-bit for prices, 16-bit for counts)\n3. **Perform atomic updates** - Update multiple counters in a single atomic operation\n\n**Example use case:**\n\nTracking bicycle statistics (price and number of owners):\n\n```redis\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats SET u32 #0 1000\n1) (integer) 0\n\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 -50 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 950\n2) (integer) 1\n\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 500 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats GET u32 #0 GET u32 #1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n```\n\nIn this example, offset #0 stores the price (32-bit unsigned) and offset #1 stores the owner count, both packed into a single key.\n\n**Performance:** `BITFIELD` is O(n), where n is the number of counters accessed.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitfields.md > Performance]",

When we add an element to an aggregate data type, if the target key does not exist, an empty aggregate data type is created before adding the element.\\\\\\\\n2. When we remove elements from an aggregate data type, if the value remains empty, the key is automatically destroyed. The Stream data type is the only exception to this rule.\\\\\\\\n3. Calling a read-only command such as [`LLEN`]() (which returns the length of the list), or a write command removing elements, with an empty key, always produces the same result as if the key is holding an empty aggregate type of the type the command expects to find.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExamples of rule 1:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL new_bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> LPUSH new_bikes bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever we can\\'t perform operations against the wrong type if the key exists:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL new_bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SET new_bikes bike:1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> TYPE new_bikes\\\\\\\\nstring\\\\\\\\n> LPUSH new_bikes bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample of rule 2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> LPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> EXISTS bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> LPOP bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> LPOP bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> LPOP bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> EXISTS bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe key no longer exists after all the elements are popped.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample of rule 3:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> LLEN bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> LPOP bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(nil)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe maximum length of a Redis list is 2^32 - 1 (4,294,967,295) elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nList operations that access its head or tail are O(1), which means they\\'re highly efficient.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands that manipulate elements within a list are usually O(n).\\\\\\\\nExamples of these include [`LINDEX`](), [`LINSERT`](), and [`LSET`]().\\\\\\\\nExercise caution when running these commands, mainly when operating on large lists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConsider [Redis streams]() as an alternative to lists when you need to store and process an indeterminate series of events.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Redis Lists Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB5SeOkkxQc) is a short, comprehensive video explainer on Redis lists.\\\\\\\\n* [Redis University\\'s RU101](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/) covers Redis lists in detail.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.9406,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis FAQ\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Why does Redis keep its entire dataset in memory?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Redis has a different evolution path in the key-value DBs where values can contain more complex data types, with atomic operations defined on those data types. Redis data types are closely related to fundamental data structures and are exposed to the programmer as such, without additional abstraction layers.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can\\'t be larger than memory. Another advantage of\\\\\\\\nin-memory databases is that the memory representation of complex data structures\\\\\\\\nis much simpler to manipulate compared to the same data structures on disk, so\\\\\\\\nRedis can do a lot with little internal complexity. At the same time the\\\\\\\\ntwo on-disk storage formats (RDB and AOF) don\\'t need to be suitable for random\\\\\\\\naccess, so they are compact and always generated in an append-only fashion\\\\\\\\n(Even the AOF log rotation is an append-only operation, since the new version\\\\\\\\nis generated from the copy of data in memory). However this design also involves\\\\\\\\ndifferent challenges compared to traditional on-disk stores. Being the main data\\\\\\\\nrepresentation on memory, Redis operations must be carefully handled to make sure\\\\\\\\nthere is always an updated version of the data set on disk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An empty instance uses ~ 3MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 85MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 160 MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting your use case is trivial. Use the `redis-benchmark` utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the `INFO memory` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n64-bit systems will use considerably more memory than 32-bit systems to store the same keys, especially if the keys and values are small. This is because pointers take 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. But of course the advantage is that you can\\\\\\\\nhave a lot of memory in 64-bit systems, so in order to run large Redis servers a 64-bit system is more or less required. The alternative is sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past the Redis developers experimented with Virtual Memory and other systems in order to allow larger than RAM datasets, but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well: data served from memory, disk used for storage. So for now there are no plans to create an on disk backend for Redis. Most of what\\\\\\\\nRedis is, after all, a direct result of its current design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf your real problem is not the total RAM needed, but the fact that you need\\\\\\\\nto split your data set into multiple Redis instances, please read the\\\\\\\\n[partitioning page]() in this documentation for more info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Ltd., the company sponsoring Redis development, has developed a\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis on Flash\\\\\\\\\\\\\" solution that uses a mixed RAM/flash approach for\\\\\\\\nlarger data sets with a biased access pattern.

Key 级别（最高优先级）\n创建或修改时间序列时指定：\n\n```sh\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\n```\n\n```sh\nTS.ALTER temperature RETENTION 86400000\n```\n\n单位：毫秒（60000 = 60 秒）\n\n### 2. 全局默认配置（中优先级）\n\n**Redis < 8.0**（启动时加载）：\n```bash\nredis-server --loadmodule ./redistimeseries.so RETENTION_POLICY 25920000000\n```\n\n**Redis >= 8.0**（运行时配置）：\n```bash\nCONFIG SET ts-retention-policy 25920000000\nCONFIG REWRITE  # 持久化到配置文件\n```\n\n示例：25920000000 毫秒 = 300 天\n\n### 3. 无保留策略（最低优先级）\n如果未设置任何 retention，数据将无限期保留。\n\n### 配置建议\n- 对于监控场景，根据数据重要性分级设置（如原始数据 7 天，聚合数据 1 年）\n- 结合降采样（downsampling）减少长期存储成本\n- 在集群环境中，需在每个节点单独执行 `CONFIG SET`\n\n---\n\n**来源**：\n- [Redis TimeSeries Configuration

This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function. RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using Redis’ core data structures, you can only retrieve a time series by knowing the exact key holding the time series. Unfortunately, for many time series use cases (such as root cause analysis or monitoring), your application won’t know the exact key it’s looking for. These use cases typically want to query a set of time series that relate to each other in a couple of dimensions to extract the insight you need. You could create your own secondary index with core Redis data structures to help with this, but it would come with a high development cost and require you to manage edge cases to make sure the index is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries does this indexing for you based on `field value` pairs (a.k.a labels) you can add to each time series, and use to filter at query time (a full list of these filters is available in our documentation). Here’s an example of creating a time series with two labels (sensor_id and area_id are the fields with values 2 and 32 respectively) and a retention window of 60,000 milliseconds:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to query a time series, it’s cumbersome to stream all raw data points if you’re only interested in, say, an average over a given time interval.

Redis has special list commands to make this use case both more reliable and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example both the popular Ruby libraries [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) and\\\\\\\\n[sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) use Redis lists under the hood in order to\\\\\\\\nimplement background jobs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe popular Twitter social network [takes the latest tweets](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Real-Time-Delivery-Twitter)\\\\\\\\nposted by users into Redis lists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo describe a common use case step by step, imagine your home page shows the latest\\\\\\\\nphotos published in a photo sharing social network and you want to speedup access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time a user posts a new photo, we add its ID into a list with [`LPUSH`]().\\\\\\\\n* When users visit the home page, we use `LRANGE 0 9` in order to get the latest 10 posted items.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn many use cases we just want to use lists to store the *latest items*,\\\\\\\\nwhatever they are: social network updates, logs, or anything else.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis allows us to use lists as a capped collection, only remembering the latest\\\\\\\\nN items and discarding all the oldest items using the [`LTRIM`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`LTRIM`]() command is similar to [`LRANGE`](), but **instead of displaying the\\\\\\\\nspecified range of elements** it sets this range as the new list value. All\\\\\\\\nthe elements outside the given range are removed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you\\'re adding bikes on the end of a list of repairs, but only\\\\\\\\nwant to worry about the 3 that have been on the list the longest:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs 0 2\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above [`LTRIM`]() command tells Redis to keep just list elements from index\\\\\\\\n0 to 2, everything else will be discarded. This allows for a very simple but\\\\\\\\nuseful pattern: doing a List push operation + a List trim operation together \\\\\\\\nto add a new element and discard elements exceeding a limit. Using \\\\\\\\n[`LTRIM`]() with negative indexes can then be used to keep only the 3 most recently added:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs -3 -1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above combination adds new elements and keeps only the 3\\\\\\\\nnewest elements into the list. With [`LRANGE`]() you can access the top items\\\\\\\\nwithout any need to remember very old data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: while [`LRANGE`]() is technically an O(N) command, accessing small ranges\\\\\\\\ntowards the head or the tail of the list is a constant time operation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.434,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redistimeseries 1.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.0.0 (June 2019) > Features\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In RedisTimeSeries, we are introducing a new data type that uses chunks of memory of fixed size for time series samples, indexed by the same [Radix Tree implementation](https://github.com/antirez/rax) as Redis Streams.

Seasonally, you can measure average rainfall depth, average daily temperature, and the maximum number of sunny hours per day, for example. Watch the increase of the maximum daily temperature over the years. Predict the expected temperature and rainfall depth in a specific location for a particular week of the year.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultiple time series can be collected, each for a different location. By utilizing secondary indexes, measurements can be aggregated over given geographical regions (e.g., minimal and maximal daily temperature in Europe) or over locations with specific attributes (e.g., average rainfall depth in mountainous regions).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample metrics include: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Rain (cm)\\\\\\\\n- Temperature (C)\\\\\\\\n- Sunny periods (h)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Analysis of the atmosphere (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe atmospheric concentration of CO2 is more important than ever before. Use TimeSeries to track average, maximum and minimum CO2 level per season and average yearly CO2 over the last decades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Concentration of CO2 (ppm)\\\\\\\\n- Location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Flight data recording (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlanes have a multitude of sensors. This sensor data is stored in a black box and also shared with external systems. TimeSeries can help you reconstruct the sequence of events over time, optimize operations and maintenance intervals, improve safety, and provide feedback to the equipment manufacturers about the part quality. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Altitude\\\\\\\\n- Flight path\\\\\\\\n- Engine temperature\\\\\\\\n- Level of vibrations\\\\\\\\n- Pressure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ship logbooks (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s very common to keep track of ship voyages via (digital) logbooks. Use TimeSeries to calculate optimal routes using these metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Wind (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Ocean conditions (classes)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (knots)\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Connected car (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern cars are exposing several metrics via a standard interface. Use TimeSeries to correlate average fuel consumption with the tire pressure, figure out how long to keep a car in the fleet, determine optimal maintenance intervals, and calculate tax savings by type of the road (taxable vs. nontaxable roads). Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Acceleration\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n- Fuel level (liter)\\\\\\\\n- Distances (km)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Tire pressure\\\\\\\\n- Distance until next maintenance check\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Smart metering (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern houses and facilities gather details about energy consumption/production. Use Redis Time Series to aggregate billing based on monthly consumption. Optimize the network by redirecting the energy delivery relative to the fluctuations in need. Provide recommendations on how to improve the energy consumption behavior. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Consumption per location\\\\\\\\n- Produced amount of electrical energy per location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Quality of service (telecom)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMobile phone usage is increasing, producing a natural growth that just correlates to the increasing number of cellphones. However, there might also be spikes that correlate with specific events (for example, more messages around world championships). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTelecom providers need to ensure that they are providing the necessary infrastructure to deliver the right quality of service. This includes using mini towers for short-term peaks. Use TimeSeries to correlate traffic peaks to specific events, load balance traffic over several towers or mini towers, and predictively plan the infrastructure. Metrics include the amount of traffic per tower.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Stock trading (finance)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStock trading is highly automated today. Algorithms, and not just human beings, are trading, from the amount of bids and asks for the trading of a stock to the extreme volumes of trades per second (millions of ops per second). Computer-driven trading requires millisecond response times. It\\'s necessary to keep a lot of data points within a very short period of time (for example, price fluctuations per second within a minute). In addition, the long-term history needs to be kept to make statements about trends or for regulatory purposes.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse Redis Time Series to identify correlations between the trading behavior and other events (for example, social network posts). Discover a developing market. Detect anomalies to discover insider trades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Exact time and order of a trade by itself\\\\\\\\n- Type of the event (trade/bid)\\\\\\\\n- The stock price\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_3mp4x65wIVnuOEXfZSNBqy', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.8071,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"608370db\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"608370db-009\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/timeseries/configuration.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration Parameters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Time series configuration parameters > RETENTION_POLICY / ts-retention-policy > Example\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Because the retention can be provided at different levels, the actual precedence of the retention is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Both are probabilistic structures that trade perfect accuracy for memory efficiency.\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### Purpose\n- **Count-Min Sketch**: Answers \"How many times has element X appeared?\" for any element you query\n- **Top-K**: Answers \"What are the K most frequent elements?\" and tracks only the top K items\n\n### Data Structure\n- **CMS**: Uses a hash table with multiple hash functions (width × depth matrix) to store probabilistic counts\n- **Top-K**: Uses two structures in tandem:\n  - Hash table for probabilistic counts (similar to CMS)\n  - Min heap holding the K items with highest counts\n\n### Algorithm\n- **CMS**: Based on the classic Count-Min Sketch algorithm with collision-based over-counting\n- **Top-K**: Based on [HeavyKeepers algorithm](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong) with \"count-with-exponential-decay\" strategy\n\n### Memory & Accuracy Trade-offs\n- **CMS**: \n  - Uses sub-linear space\n  - Over-counts due to collisions\n  - Results below threshold (error_rate × total_count) should be ignored as noise\n  - Only useful for higher counts; low counts are unreliable\n\n- **Top-K**:\n  - More memory efficient than Sorted Sets for tracking top items\n  - Biased against \"mouse flows\" (small counts), limited impact on \"elephant flows\" (large counts)\n  - Higher accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms\n\n### Query Capabilities\n- **CMS**: Query frequency of any specific element(s) with `CMS.QUERY`\n- **Top-K**: \n  - List all top K items with `TOPK.LIST` (O(K×log(k)))\n  - Check if specific item is in top K with `TOPK.QUERY`\n  - Get counts for specific items with `TOPK.COUNT`\n\n### Use Cases\n\n**Count-Min Sketch**:\n- Product sales volume tracking (retail)\n- Any scenario where you need frequency estimates for many different elements\n- When you know which elements to query in advance\n\n**Top-K**:\n- Trending hashtags on social media\n- Network anomaly/DDoS detection (sudden spike in requests)\n- Most-read news articles\n- When you need to identify the top performers without knowing them in advance\n\n## Overlap & When to Choose\n\nThe documentation notes: \"There is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases.\"\n\n**Choose Count-Min Sketch when**:\n- You need to query frequencies of specific known elements\n- You're tracking many elements but only care about high-frequency ones\n- You can tolerate noise in low-count results\n\n**Choose Top-K when**:\n- You need to discover which elements are most frequent (not just count them)\n- You want real-time notifications when elements enter/leave the top K\n- You need efficient listing of top items without maintaining a full Sorted Set\n\n[来源:

estimate the frequency of events/elements in a stream of data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt uses a sub-linear space at the expense of over-counting some events due to collisions. It consumes a stream of events/elements and keeps estimated counters of their frequency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is very important to know that the results coming from a Count-Min sketch lower than a certain threshold (determined by the error_rate) should be ignored and often even approximated to zero.

Products with low percentage of the total sales are ignored.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAssume you select an error rate of 0.1% (0.001) with a certainty of 99.8% (0.998). This means you have an error probability of 0.02% (0.002). Your sketch strives to keep the error within 0.1% of the total count of all elements you\\'ve added. There\\'s a 0.02% chance the error might exceed this—like when an element below the threshold overlaps with one above it. When you add a few items to the CMS and evaluate their frequency, remember that in such a small sample, collisions are rare, as seen with other probabilistic data structures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INITBYPROB bikes:profit 0.001 0.002\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 100\\\\\\\\n(integer) 100\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 200 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 150\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n> CMS.QUERY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Terrible Bike Name\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 100\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INFO bikes:profit\\\\\\\\n1) width\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 2000\\\\\\\\n3) depth\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 9\\\\\\\\n5) count\\\\\\\\n6) (integer) 450\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.4218,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"73073dca\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"73073dca-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/top-k.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Top-K\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Use case\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Top K is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Open Source used to estimate the `K` highest-rank elements from a stream.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Highest-rank\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in this case means \\\\\\\\\\\\\"elements with a highest number or score attached to them\\\\\\\\\\\\\", where the score can be a count of how many times the element has appeared in the stream - thus making the data structure perfect for finding the elements with the highest frequency in a stream.\\\\\\\\nOne very common application is detecting network anomalies and DDoS attacks where Top K can answer the question: Is there a sudden increase in the flux of requests to the same address or from the same IP?\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Open Source implementation of Top-K is based on the [HeavyKeepers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong) algorithm presented by Junzhi Gong et al. It discards some older approaches like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"count-all\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"admit-all-count-some\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in favour of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**count-with-exponential-decay**\\\\\\\\\\\\\" strategy which is biased against mouse (small) flows and has a limited impact on elephant (large) flows. This implementation uses two data structures in tandem: a hash table that holds the probabilistic counts (much like the Count-Min Sketch), and a min heap that holds the `K` items with the highest counts. This ensures high accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms allowed, while keeping memory utilization to a fraction of what is typically required by a Sorted Set.

Redis already supports key expiration. For each key, users can specify a time when it should expire, or specify the remaining time-to-live (TTL) after which it would expire. One very frequent request was to allow specifying expiration time or TTL also for individual hash fields, which is now supported using nine new Redis commands:\\\\\\\\n- `HEXPIRE`, `HPEXPIRE`, `HEXPIREAT`, `HPEXPIREAT` - set the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields. \\\\\\\\n- `HTTL`, `HPTTL`, `HEXPIRETIME`, `HPEXPIRETIME` - retrieve the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields\\\\\\\\n- `HPERSIST` - remove the expiration of specific hash fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Streams`: It is now possible to start reading from the last stream message using `XREAD` with the new id value `+`.\\\\\\\\nThere are many additional improvements, including new command arguments, security, performance, and resource utilization enhancements, several new metrics and configuration parameters were introduced, and multiple bugs were fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Time series`: The latest time series data structure adds a highly requested feature: insertion-filter for close samples. Many sensors report data periodically. Often, the difference between the measured value and the previously measured value is negligible and related to random noise or to measurement accuracy limitations. When both the time difference and the value difference between the current and the previous sample are small, it may be preferable to ignore (not to add) the new measurement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`JSON`: Introduces a fix to avoid duplicating AOF commands multiple times in `JSON.MSET`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Probabilistic`: Now, an error is returned if `CMS.MERGE` results in an overflow or underflow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and query**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- New `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` vector data types reduce memory consumed by vectors while preserving accuracy.\\\\\\\\n- Support for indexing empty and missing values and enhanced developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities.\\\\\\\\n- Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax simpler.\\\\\\\\n- Geospatial search capabilities have been expanded with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, and ergonomics have been improved by providing better reporting of the memory consumed by the index and exposing the Full-text scoring in the aggregation pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf one or more fields of a hash key expire after a query begins (using FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE), Redis does not account for these lazily expired fields. As a result, keys with expired fields may still be included in the query results, leading to potentially incorrect or inconsistent results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Removal of triggers and functions**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Stack 7.4 will no longer include triggers and functions.

The Redis implementation uses up to 12 KB of memory and provides a standard error rate of 0.81%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCounting unique items usually requires an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items you want to count, because you need\\\\\\\\nto remember the elements you have already seen in the past in order to avoid\\\\\\\\ncounting them multiple times. However, a set of algorithms exist that trade \\\\\\\\nmemory for precision: they return an estimated measure with a standard error, \\\\\\\\nwhich, in the case of the Redis implementation for HyperLogLog, is less than 1%.\\\\\\\\nThe magic of this algorithm is that you no longer need to use an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items counted, and instead can use a\\\\\\\\nconstant amount of memory; 12k bytes in the worst case, or a lot less if your\\\\\\\\nHyperLogLog (We\\'ll just call them HLL from now) has seen very few elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHLLs in Redis, while technically a different data structure, are encoded\\\\\\\\nas a Redis string, so you can call [`GET`]() to serialize a HLL, and [`SET`]()\\\\\\\\nto deserialize it back to the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConceptually the HLL API is like using Sets to do the same task. You would\\\\\\\\n[`SADD`]() every observed element into a set, and would use [`SCARD`]() to check the\\\\\\\\nnumber of elements inside the set, which are unique since [`SADD`]() will not\\\\\\\\nre-add an existing element.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile you don\\'t really *add items* into an HLL, because the data structure\\\\\\\\nonly contains a state that does not include actual elements, the API is the\\\\\\\\nsame:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time you see a new element, you add it to the count with [`PFADD`]().\\\\\\\\n* When you want to retrieve the current approximation of unique elements added using the [`PFADD`]() command, you can use the [`PFCOUNT`]() command. If you need to merge two different HLLs, the [`PFMERGE`]() command is available. Since HLLs provide approximate counts of unique elements, the result of the merge will give you an approximation of the number of unique elements across both source HLLs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> PFADD bikes Hyperion Deimos Phoebe Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> PFADD commuter_bikes Salacia Mimas Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFMERGE all_bikes bikes commuter_bikes\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT all_bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome examples of use cases for this data structure is counting unique queries\\\\\\\\nperformed by users in a search form every day, number of unique visitors to a web page and other similar cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is also able to perform the union of HLLs, please check the\\\\\\\\n[full documentation]() for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Anonymous unique visits of a web page (SaaS, analytics tools)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- How many unique visits has this page had on this day? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have played this song? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have viewed this video? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nStoring the IP address or any other kind of personal identifier is against the law in some countries, which makes it impossible to get unique visitor statistics on your website.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne HyperLogLog is created per page (video/song) per period, and every IP/identifier is added to it on every visit.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6159,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d42c8ffb\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d42c8ffb-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/bloom/commands.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Commands\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Top-k commands\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"| Command | Redis<br />Software | Redis<br />Cloud | Description |\\\\\\\\n|:--------|:----------------------|:-----------------|:------|\\\\\\\\n| [TOPK.ADD]() | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Supported</span><br /><span><br /></span> | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\"><nobr>&#x2705; Flexible & Annual</nobr></span><br /><span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Free & Fixed</nobr></span> | Adds an item to the data structure. |\\\\\\\\n| [TOPK.COUNT]() | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Supported</span><br /><span><br /></span> | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Flexible & Annual</span><br /><span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Free & Fixed</nobr></span> | Returns probable item counts. |\\\\\\\\n| [TOPK.INCRBY]() | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Supported</span><br /><span><br /></span> | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Flexible & Annual</span><br /><span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Free & Fixed</nobr></span> | Increases the score of an item by the specified number. |\\\\\\\\n| [TOPK.INFO]() | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Supported</span><br /><span><br /></span> | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Flexible & Annual</span><br /><span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Free & Fixed</nobr></span> | Returns the number of required items (k), width, depth, and decay values. |\\\\\\\\n| [TOPK.LIST]() | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Supported</span><br /><span><br /></span> | <span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Flexible & Annual</span><br /><span title=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Supported\\\\\\\\\\\\\">&#x2705; Free & Fixed</nobr></span> | Returns the keys of items in the top-k list.

Here's how it works:\n\n## Failover Detection\n\n**Two-stage failure detection:**\n- **SDOWN (Subjectively Down)**: A single Sentinel marks the master as down when it doesn't receive valid PING replies for the configured timeout period (`down-after-milliseconds`)\n- **ODOWN (Objectively Down)**: Multiple Sentinels (at least the configured `quorum`) agree the master is down through gossip protocol using `SENTINEL is-master-down-by-addr` commands\n\nOnly when ODOWN state is reached can a failover be triggered.\n\n## Failover Process\n\n1. **Authorization**: A Sentinel must receive authorization from the majority of known Sentinels before starting failover\n\n2. **Replica Selection**: The system evaluates replicas based on:\n   - Disconnection time from master (replicas disconnected > 10x timeout are skipped)\n   - `replica-priority` (lower is preferred)\n   - Replication offset (replica with most data wins)\n   - Run ID (lexicographically smaller, for determinism)\n\n3. **Promotion**: The selected replica receives `REPLICAOF NO ONE` command to become the new master\n\n4. **Configuration Propagation**: Once the switch is confirmed via `INFO` output, the new configuration (with incremented version number) is broadcast via `__sentinel__:hello` Pub/Sub channel\n\n5. **Reconfiguration**: Other replicas are reconfigured to replicate from the new master. All Sentinels converge to the highest version number configuration.\n\n## Key Properties\n\n- **Distributed system**: Multiple Sentinels cooperate to reduce false positives and eliminate single points of failure\n- **Service discovery**: Clients connect to Sentinels to discover the current master address\n- **Self-healing**: Failed masters are automatically reconfigured as replicas when they return\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Sentinel as a distributed system, SDOWN and ODOWN failure state, Replica selection and priority, Configuration propagation]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "failover", "master", "AOF", "replication", "replica", "OBJECT", "MULTI", "EVAL", "Lua"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "55063c1a-626a-4670-a7c3-855caf1041f3", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "9e9eda0b-a8dc-4ecb-acb9-b78fdef75bd4", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Redis Sentinel's automatic failover handling.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_bNBO5f6BbPlACr9RP1zGnU', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Sentinel automatic failover process', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_ReSs4z7cSWoK81B9GUpyWF', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'Sentinel.*failover|failover.*Sentinel'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_bNBO5f6BbPlACr9RP1zGnU', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.1327,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis service discovery via Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel is a monitoring solution for Redis instances that handles\\\\\\\\nautomatic failover of Redis masters and service discovery (who is the current\\\\\\\\nmaster for a given group of instances?).

Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties.

The replicas are sorted by `replica-priority` as configured in the `redis.conf` file of the Redis instance. A lower priority will be preferred.\\\\\\\\n2. If the priority is the same, the replication offset processed by the replica is checked, and the replica that received more data from the master is selected.\\\\\\\\n3. If multiple replicas have the same priority and processed the same data from the master, a further check is performed, selecting the replica with the lexicographically smaller run ID. Having a lower run ID is not a real advantage for a replica, but is useful in order to make the process of replica selection more deterministic, instead of resorting to select a random replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most cases, `replica-priority` does not need to be set explicitly so all\\\\\\\\ninstances will use the same default value.

Another is called *Objectively Down*\\\\\\\\ncondition (ODOWN) and is reached when enough Sentinels (at least the\\\\\\\\nnumber configured as the `quorum` parameter of the monitored master) have\\\\\\\\nan SDOWN condition, and get feedback from other Sentinels using\\\\\\\\nthe `SENTINEL is-master-down-by-addr` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of a Sentinel an SDOWN condition is reached when it\\\\\\\\ndoes not receive a valid reply to PING requests for the number of seconds\\\\\\\\nspecified in the configuration as `is-master-down-after-milliseconds`\\\\\\\\nparameter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn acceptable reply to PING is one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with +PONG.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -LOADING error.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -MASTERDOWN error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAny other reply (or no reply at all) is considered non valid.\\\\\\\\nHowever note that **a logical master that advertises itself as a replica in\\\\\\\\nthe INFO output is considered to be down**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that SDOWN requires that no acceptable reply is received for the whole\\\\\\\\ninterval configured, so for instance if the interval is 30000 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n(30 seconds) and we receive an acceptable ping reply every 29 seconds, the\\\\\\\\ninstance is considered to be working.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSDOWN is not enough to trigger a failover: it only means a single Sentinel\\\\\\\\nbelieves a Redis instance is not available. To trigger a failover, the\\\\\\\\nODOWN state must be reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo switch from SDOWN to ODOWN no strong consensus algorithm is used, but\\\\\\\\njust a form of gossip: if a given Sentinel gets reports that a master\\\\\\\\nis not working from enough Sentinels **in a given time range**, the SDOWN is\\\\\\\\npromoted to ODOWN. If this acknowledge is later missing, the flag is cleared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA more strict authorization that uses an actual majority is required in\\\\\\\\norder to really start the failover, but no failover can be triggered without\\\\\\\\nreaching the ODOWN state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ODOWN condition **only applies to masters**. For other kind of instances\\\\\\\\nSentinel doesn\\'t require to act, so the ODOWN state is never reached for replicas\\\\\\\\nand other sentinels, but only SDOWN is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever SDOWN has also semantic implications. For example a replica in SDOWN\\\\\\\\nstate is not selected to be promoted by a Sentinel performing a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels and replicas auto discovery\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels stay connected with other Sentinels in order to reciprocally\\\\\\\\ncheck the availability of each other, and to exchange messages. However you\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t need to configure a list of other Sentinel addresses in every Sentinel\\\\\\\\ninstance you run, as Sentinel uses the Redis instances Pub/Sub capabilities\\\\\\\\nin order to discover the other Sentinels that are monitoring the same masters\\\\\\\\nand replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is implemented by sending *hello messages* into the channel named\\\\\\\\n`__sentinel__:hello`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly you don\\'t need to configure what is the list of the replicas attached\\\\\\\\nto a master, as Sentinel will auto discover this list querying Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel publishes a message to every monitored master and replica Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello`, every two seconds, announcing its presence with ip, port, runid.\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel is subscribed to the Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello` of every master and replica, looking for unknown sentinels. When new sentinels are detected, they are added as sentinels of this master.\\\\\\\\n* Hello messages also include the full current configuration of the master. If the receiving Sentinel has a configuration for a given master which is older than the one received, it updates to the new configuration immediately.\\\\\\\\n* Before adding a new sentinel to a master a Sentinel always checks if there is already a sentinel with the same runid or the same address (ip and port pair). In that case all the matching sentinels are removed, and the new added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel reconfiguration of instances outside the failover procedure\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven when no failover is in progress, Sentinels will always try to set the\\\\\\\\ncurrent configuration on monitored instances.

Redis Cluster 将整个键空间划分为 16384 个槽位\n   - 每个 key 通过 `CRC16(key) % 16384` 计算出所属的 hash slot\n   - 每个节点负责一部分 hash slots\n\n2. **节点分配示例**（3 节点集群）：\n   - Node A: hash slots 0-5500\n   - Node B: hash slots 5501-11000  \n   - Node C: hash slots 11001-16383\n\n### Hash Slot 的优势\n\n- **易于扩缩容**：添加/删除节点只需移动 hash slots，无需停机\n- **灵活调整**：可以精确控制每个节点负责的槽位数量\n- **原子迁移**：使用 `MIGRATE` 命令原子性地迁移 key\n\n## Hash Tags（哈希标签）\n\n为了支持多 key 操作，Redis Cluster 实现了 hash tags 机制：\n\n### 计算规则\n\n- 如果 key 包含 `{...}` 模式，只对花括号内的内容计算 hash\n- 例如：`{user1000}.following` 和 `{user1000}.followers` 会被分配到同一个 slot\n\n### 示例\n\n```bash\n# 这两个 key 会在同一个 slot，可以执行多 key 操作\nSINTER {group}:1 {group}:2\n\n# 用户相关数据保证在同一节点\nuser:{123}:profile\nuser:{123}:account\n```\n\n### Hash Tag 算法\n\n```c\nunsigned int HASH_SLOT(char *key, int keylen) {\n    int s, e;\n    \n    // 查找第一个 '{'\n    for (s = 0; s < keylen; s++)\n        if (key[s] == '{') break;\n    \n    // 没有 '{' 则 hash 整个 key\n    if (s == keylen) return crc16(key,keylen) & 16383;\n    \n    // 查找对应的 '}'\n    for (e = s+1; e < keylen; e++)\n        if (key[e] == '}') break;\n    \n    // 没有 '}' 或 {} 之间为空，则 hash 整个 key\n    if (e == keylen || e == s+1) return crc16(key,keylen) & 16383;\n    \n    // hash {} 之间的内容\n    return crc16(key+s+1,e-s-1) & 16383;\n}\n```\n\n## Slot 迁移（Resharding）\n\n### 迁移过程\n\n1. **设置迁移状态**：\n   ```bash\n   # 目标节点 B 设置为 IMPORTING\n   CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 IMPORTING A\n   \n   # 源节点 A 设置为 MIGRATING  \n   CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 MIGRATING B\n   ```\n\n2. **迁移行为**：\n   - **MIGRATING 状态**：节点 A 只处理已存在的 key，新 key 重定向到 B（`-ASK`）\n   - **IMPORTING 状态**：节点 B 只处理带 `ASKING` 命令的请求\n\n3. **原子迁移 key**：\n   ```bash\n   CLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT slot count  # 获取 slot 中的 keys\n   MIGRATE target_host target_port \"\" 0 timeout KEYS key1 key2 ...\n   ```\n\n4. **完成迁移**：\n   ```bash\n   CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 NODE <node-id>  # 设置 slot 归属\n   ```\n\n## Slot 配置传播\n\nRedis Cluster 通过两种方式传播 slot 配置：\n\n1. **心跳消息**：每个 ping/pong 包含节点负责的 hash slots 信息\n2. **UPDATE 消息**：当检测到配置过期时，强制更新\n\n### 配置更新规则\n\n- **Rule 1**：未分配的 slot，接受第一个声明的节点\n- **Rule 2**：已分配的 slot，接受 `configEpoch` 更大的节点（**last failover wins**）\n\n## 客户端重定向\n\n- **MOVED 错误**：slot 已永久迁移到其他节点\n  ```\n  -MOVED 3999 127.0.0.1:6381\n  ```\n  \n- **ASK 错误**：slot 正在迁移中，临时重定向\n  ```\n  -ASK 3999 127.0.0.1:6381\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**来源**：\n- [Redis cluster specification > Hash slots configuration propagation](/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md)\n- [Scale with Redis Cluster > Redis Cluster master-replica model](/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md)\n- [Redis cluster specification > Hash tags](/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md)", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/keyspace.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["failover", "master", "cluster", "hash slot", "16384", "user", "replica"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/keyspace.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "a4b57866-1ada-480c-b9b0-fd259884544e", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "512fe886-c657-4d6b-a39f-40528d6382fb", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来帮你检索 Redis cluster 数据分片和 hash slot 机制的相关信息。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_NY91oFOror9ihATCImcSxl', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis cluster 数据分片 hash slot 机制', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_u9Gl3Ab10Wtgsp1Yd4Gzln', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs/', 'pattern': 'hash slot|哈希槽|数据分片|cluster.*shard'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_NY91oFOror9ihATCImcSxl', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7211,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-025\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration handling, propagation, and failovers > Hash slots configuration propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"An important part of Redis Cluster is the mechanism used to propagate the information about which cluster node is serving a given set of hash slots. This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.6471,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > Live reconfiguration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster supports the ability to add and remove nodes while the cluster\\\\\\\\nis running. Adding or removing a node is abstracted into the same\\\\\\\\noperation: moving a hash slot from one node to another. This means\\\\\\\\nthat the same basic mechanism can be used in order to rebalance the cluster, add\\\\\\\\nor remove nodes, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To add a new node to the cluster an empty node is added to the cluster and some set of hash slots are moved from existing nodes to the new node.\\\\\\\\n* To remove a node from the cluster the hash slots assigned to that node are moved to other existing nodes.\\\\\\\\n* To rebalance the cluster a given set of hash slots are moved between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe core of the implementation is the ability to move hash slots around.\\\\\\\\nFrom a practical point of view a hash slot is just a set of keys, so\\\\\\\\nwhat Redis Cluster really does during *resharding* is to move keys from\\\\\\\\nan instance to another instance. Moving a hash slot means moving all the keys\\\\\\\\nthat happen to hash into this hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo understand how this works we need to show the [`CLUSTER`](/commands/cluster) subcommands\\\\\\\\nthat are used to manipulate the slots translation table in a Redis Cluster node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following subcommands are available (among others not useful in this case):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-delslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-addslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-delslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot NODE node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot MIGRATING node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot IMPORTING node\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first four commands, `ADDSLOTS`, `DELSLOTS`, `ADDSLOTSRANGE` and `DELSLOTSRANGE`, are simply used to assign\\\\\\\\n(or remove) slots to a Redis node. Assigning a slot means to tell a given\\\\\\\\nmaster node that it will be in charge of storing and serving content for\\\\\\\\nthe specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the hash slots are assigned they will propagate across the cluster\\\\\\\\nusing the gossip protocol, as specified later in the\\\\\\\\n*configuration propagation* section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `ADDSLOTS` and `ADDSLOTSRANGE` commands are usually used when a new cluster is created\\\\\\\\nfrom scratch to assign each master node a subset of all the 16384 hash\\\\\\\\nslots available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `DELSLOTS`  and `DELSLOTSRANGE` are mainly used for manual modification of a cluster configuration\\\\\\\\nor for debugging tasks: in practice it is rarely used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `SETSLOT` subcommand is used to assign a slot to a specific node ID if\\\\\\\\nthe `SETSLOT <slot> NODE` form is used. Otherwise the slot can be set in the\\\\\\\\ntwo special states `MIGRATING` and `IMPORTING`. Those two special states\\\\\\\\nare used in order to migrate a hash slot from one node to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as MIGRATING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the key in question\\\\\\\\nexists, otherwise the query is forwarded using a `-ASK` redirection to the\\\\\\\\nnode that is target of the migration.\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as IMPORTING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the request is\\\\\\\\npreceded by an [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command. If the [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command was not given\\\\\\\\nby the client, the query is redirected to the real hash slot owner via\\\\\\\\na `-MOVED` redirection error, as would happen normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s make this clearer with an example of hash slot migration.\\\\\\\\nAssume that we have two Redis master nodes, called A and B.\\\\\\\\nWe want to move hash slot 8 from A to B, so we issue commands like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We send B: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 IMPORTING A\\\\\\\\n* We send A: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 MIGRATING B\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll the other nodes will continue to point clients to node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" every time\\\\\\\\nthey are queried with a key that belongs to hash slot 8, so what happens\\\\\\\\nis that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* All queries about existing keys are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* All queries about non-existing keys in A are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\", because \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will redirect clients to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis way we no longer create new keys in \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\nIn the meantime, `redis-cli` used during reshardings\\\\\\\\nand Redis Cluster configuration will migrate existing keys in\\\\\\\\nhash slot 8 from A to B.\\\\\\\\nThis is performed using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT slot count\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will return `count` keys in the specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\nFor keys returned, `redis-cli` sends node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) command, that\\\\\\\\nwill migrate the specified keys from A to B in an atomic way (both instances\\\\\\\\nare locked for the time (usually very small time) needed to migrate keys so\\\\\\\\nthere are no race conditions). This is how [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    MIGRATE target_host target_port \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\" target_database id timeout KEYS key1 key2 ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) will connect to the target instance, send a serialized version of\\\\\\\\nthe key, and once an OK code is received, the old key from its own dataset\\\\\\\\nwill be deleted. From the point of view of an external client a key exists\\\\\\\\neither in A or B at any given time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis Cluster there is no need to specify a database other than 0, but\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is a general command that can be used for other tasks not\\\\\\\\ninvolving Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is optimized to be as fast as possible even when moving complex\\\\\\\\nkeys such as long lists, but in Redis Cluster reconfiguring the\\\\\\\\ncluster where big keys are present is not considered a wise procedure if\\\\\\\\nthere are latency constraints in the application using the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the migration process is finally finished, the `SETSLOT <slot> NODE <node-id>` command is sent to the two nodes involved in the migration in order to\\\\\\\\nset the slots to their normal state again. The same command is usually\\\\\\\\nsent to all other nodes to avoid waiting for the natural\\\\\\\\npropagation of the new configuration across the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5596,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Hash tags\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"There is an exception for the computation of the hash slot that is used in order\\\\\\\\nto implement **hash tags**. Hash tags are a way to ensure that multiple keys\\\\\\\\nare allocated in the same hash slot. This is used in order to implement\\\\\\\\nmulti-key operations in Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo implement hash tags, the hash slot for a key is computed in a\\\\\\\\nslightly different way in certain conditions.\\\\\\\\nIf the key contains a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{...}\\\\\\\\\\\\\" pattern only the substring between\\\\\\\\n`{` and `}` is hashed in order to obtain the hash slot. However since it is\\\\\\\\npossible that there are multiple occurrences of `{` or `}` the algorithm is\\\\\\\\nwell specified by the following rules:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* IF the key contains a `{` character.\\\\\\\\n* AND IF there is a `}` character to the right of `{`.\\\\\\\\n* AND IF there are one or more characters between the first occurrence of `{` and the first occurrence of `}`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen instead of hashing the key, only what is between the first occurrence of `{` and the following first occurrence of `}` is hashed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExamples:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The two keys `{user1000}.following` and `{user1000}.followers` will hash to the same hash slot since only the substring `user1000` will be hashed in order to compute the hash slot.\\\\\\\\n* For the key `foo{}{bar}` the whole key will be hashed as usual since the first occurrence of `{` is followed by `}` on the right without characters in the middle.\\\\\\\\n* For the key `foo{{bar}}zap` the substring `{bar` will be hashed, because it is the substring between the first occurrence of `{` and the first occurrence of `}` on its right.\\\\\\\\n* For the key `foo{bar}{zap}` the substring `bar` will be hashed, since the algorithm stops at the first valid or invalid (without bytes inside) match of `{` and `}`.\\\\\\\\n* What follows from the algorithm is that if the key starts with `{}`, it is guaranteed to be hashed as a whole. This is useful when using binary data as key names.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.4976,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster 101 > Redis Cluster master-replica model\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster does not use consistent hashing, but a different form of sharding\\\\\\\\nwhere every key is conceptually part of what we call a **hash slot**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute the hash\\\\\\\\nslot for a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo\\\\\\\\n16384.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,\\\\\\\\nso, for example, you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.\\\\\\\\n* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.\\\\\\\\n* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes it easy to add and remove cluster nodes. For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.1665,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Main properties and rationales of the design > Implemented subset\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster is a distributed implementation of Redis with the following goals in order of importance in the design:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* High performance and linear scalability up to 1000 nodes.

Usually there are small windows where acknowledged writes can be lost. Windows to lose acknowledged writes are larger when clients are in a minority partition.\\\\\\\\n* Availability: Redis Cluster is able to survive partitions where the majority of the master nodes are reachable and there is at least one reachable replica for every master node that is no longer reachable.

Redis provides a range of persistence options. These include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RDB** (Redis Database): RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.\\\\\\\\n* **AOF** (Append Only File): AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server. These operations can then be replayed again at server startup, reconstructing the original dataset. Commands are logged using the same format as the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n* **No persistence**: You can disable persistence completely. This is sometimes used when caching.\\\\\\\\n* **RDB + AOF**: You can also combine both AOF and RDB in the same instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\'d rather not think about the tradeoffs between these different persistence strategies, you may want to consider [Redis Software\\'s persistence options](), which can be pre-configured using a UI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about how to evaluate your Redis persistence strategy, read on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is a very compact single-file point-in-time representation of your Redis data. RDB files are perfect for backups. For instance you may want to archive your RDB files every hour for the latest 24 hours, and to save an RDB snapshot every day for 30 days. This allows you to easily restore different versions of the data set in case of disasters.\\\\\\\\n* RDB is very good for disaster recovery, being a single compact file that can be transferred to far data centers, or onto Amazon S3 (possibly encrypted).\\\\\\\\n* RDB maximizes Redis performances since the only work the Redis parent process needs to do in order to persist is forking a child that will do all the rest. The parent process will never perform disk I/O or alike.\\\\\\\\n* RDB allows faster restarts with big datasets compared to AOF.\\\\\\\\n* On replicas, RDB supports [partial resynchronizations after restarts and failovers]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is NOT good if you need to minimize the chance of data loss in case Redis stops working (for example after a power outage). You can configure different *save points* where an RDB is produced (for instance after at least five minutes and 100 writes against the data set, you can have multiple save points). However you\\'ll usually create an RDB snapshot every five minutes or more, so in case of Redis stopping working without a correct shutdown for any reason you should be prepared to lose the latest minutes of data.\\\\\\\\n* RDB needs to fork() often in order to persist on disk using a child process. fork() can be time consuming if the dataset is big, and may result in Redis stopping serving clients for some milliseconds or even for one second if the dataset is very big and the CPU performance is not great. AOF also needs to fork() but less frequently and you can tune how often you want to rewrite your logs without any trade-off on durability.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.6804,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"AOF disadvantages\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Using AOF Redis is much more durable: you can have different fsync policies: no fsync at all, fsync every second, fsync at every query. With the default policy of fsync every second, write performance is still great. fsync is performed using a background thread and the main thread will try hard to perform writes when no fsync is in progress, so you can only lose one second worth of writes.\\\\\\\\n* The AOF log is an append-only log, so there are no seeks, nor corruption problems if there is a power outage. Even if the log ends with a half-written command for some reason (disk full or other reasons) the redis-check-aof tool is able to fix it easily.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is able to automatically rewrite the AOF in background when it gets too big. The rewrite is completely safe as while Redis continues appending to the old file, a completely new one is produced with the minimal set of operations needed to create the current data set, and once this second file is ready Redis switches the two and starts appending to the new one.\\\\\\\\n* AOF contains a log of all the operations one after the other in an easy to understand and parse format. You can even easily export an AOF file. For instance even if you\\'ve accidentally flushed everything using the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command, as long as no rewrite of the log was performed in the meantime, you can still save your data set just by stopping the server, removing the latest command, and restarting Redis again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF files are usually bigger than the equivalent RDB files for the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n* AOF can be slower than RDB depending on the exact fsync policy. In general with fsync set to *every second* performance is still very high, and with fsync disabled it should be exactly as fast as RDB even under high load. Still RDB is able to provide more guarantees about the maximum latency even in the case of a huge write load.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis < 7.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF can use a lot of memory if there are writes to the database during a rewrite (these are buffered in memory and written to the new AOF at the end).\\\\\\\\n* All write commands that arrive during rewrite are written to disk twice.\\\\\\\\n* Redis could freeze writing and fsyncing these write commands to the new AOF file at the end of the rewrite.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nOk, so what should I use?\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe general indication you should use both persistence methods is if\\\\\\\\nyou want a degree of data safety comparable to what PostgreSQL can provide you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you care a lot about your data, but still can live with a few minutes of\\\\\\\\ndata loss in case of disasters, you can simply use RDB alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are many users using AOF alone, but we discourage it since to have an\\\\\\\\nRDB snapshot from time to time is a great idea for doing database backups,\\\\\\\\nfor faster restarts, and in the event of bugs in the AOF engine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following sections will illustrate a few more details about the two persistence models.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.4318,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/arm.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ARM support\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance testing of Redis was performed on the Raspberry Pi 3 and Pi 1 model B.

Redis data types are closely related to fundamental data structures and are exposed to the programmer as such, without additional abstraction layers.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can\\'t be larger than memory. Another advantage of\\\\\\\\nin-memory databases is that the memory representation of complex data structures\\\\\\\\nis much simpler to manipulate compared to the same data structures on disk, so\\\\\\\\nRedis can do a lot with little internal complexity. At the same time the\\\\\\\\ntwo on-disk storage formats (RDB and AOF) don\\'t need to be suitable for random\\\\\\\\naccess, so they are compact and always generated in an append-only fashion\\\\\\\\n(Even the AOF log rotation is an append-only operation, since the new version\\\\\\\\nis generated from the copy of data in memory). However this design also involves\\\\\\\\ndifferent challenges compared to traditional on-disk stores. Being the main data\\\\\\\\nrepresentation on memory, Redis operations must be carefully handled to make sure\\\\\\\\nthere is always an updated version of the data set on disk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An empty instance uses ~ 3MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 85MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 160 MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting your use case is trivial. Use the `redis-benchmark` utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the `INFO memory` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n64-bit systems will use considerably more memory than 32-bit systems to store the same keys, especially if the keys and values are small. This is because pointers take 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. But of course the advantage is that you can\\\\\\\\nhave a lot of memory in 64-bit systems, so in order to run large Redis servers a 64-bit system is more or less required. The alternative is sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past the Redis developers experimented with Virtual Memory and other systems in order to allow larger than RAM datasets, but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well: data served from memory, disk used for storage. So for now there are no plans to create an on disk backend for Redis. Most of what\\\\\\\\nRedis is, after all, a direct result of its current design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf your real problem is not the total RAM needed, but the fact that you need\\\\\\\\nto split your data set into multiple Redis instances, please read the\\\\\\\\n[partitioning page]() in this documentation for more info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Ltd., the company sponsoring Redis development, has developed a\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis on Flash\\\\\\\\\\\\\" solution that uses a mixed RAM/flash approach for\\\\\\\\nlarger data sets with a biased access pattern.

Starting from Redis 6, you can create users with specific permissions to improve security and operational safety.\n\n## Basic ACL Configuration\n\n### 1. View Current ACL Configuration\n\n```bash\nACL LIST\n```\n\nThis shows all configured users. By default, you'll see:\n```\nuser default on nopass ~* &* +@all\n```\n\n### 2. Create a New User with Specific Permissions\n\nUse the `ACL SETUSER` command to create users with fine-grained permissions:\n\n```bash\nACL SETUSER <username> ON >password ~keypattern +command\n```\n\n**Example for Sentinel user:**\n```bash\nACL SETUSER sentinel-user ON >somepassword allchannels +multi +slaveof +ping +exec +subscribe +config|rewrite +role +publish +info +client|setname +client|kill +script|kill\n```\n\n### 3. ACL Rule Components\n\nThe ACL DSL (Domain Specific Language) uses these rule types:\n\n- **`on`/`off`**: Enable/disable the user\n- **`>password`**: Set user password\n- **`nopass`**: No password required (default user only)\n- **`~keypattern`**: Key access patterns (`~*` = all keys)\n- **`&channel`**: Pub/Sub channel access (`&*` = all channels, `allchannels` = all)\n- **`+command`**: Allow specific command (e.g., `+get`, `+set`)\n- **`+@category`**: Allow command category (e.g., `+@all`, `+@read`, `+@write`)\n- **`-command`**: Deny specific command\n\n### 4. Authentication\n\nClients authenticate using the extended AUTH command:\n\n```bash\nAUTH <username> <password>\n```\n\nOr the backward-compatible form (authenticates as \"default\" user):\n```bash\nAUTH <password>\n```\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n1. **Read-only user**: Restrict clients to only read operations\n2. **Prevent dangerous commands**: Block `FLUSHALL`, `CONFIG`, etc. to prevent accidental data loss\n3. **Key-based isolation**: Limit users to specific key patterns\n4. **Managed Redis instances**: Exclude configuration commands for customers\n\n## Configuration in redis.conf\n\nYou can also configure ACLs in the Redis configuration file using the same syntax:\n\n```\nuser worker on >workerpass ~jobs:* +@read +@write -@dangerous\n```\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md > \"When ACLs are useful\", \"Configure ACLs with the ACL command\"]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "ACL", "user", "permission", "MULTI", "EXEC", "script"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "b1a0f983-a7a9-4b56-98f0-9d21ad95f5d0", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "b3125824-3779-4436-ad82-a1629b88189a", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis ACL configuration for fine-grained access control.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_37vFietcWOU26FF8zqoiOB', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis ACL fine-grained access control configuration', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_GwD9php27X67hu03rIeXgo', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'ACL|access control list'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_37vFietcWOU26FF8zqoiOB', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5711,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ACL\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"When ACLs are useful\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis ACL, short for Access Control List, is the feature that allows certain\\\\\\\\nconnections to be limited in terms of the commands that can be executed and the\\\\\\\\nkeys that can be accessed. The way it works is that, after connecting, a client\\\\\\\\nis required to provide a username and a valid password to authenticate. If authentication succeeded, the connection is associated with a given\\\\\\\\nuser and the limits the user has. Redis can be configured so that new\\\\\\\\nconnections are already authenticated with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\" user (this is the\\\\\\\\ndefault configuration). Configuring the default user has, as a side effect,\\\\\\\\nthe ability to provide only a specific subset of functionalities to connections\\\\\\\\nthat are not explicitly authenticated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the default configuration, Redis 6 (the first version to have ACLs) works\\\\\\\\nexactly like older versions of Redis. Every new connection is\\\\\\\\ncapable of calling every possible command and accessing every key, so the\\\\\\\\nACL feature is backward compatible with old clients and applications. Also\\\\\\\\nthe old way to configure a password, using the **requirepass** configuration\\\\\\\\ndirective, still works as expected. However, it now\\\\\\\\nsets a password for the default user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command was extended in Redis 6, so now it is possible to\\\\\\\\nuse it in the two-arguments form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <username> <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of the old form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat happens is that the username used to authenticate is \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so\\\\\\\\njust specifying the password implies that we want to authenticate against\\\\\\\\nthe default user. This provides backward compatibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore using ACLs, you may want to ask yourself what\\'s the goal you want to\\\\\\\\naccomplish by implementing this layer of protection. Normally there are\\\\\\\\ntwo main goals that are well served by ACLs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You want to improve security by restricting the access to commands and keys, so that untrusted clients have no access and trusted clients have just the minimum access level to the database in order to perform the work needed. For instance, certain clients may just be able to execute read only commands.\\\\\\\\n2. You want to improve operational safety, so that processes or humans accessing Redis are not allowed to damage the data or the configuration due to software errors or manual mistakes. For instance, there is no reason for a worker that fetches delayed jobs from Redis to be able to call the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother typical usage of ACLs is related to managed Redis instances. Redis is\\\\\\\\noften provided as a managed service both by internal company teams that handle\\\\\\\\nthe Redis infrastructure for the other internal customers they have, or is\\\\\\\\nprovided in a software-as-a-service setup by cloud providers. In both \\\\\\\\nsetups, we want to be sure that configuration commands are excluded for the\\\\\\\\ncustomers.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.9972,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-019\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Access Control List authentication > Redis password-only authentication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Until Redis 6, authentication is achieved using the following configuration directives:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `requirepass` in the master, in order to set the authentication password, and to make sure the instance will not process requests for non authenticated clients.\\\\\\\\n* `masterauth` in the replicas in order for the replicas to authenticate with the master in order to correctly replicate data from it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Sentinel is used, there is not a single master, since after a failover\\\\\\\\nreplicas may play the role of masters, and old masters can be reconfigured in\\\\\\\\norder to act as replicas, so what you want to do is to set the above directives\\\\\\\\nin all your instances, both masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is also usually a sane setup since you don\\'t want to protect\\\\\\\\ndata only in the master, having the same data accessible in the replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, in the uncommon case where you need a replica that is accessible\\\\\\\\nwithout authentication, you can still do it by setting up **a replica priority\\\\\\\\nof zero**, to prevent this replica from being promoted to master, and\\\\\\\\nconfiguring in this replica only the `masterauth` directive, without\\\\\\\\nusing the `requirepass` directive, so that data will be readable by\\\\\\\\nunauthenticated clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order for Sentinels to connect to Redis server instances when they are\\\\\\\\nconfigured with `requirepass`, the Sentinel configuration must include the\\\\\\\\n`sentinel auth-pass` directive, in the format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel auth-pass <master-name> <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfiguring Sentinel instances with authentication\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel instances themselves can be secured by requiring clients to authenticate via the [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command.

Each master also takes an offset that\\\\\\\\nincrements for every byte of replication stream that it is produced to be\\\\\\\\nsent to replicas, to update the state of the replicas with the new changes\\\\\\\\nmodifying the dataset. The replication offset is incremented even if no replica\\\\\\\\nis actually connected, so basically every given pair of:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Replication ID, offset\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdentifies an exact version of the dataset of a master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen replicas connect to masters, they use the [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) command to send\\\\\\\\ntheir old master replication ID and the offsets they processed so far. This way\\\\\\\\nthe master can send just the incremental part needed. However if there is not\\\\\\\\nenough *backlog* in the master buffers, or if the replica is referring to an\\\\\\\\nhistory (replication ID) which is no longer known, then a full resynchronization\\\\\\\\nhappens: in this case the replica will get a full copy of the dataset, from scratch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how a full synchronization works in more details:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe master starts a background saving process to produce an RDB file. At the same time it starts to buffer all new write commands received from the clients. When the background saving is complete, the master transfers the database file to the replica, which saves it on disk, and then loads it into memory. The master will then send all buffered commands to the replica. This is done as a stream of commands and is in the same format of the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can try it yourself via telnet. Connect to the Redis port while the\\\\\\\\nserver is doing some work and issue the [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) command. You\\'ll see a bulk\\\\\\\\ntransfer and then every command received by the master will be re-issued\\\\\\\\nin the telnet session. Actually [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) is an old protocol no longer used by\\\\\\\\nnewer Redis instances, but is still there for backward compatibility: it does\\\\\\\\nnot allow partial resynchronizations, so now [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) is used instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs already said, replicas are able to automatically reconnect when the master-replica link goes down for some reason. If the master receives multiple concurrent replica synchronization requests, it performs a single background save in to serve all of them.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8985,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"At the base of Redis replication (excluding the high availability features provided as an additional layer by Redis Cluster or Redis Sentinel) there is a *leader follower* (master-replica) replication that is simple to use and configure. It allows replica Redis instances to be exact copies of master instances. The replica will automatically reconnect to the master every time the link breaks, and will attempt to be an exact copy of it *regardless* of what happens to the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis system works using three main mechanisms:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. When a master and a replica instance are well-connected, the master keeps the replica updated by sending a stream of commands to the replica to replicate the effects on the dataset happening on the master side due to: client writes, keys expired or evicted, any other action changing the master dataset.\\\\\\\\n2. When the link between the master and the replica breaks, for network issues or because a timeout is sensed in the master or the replica, the replica reconnects and attempts to proceed with a partial resynchronization: it means that it will try to just obtain the part of the stream of commands it missed during the disconnection.\\\\\\\\n3. When a partial resynchronization is not possible, the replica will ask for a full resynchronization. This will involve a more complex process in which the master needs to create a snapshot of all its data, send it to the replica, and then continue sending the stream of commands as the dataset changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses by default asynchronous replication, which being low latency and\\\\\\\\nhigh performance, is the natural replication mode for the vast majority of Redis\\\\\\\\nuse cases. However, Redis replicas asynchronously acknowledge the amount of data\\\\\\\\nthey receive periodically with the master. So the master does not wait every time\\\\\\\\nfor a command to be processed by the replicas, however it knows, if needed, what\\\\\\\\nreplica already processed what command. This allows having optional synchronous replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSynchronous replication of certain data can be requested by the clients using\\\\\\\\nthe [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) command. However [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) is only able to ensure there are the\\\\\\\\nspecified number of acknowledged copies in the other Redis instances, it does not\\\\\\\\nturn a set of Redis instances into a CP system with strong consistency: acknowledged\\\\\\\\nwrites can still be lost during a failover, depending on the exact configuration\\\\\\\\nof the Redis persistence. However, [WAIT]() dramatically reduces the probability of losing a write after a failure event to specific hard-to-trigger failure modes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can check the Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster documentation for more information\\\\\\\\nabout high availability and failover.

Aside from connecting a number of replicas to the same master, replicas can also be connected to other replicas in a cascading-like structure. Since Redis 4.0, all the sub-replicas will receive exactly the same replication stream from the master.\\\\\\\\n* Redis replication is non-blocking on the master side. This means that the master will continue to handle queries when one or more replicas perform the initial synchronization or a partial resynchronization.\\\\\\\\n* Replication is also largely non-blocking on the replica side. While the replica is performing the initial synchronization, it can handle queries using the old version of the dataset, assuming you configured Redis to do so in redis.conf.  Otherwise, you can configure Redis replicas to return an error to clients if the replication stream is down. However, after the initial sync, the old dataset must be deleted and the new one must be loaded. The replica will block incoming connections during this brief window (that can be as long as many seconds for very large datasets). Since Redis 4.0 you can configure Redis so that the deletion of the old data set happens in a different thread, however loading the new initial dataset will still happen in the main thread and block the replica.\\\\\\\\n* Replication can be used both for scalability, to have multiple replicas for read-only queries (for example, slow O(N) operations can be offloaded to replicas), or simply for improving data safety and high availability.\\\\\\\\n* You can use replication to avoid the cost of having the master writing the full dataset to disk: a typical technique involves configuring your master `redis.conf` to avoid persisting to disk at all, then connect a replica configured to save from time to time, or with AOF enabled. However, this setup must be handled with care, since a restarting master will start with an empty dataset: if the replica tries to sync with it, the replica will be emptied as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='## Redis 主从复制原理\\n\\nRedis 主从复制基于 **leader-follower（主从）模式**，通过三个核心机制工作：\\n\\n### 1. 正常同步\\n当主从连接正常时，master 持续向 replica 发送命令流，复制所有数据集变更（客户端写入、键过期/淘汰等）。\\n\\n### 2. 部分重同步（Partial Resync）\\n当主从连接断开后重连，replica 尝试只获取断线期间错过的命令流部分。\\n\\n### 3. 全量重同步（Full Resync）\\n当部分重同步不可行时（backlog 不足或 replication ID 不匹配），执行完整数据集传输。\\n\\n---\\n\\n## PSYNC 工作机制\\n\\n### 核心概念\\n每个 Redis master 维护两个关键标识：\\n- **Replication ID**：标记数据集历史的伪随机字符串\\n- **Replication Offset**：每产生一字节复制流就递增的偏移量\\n\\n这两个值的组合 `(Replication ID, offset)` 唯一标识 master 数据集的某个精确版本。\\n\\n### PSYNC 流程\\n\\n**1.

Fork Operations (RDB/AOF)**\n- Problem: Background saves require forking, which copies page tables (e.g., 24GB instance = 48MB page table)\n- Fix:\n  - Use modern HVM instances on EC2\n  - Avoid Xen-based VMs (can be 10-100x slower)\n  - Disable transparent huge pages\n\n**3. Transparent Huge Pages**\n- Problem: Causes copy-on-write of entire process memory after fork\n- Fix:\n```bash\necho never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\n```\n\n**4. Memory Swapping**\n- Diagnosis:\n```bash\n# Check swap usage\nredis-cli info | grep process_id\ncat /proc/<pid>/smaps | grep 'Swap:'\n\n# Monitor swap activity\nvmstat 1  # Watch 'si' and 'so' columns\n```\n- Fix: Add more RAM or reduce memory pressure\n\n**5. AOF Disk I/O**\n- Problem: `fsync()` calls can block for milliseconds to seconds\n- Configuration options (ordered by latency):\n  - `appendfsync always` - Very slow, fsync on every write\n  - `appendfsync everysec` - Good compromise (recommended)\n  - `appendfsync everysec` + `no-appendfsync-on-rewrite yes` - Lower disk pressure\n  - `appendfsync no` - Kernel handles fsyncing\n  - RDB only - Various tradeoffs based on save triggers\n\n**Debug AOF latency:**\n```bash\nsudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\n```\n\n**6. Key Expiration**\n- Problem: If >25% of sampled keys expire in the same second, Redis loops to clean them\n- Fix: Avoid using `EXPIREAT` with the same timestamp for many keys\n\n**7. Network Latency**\n- Optimizations:\n  - Use Unix domain sockets if client and server are co-located\n  - Keep connections long-lived (don't connect/disconnect repeatedly)\n  - Use pipelining to reduce roundtrips\n  - Use aggregated commands (`MSET`/`MGET`)\n  - Consider Lua scripting for complex multi-command operations\n\n### Advanced Debugging\n\n**Enable Software Watchdog (last resort):**\n```bash\nCONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\n```\nThis logs stack traces when Redis blocks for >500ms. Disable after debugging:\n```bash\nCONFIG SET watchdog-period 0\n```\n\n### Persistence vs Latency Tradeoffs\n\nFrom safest to fastest:\n1. AOF + fsync always (slowest)\n2. AOF + fsync every second\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite\n4. AOF + fsync never\n5. RDB only (fastest, configurable)\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency.md]\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency-monitor.md]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/design-review.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency-monitor.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency.md"], "contexts_count": 4, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RDB", "AOF", "replica", "latency", "slow", "monitor", "memory", "optimization", "debug", "MEMORY", "MULTI", "Lua", "script"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/design-review.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency-monitor.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "ef1eb34c-629e-4d6d-8a08-fcf12a43cf30", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "f19a8676-efb1-4f19-a7ae-54ea308f3686", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about diagnosing and fixing Redis latency spikes.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_Oj2dPMGa1vc46stMlXhAwN', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'latency'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_BlecHpEWOOdP1T2jB3yr21', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis latency spikes diagnosis troubleshooting performance', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_Oj2dPMGa1vc46stMlXhAwN', content='Found 2 files\\ndocs/design-review.md\\ndocs/eval-review.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_BlecHpEWOOdP1T2jB3yr21', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7972,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency-monitor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis latency monitoring\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis is often used for demanding use cases, where it\\\\\\\\nserves a large number of queries per second per instance, but also has strict latency requirements for the average response\\\\\\\\ntime and the worst-case latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile Redis is an in-memory system, it deals with the operating system in\\\\\\\\ndifferent ways, for example, in the context of persisting to disk.\\\\\\\\nMoreover Redis implements a rich set of commands.

Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for. However\\\\\\\\nthere is not just a single swap field since the smaps file contains the\\\\\\\\ndifferent memory maps of our Redis process (The memory layout of a process\\\\\\\\nis more complex than a simple linear array of pages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince we are interested in all the memory swapped by our process the first thing\\\\\\\\nto do is to grep for the Swap field across all the file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | grep \\'Swap:\\'\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf everything is 0 kB, or if there are sporadic 4k entries, everything is\\\\\\\\nperfectly normal.

If this is the case with your\\\\\\\\nRedis instance you can further verify it using the **vmstat** command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ vmstat 1\\\\\\\\n    procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----\\\\\\\\n     r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697932 147180 1406456    0    0     2     2    2    0  4  4 91  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697428 147180 1406580    0    0     0     0 19088 16104  9  6 84  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697296 147180 1406616    0    0     0    28 18936 16193  7  6 87  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697048 147180 1406640    0    0     0     0 18613 15987  6  6 88  0\\\\\\\\n     2  0   3980 696924 147180 1406656    0    0     0     0 18744 16299  6  5 88  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697048 147180 1406688    0    0     0     4 18520 15974  6  6 88  0\\\\\\\\n    ^C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe interesting part of the output for our needs are the two columns **si**\\\\\\\\nand **so**, that counts the amount of memory swapped from/to the swap file.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server.

Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server.

Slow Commands (O(N) operations)**\\n- Problem: Commands like `KEYS`, `SORT`, `LREM`, `SUNION` on large datasets block the single-threaded server\\n- Fix: \\n  - Never use `KEYS` in production - use `SCAN`, `SSCAN`, `HSCAN`, `ZSCAN` instead\\n  - Run slow queries on replicas\\n  - Check algorithmic complexity before using unfamiliar commands\\n\\n**2. Fork Operations (RDB/AOF)**\\n- Problem: Background saves require forking, which copies page tables (e.g., 24GB instance = 48MB page table)\\n- Fix:\\n  - Use modern HVM instances on EC2\\n  - Avoid Xen-based VMs (can be 10-100x slower)\\n  - Disable transparent huge pages\\n\\n**3. Transparent Huge Pages**\\n- Problem: Causes copy-on-write of entire process memory after fork\\n- Fix:\\n```bash\\necho never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\n```\\n\\n**4. Memory Swapping**\\n- Diagnosis:\\n```bash\\n# Check swap usage\\nredis-cli info | grep process_id\\ncat /proc/<pid>/smaps | grep 'Swap:'\\n\\n# Monitor swap activity\\nvmstat 1  # Watch 'si' and 'so' columns\\n```\\n- Fix: Add more RAM or reduce memory pressure\\n\\n**5. AOF Disk I/O**\\n- Problem: `fsync()` calls can block for milliseconds to seconds\\n- Configuration options (ordered by latency):\\n  - `appendfsync always` - Very slow, fsync on every write\\n  - `appendfsync everysec` - Good compromise (recommended)\\n  - `appendfsync everysec` + `no-appendfsync-on-rewrite yes` - Lower disk pressure\\n  - `appendfsync no` - Kernel handles fsyncing\\n  - RDB only - Various tradeoffs based on save triggers\\n\\n**Debug AOF latency:**\\n```bash\\nsudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\n```\\n\\n**6. Key Expiration**\\n- Problem: If >25% of sampled keys expire in the same second, Redis loops to clean them\\n- Fix: Avoid using `EXPIREAT` with the same timestamp for many keys\\n\\n**7. Network Latency**\\n- Optimizations:\\n  - Use Unix domain sockets if client and server are co-located\\n  - Keep connections long-lived (don't connect/disconnect repeatedly)\\n  - Use pipelining to reduce roundtrips\\n  - Use aggregated commands (`MSET`/`MGET`)\\n  - Consider Lua scripting for complex multi-command operations\\n\\n### Advanced Debugging\\n\\n**Enable Software Watchdog (last resort):**\\n```bash\\nCONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\n```\\nThis logs stack traces when Redis blocks for >500ms.

Slow Commands (O(N) operations)**\n- Problem: Commands like `KEYS`, `SORT`, `LREM`, `SUNION` on large datasets block the single-threaded server\n- Fix: \n  - Never use `KEYS` in production - use `SCAN`, `SSCAN`, `HSCAN`, `ZSCAN` instead\n  - Run slow queries on replicas\n  - Check algorithmic complexity before using unfamiliar commands\n\n**2. Fork Operations (RDB/AOF)**\n- Problem: Background saves require forking, which copies page tables (e.g., 24GB instance = 48MB page table)\n- Fix:\n  - Use modern HVM instances on EC2\n  - Avoid Xen-based VMs (can be 10-100x slower)\n  - Disable transparent huge pages\n\n**3. Transparent Huge Pages**\n- Problem: Causes copy-on-write of entire process memory after fork\n- Fix:\n```bash\necho never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\n```\n\n**4. Memory Swapping**\n- Diagnosis:\n```bash\n# Check swap usage\nredis-cli info | grep process_id\ncat /proc/<pid>/smaps | grep 'Swap:'\n\n# Monitor swap activity\nvmstat 1  # Watch 'si' and 'so' columns\n```\n- Fix: Add more RAM or reduce memory pressure\n\n**5. AOF Disk I/O**\n- Problem: `fsync()` calls can block for milliseconds to seconds\n- Configuration options (ordered by latency):\n  - `appendfsync always` - Very slow, fsync on every write\n  - `appendfsync everysec` - Good compromise (recommended)\n  - `appendfsync everysec` + `no-appendfsync-on-rewrite yes` - Lower disk pressure\n  - `appendfsync no` - Kernel handles fsyncing\n  - RDB only - Various tradeoffs based on save triggers\n\n**Debug AOF latency:**\n```bash\nsudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\n```\n\n**6. Key Expiration**\n- Problem: If >25% of sampled keys expire in the same second, Redis loops to clean them\n- Fix: Avoid using `EXPIREAT` with the same timestamp for many keys\n\n**7. Network Latency**\n- Optimizations:\n  - Use Unix domain sockets if client and server are co-located\n  - Keep connections long-lived (don't connect/disconnect repeatedly)\n  - Use pipelining to reduce roundtrips\n  - Use aggregated commands (`MSET`/`MGET`)\n  - Consider Lua scripting for complex multi-command operations\n\n### Advanced Debugging\n\n**Enable Software Watchdog (last resort):**\n```bash\nCONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\n```\nThis logs stack traces when Redis blocks for >500ms. Disable after debugging:\n```bash\nCONFIG SET watchdog-period 0\n```\n\n### Persistence vs Latency Tradeoffs\n\nFrom safest to fastest:\n1. AOF + fsync always (slowest)\n2. AOF + fsync every second\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite\n4. AOF + fsync never\n5. RDB only (fastest, configurable)\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency.md]\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency-monitor.md]", "session_id": "ef1eb34c-629e-4d6d-8a08-fcf12a43cf30", "num_turns": 5, "duration_ms": 379707, "total_cost_usd": 0.10418974999999998, "usage": {"input_tokens": 2522, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 5045, "cache_read_input_tokens": 63097, "output_tokens": 1140, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

Vector Sets 内存优化（针对向量数据）\n\n**量化策略**：\n- `Q8`（默认）：内存减少 4 倍，高召回率，快速且准确\n- `BIN`：内存减少 32 倍，最快，适合粗粒度搜索\n- `NOQUANT`：完整大小，最高精度，最慢\n\n**HNSW 图优化**：\n- 降低 `M` 参数以减少每个节点的连接数\n- 默认 M=16 时，每个节点平均有 `M * 2 + M * 0.33` 个指针\n- M=64 时单个节点仅链接就可能消耗约 1KB\n\n**维度降维**：\n- 使用 `REDUCE` 选项在 `VADD` 时应用随机投影\n- 例如：将 300 维向量降至 100 维，减少存储并提升速度\n\n**属性优化**：\n- 使用短的固定长度字符串作为标签\n- 保持 JSON 属性最小化和扁平化，如 `{\"year\":2020}` 而非嵌套数据\n\n[来源: redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md > Memory optimization]\n\n### 5. 内存分配理解\n- Redis 不总是在删除键后立即释放内存给 OS\n- 需要根据**峰值内存使用量**进行容量规划\n- 分配器会重用空闲内存块，RSS 可能保持稳定\n- 碎片率在峰值远大于当前使用量时不可靠\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Memory allocation]\n\n### 6. 写密集型应用注意事项\n- 在保存 RDB 或重写 AOF 时，Redis 可能使用高达 2 倍的正常内存\n- 额外内存与保存期间被写入修改的内存页数成正比\n- 需要相应地调整内存大小\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/admin.md]\n\n### 7. 诊断工具\n使用以下命令辅助故障排查：\n- `LATENCY DOCTOR`\n- `MEMORY DOCTOR`\n\n[来源:

Similarly sometimes Redis is used in order to\\\\\\\\ntake in memory another copy of a subset of the same data stored in the on-disk\\\\\\\\ndatabase. This may look similar to caching, but actually is a more advanced model\\\\\\\\nsince normally the Redis dataset is updated together with the on-disk DB dataset,\\\\\\\\nand not refreshed on cache misses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA good practice is to consider memory consumption when mapping your logical data model to the physical data model within Redis. These considerations include using specific data types, key patterns, and normalization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeyond data modeling, there is more info in the [Memory Optimization page]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has built-in protections allowing the users to set a max limit on memory\\\\\\\\nusage, using the `maxmemory` option in the configuration file to put a limit\\\\\\\\nto the memory Redis can use. If this limit is reached, Redis will start to reply\\\\\\\\nwith an error to write commands (but will continue to accept read-only\\\\\\\\ncommands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also configure Redis to evict keys when the max memory limit\\\\\\\\nis reached. See the [eviction policy docs]() for more information on this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShort answer: `echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` :)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now the long one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis background saving schema relies on the copy-on-write semantic of the `fork` system call in\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems: Redis forks (creates a child process) that is an\\\\\\\\nexact copy of the parent. The child process dumps the DB on disk and finally\\\\\\\\nexits. In theory the child should use as much memory as the parent being a\\\\\\\\ncopy, but actually thanks to the copy-on-write semantic implemented by most\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems the parent and child process will _share_ the common\\\\\\\\nmemory pages. A page will be duplicated only when it changes in the child or in\\\\\\\\nthe parent. Since in theory all the pages may change while the child process is\\\\\\\\nsaving, Linux can\\'t tell in advance how much memory the child will take, so if\\\\\\\\nthe `overcommit_memory` setting is set to zero the fork will fail unless there is\\\\\\\\nas much free RAM as required to really duplicate all the parent memory pages.\\\\\\\\nIf you have a Redis dataset of 3 GB and just 2 GB of free\\\\\\\\nmemory it will fail.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSetting `overcommit_memory` to 1 tells Linux to relax and perform the fork in a\\\\\\\\nmore optimistic allocation fashion, and this is indeed what you want for Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can refer to the [proc(5)][proc5] man page for explanations of the\\\\\\\\navailable values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[proc5]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, the Redis background saving process is always forked when the server is\\\\\\\\noutside of the execution of a command, so every command reported to be atomic\\\\\\\\nin RAM is also atomic from the point of view of the disk snapshot.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.2411,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a0527f7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a0527f7-033\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisstack 7.2 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Stack 7.2.0-v0 (August 2023) > Headlines:\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis server 7.2 introduces significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets, several improvements, including encoding improvements for sets and lists, stream consumer group improvements, and improved durability.\\\\\\\\nSearch and Query brings the frequently asked Geo polygons queries for basic shapes and improved query performance on sorting in different scenarios. \\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands: [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) and [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) for more efficient data manipulation.\\\\\\\\nPreview of triggers and functions that allows developers to run JavaScript functions inside the Redis process.\\\\\\\\nLastly, 7.2 adds the option to use the new protocol [RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) improving the response format for all commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis server**:\\\\\\\\nRedis server 7.2 brings performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack.

Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.7012,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0904b4cf\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0904b4cf-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/redis-in-ai.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis In Ai\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Use Cases in GenAI Apps\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis enables high-performance, scalable, and reliable data management, making it a key component for GenAI apps, chatbots, and AI agents.

With vector search, Redis retrieves similar questions and relevant data, lowering LLM inference costs and latency.

This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory error for write commands if and when it reaches the \\\\\\\\nlimit - which in turn may result in errors in the application but will not render the \\\\\\\\nwhole machine dead because of memory starvation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6005,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"String objects APIs > `RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation`\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"void RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation(RedisModuleString *str);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 7.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTrim possible excess memory allocated for a `RedisModuleString`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes a `RedisModuleString` may have more memory allocated for\\\\\\\\nit than required, typically for argv arguments that were constructed\\\\\\\\nfrom network buffers.

Graceful shutdown signals:\n- Redis doesn't exit immediately when receiving these signals\n- Instead, it schedules a shutdown similar to the `SHUTDOWN` command\n- The shutdown starts as soon as the current command completes (with max 0.1s delay)\n- If blocked by a long-running Lua script, use `SCRIPT KILL` first\n\n## Graceful Shutdown Process\n\nWhen Redis receives SIGTERM/SIGINT, it performs these actions in order:\n\n1. **Replica synchronization** (Redis 7.0+):\n   -

When the server receives this signal,\\\\\\\\nit does not immediately exit. Instead, it schedules\\\\\\\\na shutdown similar to the one performed by the [`SHUTDOWN`](/commands/shutdown) command. The scheduled shutdown starts as soon as possible, specifically as long as the\\\\\\\\ncurrent command in execution terminates (if any), with a possible additional\\\\\\\\ndelay of 0.1 seconds or less.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the server is blocked by a long-running Lua script,\\\\\\\\nkill the script with [`SCRIPT KILL`](/commands/script-kill) if possible. The scheduled shutdown will\\\\\\\\nrun just after the script is killed or terminates spontaneously.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis shutdown process includes the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If there are any replicas lagging behind in replication:\\\\\\\\n  * Pause clients attempting to write with [`CLIENT PAUSE`](/commands/client-pause) and the `WRITE` option.\\\\\\\\n  * Wait up to the configured `shutdown-timeout` (default 10 seconds) for replicas to catch up with the master\\'s replication offset.\\\\\\\\n* If a background child is saving the RDB file or performing an AOF rewrite, the child process is killed.\\\\\\\\n* If the AOF is active, Redis calls the `fsync` system call on the AOF file descriptor to flush the buffers on disk.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis is configured to persist on disk using RDB files, a synchronous (blocking) save is performed. Since the save is synchronous, it doesn\\'t use any additional memory.\\\\\\\\n* If the server is daemonized, the PID file is removed.\\\\\\\\n* If the Unix domain socket is enabled, it gets removed.\\\\\\\\n* The server exits with an exit code of zero.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIF the RDB file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails, and the server continues to run in order to ensure no data loss.\\\\\\\\nLikewise, if the user just turned on AOF, and the server triggered the first AOF rewrite in order to create the initial AOF file but this file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails and the server continues to run.\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.6.11, no further attempt to shut down will be made unless a new `SIGTERM` is received or the [`SHUTDOWN`](/commands/shutdown) command is issued.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 7.0, the server waits for lagging replicas up to a configurable `shutdown-timeout`, 10 seconds by default, before shutting down.\\\\\\\\nThis provides a best effort to minimize the risk of data loss in a situation where no save points are configured and AOF is deactivated.\\\\\\\\nBefore version 7.0, shutting down a heavily loaded master node in a diskless setup was more likely to result in data loss.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risk of data loss in such setups, trigger a manual [`FAILOVER`](/commands/failover) (or [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)) to demote the master to a replica and promote one of the replicas to a new master before shutting down a master node.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4889,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis signal handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Kill the RDB file without errors\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The following signals are handled as a Redis crash:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* SIGSEGV\\\\\\\\n* SIGBUS\\\\\\\\n* SIGFPE\\\\\\\\n* SIGILL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce one of these signals is trapped, Redis stops any current operation and performs the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Adds a bug report to the log file.

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.4393,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Appendix: Why are busy loops slow even on the loopback interface?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In the following benchmark we\\'ll use the Redis Ruby client, supporting pipelining, to test the speed improvement due to pipelining:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```ruby\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'rubygems\\'\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'redis\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef bench(descr)\\\\\\\\n  start = Time.now\\\\\\\\n  yield\\\\\\\\n  puts \\\\\\\\\\\\\"#{descr} #{Time.now -

The wise thing is just avoiding\\\\\\\\nbenchmarking in this way.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2133,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"It\\'s not just a matter of RTT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Request/Response server can be implemented so that it is able to process new requests even if the client hasn\\'t already read the old responses.\\\\\\\\nThis way it is possible to send *multiple commands* to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use for many decades.\\\\\\\\nFor instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has supported pipelining since its early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.\\\\\\\\nThis is an example using the raw netcat utility:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash \\\\\\\\n$ (printf \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; sleep 1) | nc localhost 6379\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time we don\\'t pay the cost of RTT for every call, but just once for the three commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be explicit, with pipelining the order of operations of our very first example will be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the client sends commands using pipelining, the server will be forced to queue the replies, using memory. So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.087,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"fc275d19\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"fc275d19-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/benchmarks/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis benchmark\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Other Redis benchmarking tools\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"It is critically important that Redis performance is retained or improved seamlessly on every released version. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo assess it, we\\'ve conducted benchmarks on the released versions of Redis (starting on v2.6.0) using `redis-benchmark` on a series of command types over a standalone redis-server, repeating the same benchmark multiple times, ensuring its statistical significance, and measuring the run-to-run variance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe used hardware platform was a stable bare-metal HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 Server, with one Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6230 CPU @ 2.10GHz, disabling Intel HT Technology, disabling CPU Frequency scaling, with all configurable BIOS and CPU system settings set to performance. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe box was running Ubuntu 18.04 Linux release 4.15.0-123, and Redis was compiled with gcc 7.5.0.\\\\\\\\nThe used benchmark client (`redis-benchmark`) was kept stable across all tests, with version `redis-benchmark 6.2.0 (git:445aa844)`.\\\\\\\\nBoth the redis-server and redis-benchmark processes were pinned to specific physical cores.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following benchmark options were used across tests:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The tests were done with 50 simultaneous clients performing 5 million requests.\\\\\\\\n* Tests were executed using the loopback interface.\\\\\\\\n* Tests were executed without pipelining.\\\\\\\\n* The used payload size was 256 Bytes.\\\\\\\\n* For each redis-benchmark process, 2 threads were used to ensure that the benchmark client was not the bottleneck.\\\\\\\\n* Strings, Hashes, Sets, and Sorted Sets data types were benchmarked.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow we present the obtained results, broken by data type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Strings performance over versions](./performance-strings.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Hashes performance over versions](./performance-hashes.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Sets performance over versions](./performance-sets.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Sorted sets performance over versions](./performance-sorted-sets.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are several third-party tools that can be used for benchmarking Redis.

Here's how they work:\n\n### Basic Mechanism\n\n1. **MULTI** - Starts a transaction. All subsequent commands are queued instead of executed immediately.\n2. **EXEC** - Executes all queued commands sequentially as a single atomic operation.\n3. **DISCARD** - Aborts the transaction and clears the command queue.\n\n### Example\n\n```redis\n> MULTI\nOK\n> INCR foo\nQUEUED\n> INCR bar\nQUEUED\n> EXEC\n1) (integer) 1\n2) (integer) 2\n```\n\n### Key Guarantees\n\n**Atomicity**: All commands in a transaction are serialized and executed sequentially. No other client's request can interrupt the execution - they run as a single isolated operation.\n\n**All-or-nothing queuing**: If EXEC is called, all operations are performed. If the connection is lost before EXEC, none of the operations are performed.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nRedis transactions handle errors differently than traditional databases:\n\n- **Syntax errors** (before EXEC): Detected during command queuing. Redis 2.6.5+ refuses to execute the transaction.\n- **Runtime errors** (after EXEC): Other commands still execute even if one fails. Redis does not support rollbacks.\n\nExample of runtime error:\n```redis\nMULTI\nSET a abc\nLPOP a          # Wrong operation for string type\nEXEC\n# Returns: +OK and -WRONGTYPE error\n# Both commands execute, one succeeds, one fails\n```\n\n### Optimistic Locking with WATCH\n\n**WATCH** provides check-and-set (CAS) behavior for transactions:\n\n```redis\nWATCH mykey\nval = GET mykey\nval = val + 1\nMULTI\nSET mykey $val\nEXEC\n```\n\nIf another client modifies `mykey` between WATCH and EXEC, the transaction aborts and EXEC returns null.

When using the\\\\\\\\n[append-only file]() Redis makes sure\\\\\\\\nto use a single write(2) syscall to write the transaction on disk.\\\\\\\\nHowever if the Redis server crashes or is killed by the system administrator\\\\\\\\nin some hard way it is possible that only a partial number of operations\\\\\\\\nare registered. Redis will detect this condition at restart, and will exit with an error.\\\\\\\\nUsing the `redis-check-aof` tool it is possible to fix the\\\\\\\\nappend only file that will remove the partial transaction so that the\\\\\\\\nserver can start again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStarting with version 2.2, Redis allows for an extra guarantee to the\\\\\\\\nabove two, in the form of optimistic locking in a way very similar to a\\\\\\\\ncheck-and-set (CAS) operation.\\\\\\\\nThis is documented [later](#cas) on this page.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis Transaction is entered using the [`MULTI`]() command. The command\\\\\\\\nalways replies with `OK`. At this point the user can issue multiple\\\\\\\\ncommands. Instead of executing these commands, Redis will queue\\\\\\\\nthem. All the commands are executed once [`EXEC`]() is called.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalling [`DISCARD`]() instead will flush the transaction queue and will exit\\\\\\\\nthe transaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following example increments keys `foo` and `bar` atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> MULTI\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> INCR foo\\\\\\\\nQUEUED\\\\\\\\n> INCR bar\\\\\\\\nQUEUED\\\\\\\\n> EXEC\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs is clear from the session above, [`EXEC`]() returns an\\\\\\\\narray of replies, where every element is the reply of a single command\\\\\\\\nin the transaction, in the same order the commands were issued.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a Redis connection is in the context of a [`MULTI`]() request,\\\\\\\\nall commands will reply with the string `QUEUED` (sent as a Status Reply\\\\\\\\nfrom the point of view of the Redis protocol).

Otherwise, if the client elected to proceed with the transaction\\\\\\\\nthe [`EXEC`]() command would execute all commands queued successfully regardless of previous errors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nErrors happening *after* [`EXEC`]() instead are not handled in a special way:\\\\\\\\nall the other commands will be executed even if some command fails during the transaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is more clear on the protocol level. In the following example one\\\\\\\\ncommand will fail when executed even if the syntax is right:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\\\\\\\\nConnected to localhost.\\\\\\\\nEscape character is \\'^]\\'.\\\\\\\\nMULTI\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\nSET a abc\\\\\\\\n+QUEUED\\\\\\\\nLPOP a\\\\\\\\n+QUEUED\\\\\\\\nEXEC\\\\\\\\n*2\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n-WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`EXEC`]() returned two-element [bulk string reply]() where one is an `OK` code and\\\\\\\\nthe other an error reply. It\\'s up to the client library to find a\\\\\\\\nsensible way to provide the error to the user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s important to note that\\\\\\\\n**even when a command fails, all the other commands in the queue are processed** – Redis will _not_ stop the\\\\\\\\nprocessing of commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother example, again using the wire protocol with `telnet`, shows how\\\\\\\\nsyntax errors are reported ASAP instead:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nMULTI\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\nINCR a b c\\\\\\\\n-ERR wrong number of arguments for \\'incr\\' command\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time due to the syntax error the bad [`INCR`]() command is not queued\\\\\\\\nat all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis does not support rollbacks of transactions since supporting rollbacks\\\\\\\\nwould have a significant impact on the simplicity and performance of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`DISCARD`]() can be used in order to abort a transaction. In this case, no\\\\\\\\ncommands are executed and the state of the connection is restored to\\\\\\\\nnormal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> SET foo 1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> MULTI\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> INCR foo\\\\\\\\nQUEUED\\\\\\\\n> DISCARD\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> GET foo\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"cas\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.0203,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Transactions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Optimistic locking using check-and-set\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"[`WATCH`]() is used to provide a check-and-set (CAS) behavior to Redis\\\\\\\\ntransactions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`WATCH`]()ed keys are monitored in order to detect changes against them. If\\\\\\\\nat least one watched key is modified before the [`EXEC`]() command, the\\\\\\\\nwhole transaction aborts, and [`EXEC`]() returns a [Null reply]() to notify that\\\\\\\\nthe transaction failed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, imagine we have the need to atomically increment the value\\\\\\\\nof a key by 1 (let\\'s suppose Redis doesn\\'t have [`INCR`]()).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first try may be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nval = GET mykey\\\\\\\\nval = val + 1\\\\\\\\nSET mykey $val\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis will work reliably only if we have a single client performing the\\\\\\\\noperation in a given time. If multiple clients try to increment the key\\\\\\\\nat about the same time there will be a race condition. For instance,\\\\\\\\nclient A and B will read the old value, for instance, 10. The value will\\\\\\\\nbe incremented to 11 by both the clients, and finally [`SET`]() as the value\\\\\\\\nof the key. So the final value will be 11 instead of 12.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThanks to [`WATCH`]() we are able to model the problem very well:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nWATCH mykey\\\\\\\\nval = GET mykey\\\\\\\\nval = val + 1\\\\\\\\nMULTI\\\\\\\\nSET mykey $val\\\\\\\\nEXEC\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the above code, if there are race conditions and another client\\\\\\\\nmodifies the result of `val` in the time between our call to [`WATCH`]() and\\\\\\\\nour call to [`EXEC`](), the transaction will fail.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe just have to repeat the operation hoping this time we\\'ll not get a\\\\\\\\nnew race.

Default Mode (Server-Tracked)**\n- Server remembers which keys each client accessed\n- Sends invalidation messages only for keys the client might have cached\n- Costs memory on the server side but is more efficient with invalidation messages\n\n**2.

However many client implementations may prefer to implement client-side caching using two separated connections: one for data, and one for invalidation messages. For this reason when a client enables tracking, it can specify to redirect the invalidation messages to another connection by specifying the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"client ID\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of a different connection. Many data connections can redirect invalidation messages to the same connection, this is useful for clients implementing connection pooling. The two connections model is the only one that is also supported for RESP2 (which lacks the ability to multiplex different kind of information in the same connection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of a complete session using the Redis protocol in the old RESP2 mode involving the following steps: enabling tracking redirecting to another connection, asking for a key, and getting an invalidation message once the key gets modified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo start, the client opens a first connection that will be used for invalidations, requests the connection ID, and subscribes via Pub/Sub to the special channel that is used to get invalidation messages when in RESP2 modes (remember that RESP2 is the usual Redis protocol, and not the more advanced protocol that you can use, optionally, with Redis 6 using the [`HELLO`]() command):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT ID\\\\\\\\n:4\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE __redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$9\\\\\\\\nsubscribe\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow we can enable tracking from the data connection:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 2 -- data connection)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 4\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGET foo\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nbar\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client may decide to cache `\\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" => \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` in the local memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA different client will now modify the value of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" key:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Some other unrelated connection)\\\\\\\\nSET foo bar\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result, the invalidations connection will receive a message that invalidates the specified key.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$7\\\\\\\\nmessage\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*1\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nfoo\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe client will check if there are cached keys in this caching slot, and will evict the information that is no longer valid.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the third element of the Pub/Sub message is not a single key but\\\\\\\\nis a Redis array with just a single element. Since we send an array, if there\\\\\\\\nare groups of keys to invalidate, we can do that in a single message.\\\\\\\\nIn case of a flush ([`FLUSHALL`]() or [`FLUSHDB`]()), a `null` message will be sent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA very important thing to understand about client-side caching used with\\\\\\\\nRESP2 and a Pub/Sub connection in order to read the invalidation messages,\\\\\\\\nis that using Pub/Sub is entirely a trick **in order to reuse old client\\\\\\\\nimplementations**, but actually the message is not really sent to a channel\\\\\\\\nand received by all the clients subscribed to it. Only the connection we\\\\\\\\nspecified in the `REDIRECT` argument of the [`CLIENT`]() command will actually\\\\\\\\nreceive the Pub/Sub message, making the feature a lot more scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen RESP3 is used instead, invalidation messages are sent (either in the\\\\\\\\nsame connection, or in the secondary connection when redirection is used)\\\\\\\\nas `push` messages (read the RESP3 specification for more information).\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7493,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis implementation of client-side caching\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis client-side caching support is called _Tracking_, and has two modes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* In the default mode, the server remembers what keys a given client accessed, and sends invalidation messages when the same keys are modified. This costs memory in the server side, but sends invalidation messages only for the set of keys that the client might have in memory.\\\\\\\\n* In the _broadcasting_ mode, the server does not attempt to remember what keys a given client accessed, so this mode costs no memory at all in the server side. Instead clients subscribe to key prefixes such as `object:` or `user:`, and receive a notification message every time a key matching a subscribed prefix is touched.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo recap, for now let\\'s forget for a moment about the broadcasting mode, to\\\\\\\\nfocus on the first mode. We\\'ll describe broadcasting in more detail later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Clients can enable tracking if they want. Connections start without tracking enabled.\\\\\\\\n2. When tracking is enabled, the server remembers what keys each client requested during the connection lifetime (by sending read commands about such keys).\\\\\\\\n3. When a key is modified by some client, or is evicted because it has an associated expire time, or evicted because of a _maxmemory_ policy, all the clients with tracking enabled that may have the key cached, are notified with an _invalidation message_.\\\\\\\\n4. When clients receive invalidation messages, they are required to remove the corresponding keys, in order to avoid serving stale data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of the protocol:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: CLIENT TRACKING ON\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: GET foo\\\\\\\\n* (The server remembers that Client 1 may have the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" cached)\\\\\\\\n* (Client 1 may remember the value of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" inside its local memory)\\\\\\\\n* Client 2 `->` Server: SET foo SomeOtherValue\\\\\\\\n* Server `->` Client 1: INVALIDATE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis looks great superficially, but if you imagine 10k connected clients all\\\\\\\\nasking for millions of keys over long living connection, the server ends up\\\\\\\\nstoring too much information. For this reason Redis uses two key ideas in\\\\\\\\norder to limit the amount of memory used server-side and the CPU cost of\\\\\\\\nhandling the data structures implementing the feature:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The server remembers the list of clients that may have cached a given key in a single global table. This table is called the **Invalidation Table**. The invalidation table can contain a maximum number of entries. If a new key is inserted, the server may evict an older entry by pretending that such key was modified (even if it was not), and sending an invalidation message to the clients. Doing so, it can reclaim the memory used for this key, even if this will force the clients having a local copy of the key to evict it.\\\\\\\\n* Inside the invalidation table we don\\'t really need to store pointers to clients\\' structures, that would force a garbage collection procedure when the client disconnects: instead what we do is just store client IDs (each Redis client has a unique numerical ID). If a client disconnects, the information will be incrementally garbage collected as caching slots are invalidated.\\\\\\\\n* There is a single keys namespace, not divided by database numbers. So if a client is caching the key `foo` in database 2, and some other client changes the value of the key `foo` in database 3, an invalidation message will still be sent. This way we can ignore database numbers reducing both the memory usage and the implementation complexity.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7306,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"The NOLOOP option\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"So far we described the first client-side caching model that Redis implements.\\\\\\\\nThere is another one, called broadcasting, that sees the problem from the\\\\\\\\npoint of view of a different tradeoff, does not consume any memory on the\\\\\\\\nserver side, but instead sends more invalidation messages to clients.\\\\\\\\nIn this mode we have the following main behaviors:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients enable client-side caching using the `BCAST` option, specifying one or more prefixes using the `PREFIX` option. For instance: `CLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 10 BCAST PREFIX object: PREFIX user:`. If no prefix is specified at all, the prefix is assumed to be the empty string, so the client will receive invalidation messages for every key that gets modified. Instead if one or more prefixes are used, only keys matching one of the specified prefixes will be sent in the invalidation messages.\\\\\\\\n* The server does not store anything in the invalidation table. Instead it uses a different **Prefixes Table**, where each prefix is associated to a list of clients.\\\\\\\\n* No two prefixes can track overlapping parts of the keyspace. For instance, having the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foob\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would not be allowed, since they would both trigger an invalidation for the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foobar\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, just using the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is sufficient.\\\\\\\\n* Every time a key matching any of the prefixes is modified, all the clients subscribed to that prefix, will receive the invalidation message.\\\\\\\\n* The server will consume CPU proportional to the number of registered prefixes. If you have just a few, it is hard to see any difference. With a big number of prefixes the CPU cost can become quite large.\\\\\\\\n* In this mode the server can perform the optimization of creating a single reply for all the clients subscribed to a given prefix, and send the same reply to all. This helps to lower the CPU usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default client-side tracking will send invalidation messages to the\\\\\\\\nclient that modified the key. Sometimes clients want this, since they\\\\\\\\nimplement very basic logic that does not involve automatically caching\\\\\\\\nwrites locally. However, more advanced clients may want to cache even the\\\\\\\\nwrites they are doing in the local in-memory table. In such case receiving\\\\\\\\nan invalidation message immediately after the write is a problem, since it\\\\\\\\nwill force the client to evict the value it just cached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this case it is possible to use the `NOLOOP` option: it works both\\\\\\\\nin normal and broadcasting mode. Using this option, clients are able to\\\\\\\\ntell the server they don\\'t want to receive invalidation messages for keys\\\\\\\\nthat they modified.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2037,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Other hints for implementing client libraries\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When implementing client-side caching redirecting the invalidation messages\\\\\\\\nto a different connection, you should be aware that there is a possible\\\\\\\\nrace condition.

So we\\'ll keep serving a stale version of the\\\\\\\\nfoo key. To avoid this problem, it is a good idea to populate the cache\\\\\\\\nwhen we send the command with a placeholder:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: set the local copy of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"caching-in-progress\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    [D] client-> server: GET foo.\\\\\\\\n    [I] server -> client: Invalidate foo (somebody else touched it)\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: delete \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the local cache.\\\\\\\\n    [D] server -> client: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the reply of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GET foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: don\\'t set \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\" since the entry for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is missing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSuch a race condition is not possible when using a single connection for both\\\\\\\\ndata and invalidation messages, since the order of the messages is always known\\\\\\\\nin that case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, if we lost the connection with the socket we use in order to\\\\\\\\nget the invalidation messages, we may end with stale data. In order to avoid\\\\\\\\nthis problem, we need to do the following things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure that if the connection is lost, the local cache is flushed.\\\\\\\\n2. Both when using RESP2 with Pub/Sub, or RESP3, ping the invalidation channel periodically (you can send PING commands even when the connection is in Pub/Sub mode!). If the connection looks broken and we are not able to receive ping backs, after a maximum amount of time, close the connection and flush the cache.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients may want to run internal statistics about the number of times\\\\\\\\na given cached key was actually served in a request, to understand in the\\\\\\\\nfuture what is good to cache. In general:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that change continuously.\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that are requested very rarely.\\\\\\\\n* We want to cache keys that are requested often and change at a reasonable rate. For an example of key not changing at a reasonable rate, think of a global counter that is continuously [`INCR`]()emented.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever simpler clients may just evict data using some random sampling just\\\\\\\\nremembering the last time a given cached value was served, trying to evict\\\\\\\\nkeys that were not served recently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Handling TTLs: make sure you also request the key TTL and set the TTL in the local cache if you want to support caching keys with a TTL.\\\\\\\\n* Putting a max TTL on every key is a good idea, even if it has no TTL. This protects against bugs or connection issues that would make the client have old data in the local copy.\\\\\\\\n* Limiting the amount of memory used by clients is absolutely needed.

When data arrives, only cache if entry still exists\n```\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md > The Redis implementation of client-side caching, Two connections mode, The NOLOOP option]", "session_id": "84813564-0da3-4f40-b583-c914f753be1f", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 92614, "total_cost_usd": 0.0571875, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1306, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2614, "cache_read_input_tokens": 32690, "output_tokens": 719, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}
{"test_id": "redis-ops-015", "category": "redis-ops", "type": "unknown", "source": "qdrant", "query": "How to use Redis Lua scripting with EVAL command?", "status": "passed", "elapsed_seconds": 105.06465196609497, "cost_usd": 0.05277775, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 1800, "answer": "Based on the knowledge base search, here's how to use Redis Lua scripting with the EVAL command:\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nThe `EVAL` command executes Lua scripts on the Redis server. Basic syntax:\n\n```\nEVAL \"script\" numkeys [key ...] [arg ...]\n```\n\n**Simple example:**\n```\n> EVAL \"return 'Hello, scripting!'\" 0\n\"Hello, scripting!\"\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n1. **Script source code** - The Lua script as a string\n2. **Number of keys** - Count of Redis key names that follow (starting from 3rd argument)\n3. **Keys and arguments** - Optional key names and additional arguments\n\n## Calling Redis Commands\n\nUse `redis.call()` or `redis.pcall()` to execute Redis commands from within your script:\n\n```\n> EVAL \"return redis.call('SET', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\" 1 foo bar\nOK\n```\n\nThis script:\n- Takes 1 key (`KEYS[1]` = \"foo\")\n- Takes 1 argument (`ARGV[1]` = \"bar\")\n- Executes `SET foo bar`\n\n**Difference between call methods:**\n- `redis.call()` - Errors are returned directly to the client\n- `redis.pcall()` - Errors are returned to the script for handling\n\n## Script Caching\n\nTo avoid sending the full script repeatedly, use caching:\n\n1. **Load script to cache:**\n```\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \"return 'I am a cached script'\"\n\"c664a3bf70bd1d45c4284ffebb65a6f2299bfc9f\"\n```\n\n2. **Execute cached script by SHA1:**\n```\nredis> EVALSHA c664a3bf70bd1d45c4284ffebb65a6f2299bfc9f 0\n\"I am a cached script\"\n```\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Atomic execution** - All operations in the script execute atomically\n- **Server-side execution** - Reduces network latency for complex operations\n- **Blocking semantics** - Server blocks during script execution\n- **Conditional logic** - Can perform conditional updates across multiple keys\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/eval-intro.md > Getting started, Script cache]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS.md", "docs/design-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md", "docs/design.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/eval-intro.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md", "docs/dual-repo-architecture.md", "docs/dual-layer-architecture.md", "docs/archive/COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md", "docs/e2e-testing.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "docs/archive/DUAL_LAYER_SUMMARY.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["latency", "MULTI", "EXEC", "caching", "EVAL", "Lua", "script"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS.md", "docs/design-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md", "docs/design.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/eval-intro.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md", "docs/dual-repo-architecture.md", "docs/dual-layer-architecture.md", "docs/archive/COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md", "docs/e2e-testing.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "docs/archive/DUAL_LAYER_SUMMARY.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "c9082350-c6d3-491b-8ae0-f854103a8658", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "d5940f40-f8d1-419f-91e2-0e1260a4ebb5", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Redis Lua scripting with the EVAL command.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_5nMIXK0Q6HhdCuxO5jn8TO', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Lua scripting EVAL command', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_mk9M6eVYNoEsX5Un3hChiL', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'EVAL'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_5nMIXK0Q6HhdCuxO5jn8TO', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.555,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/eval-intro.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scripting with Lua\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Getting started\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lets users upload and execute Lua scripts on the server.\\\\\\\\nScripts can employ programmatic control structures and use most of the [commands]() while executing to access the database.\\\\\\\\nBecause scripts execute in the server, reading and writing data from scripts is very efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis guarantees the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\nWhile executing the script, all server activities are blocked during its entire runtime.\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripting offers several properties that can be valuable in many cases.\\\\\\\\nThese include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Providing locality by executing logic where data lives. Data locality reduces overall latency and saves networking resources.\\\\\\\\n* Blocking semantics that ensure the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\n* Enabling the composition of simple capabilities that are either missing from Redis or are too niche to be a part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLua lets you run part of your application logic inside Redis.\\\\\\\\nSuch scripts can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine.\\\\\\\\nPresently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference]() page for complete documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough the server executes them, Eval scripts are regarded as a part of the client-side application, which is why they\\'re not named, versioned, or persisted.\\\\\\\\nSo all scripts may need to be reloaded by the application at any time if missing (after a server restart, fail-over to a replica, etc.).\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, [Redis Functions]() offer an alternative approach to programmability which allow the server itself to be extended with additional programmed logic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll start scripting with Redis by using the [`EVAL`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s our first example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello, scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, [`EVAL`]() takes two arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe first argument is a string that consists of the script\\'s Lua source code.\\\\\\\\nThe script doesn\\'t need to include any definitions of Lua function.\\\\\\\\nIt is just a Lua program that will run in the Redis engine\\'s context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second argument is the number of arguments that follow the script\\'s body, starting from the third argument, representing Redis key names.\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we used the value _0_ because we didn\\'t provide the script with any arguments, whether the names of keys or not.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.5281,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis functions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Prologue (or, what\\'s wrong with Eval Scripts?)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Functions is an API for managing code to be executed on the server. This feature, which became available in Redis 7, supersedes the use of [EVAL]() in prior versions of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior versions of Redis made scripting available only via the [`EVAL`]() command, which allows a Lua script to be sent for execution by the server.\\\\\\\\nThe core use cases for [Eval Scripts]() is executing part of your application logic inside Redis, efficiently and atomically.\\\\\\\\nSuch script can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing [`EVAL`]() requires that the application sends the entire script for execution every time.\\\\\\\\nBecause this results in network and script compilation overheads, Redis provides an optimization in the form of the [`EVALSHA`]() command. By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes to already-established and well-liked ephemeral scripts, Redis v7.0 introduces Redis Functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.7943,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/eval-intro.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scripting with Lua\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Script cache\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"It is possible to call Redis commands from a Lua script either via [`redis.call()`]() or [`redis.pcall()`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two are nearly identical.\\\\\\\\nBoth execute a Redis command along with its provided arguments, if these represent a well-formed command.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as generic as possible and provide customized execution via their arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA script is loaded to the server\\'s cache by calling the [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() command and providing its source code.\\\\\\\\nThe server doesn\\'t execute the script, but instead just compiles and loads it to the server\\'s cache.\\\\\\\\nOnce loaded, you can execute the cached script with the SHA1 digest returned from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of loading and then executing a cached script:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Immabe a cached script\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"c664a3bf70bd1d45c4284ffebb65a6f2299bfc9f\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nredis> EVALSHA c664a3bf70bd1d45c4284ffebb65a6f2299bfc9f 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Immabe a cached script\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.7262,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"81091cbf\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"81091cbf-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Debugging Lua scripts in Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Debugging clients\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The `redis.debug()` command is a powerful debugging facility that can be\\\\\\\\ncalled inside the Redis Lua script in order to log things into the debug\\\\\\\\nconsole:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nlua debugger> list\\\\\\\\n-> 1   local a = {1,2,3}\\\\\\\\n   2   local b = false\\\\\\\\n   3   redis.debug(a,b)\\\\\\\\nlua debugger> continue\\\\\\\\n<debug> line 3: {1;

Here's how it operates:\n\n## How Eviction Triggers\n\nWhen you run a command that adds data, Redis checks if memory usage exceeds `maxmemory`. If it does, Redis evicts keys according to your configured policy until memory drops back below the limit. This happens **before** the new command completes.\n\n## Why Keys Keep Growing\n\nIf your keys keep growing despite `maxmemory` being set, check:\n\n1. **Eviction policy**: If set to `noeviction` (default in some configs), Redis won't evict keys - it just returns errors on new writes\n2. **No eligible keys**: `volatile-*` policies only evict keys with TTL. If no keys have expiration set, they behave like `noeviction`\n3. **Replication/persistence buffers**: Memory used for replication and AOF buffers doesn't count toward `maxmemory`, so actual memory usage can exceed the limit\n\n## Available Eviction Policies\n\nConfigure with `maxmemory-policy`:\n\n**All keys policies** (evict any key):\n- `allkeys-lru`: Evict least recently used keys (good default)\n- `allkeys-lrm`: Evict least recently modified keys (Redis 8.6+, good for read-heavy workloads)\n- `allkeys-lfu`: Evict least frequently used keys\n- `allkeys-random`: Random eviction\n\n**Volatile policies** (only evict keys with TTL):\n- `volatile-lru`: LRU among keys with expiration\n- `volatile-lrm`: LRM among keys with expiration\n- `volatile-lfu`: LFU among keys with expiration\n- `volatile-ttl`: Evict keys with shortest TTL first\n- `volatile-random`: Random among keys with expiration\n\n**No eviction**:\n- `noeviction`: Return errors on writes when limit reached\n\n## Configuration Example\n\n```bash\n# In redis.conf\nmaxmemory 100mb\nmaxmemory-policy allkeys-lru\n\n# Or at runtime\nCONFIG SET maxmemory 100mb\nCONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru\n```\n\n## Recommendation\n\nFor cache use cases, use `allkeys-lru` - it evicts the least recently accessed keys across all keys, which works well with the Pareto principle (80/20 rule). If you're using `volatile-*` policies, make sure your keys actually have TTLs set, otherwise no eviction will occur.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md > Using the `maxmemory` configuration directive, Eviction policies]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["eviction", "maxmemory", "policy", "replica", "AOF", "KEYS", "memory"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "e58d03bd-e137-479f-8928-fd25fa58779a", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "c3858eea-2311-4673-abc3-47c01161e258", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis memory management and eviction policies.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_c0g0CI0juvng1YmUQY6DjL', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis maxmemory eviction policy keys growing memory management', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_8PdcnzbzjHHx6HkyYqjMWd', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'maxmemory|eviction'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_c0g0CI0juvng1YmUQY6DjL', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.8028,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Using the `maxmemory` configuration directive {#maxmem}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis is commonly used as a cache to speed up read accesses to a slower server\\\\\\\\nor database.

You can\\\\\\\\nset `maxmemory` with the [`redis.conf`](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.4.0/redis.conf)\\\\\\\\nfile at startup time.

This is a very common case according to the\\\\\\\\n    [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), so\\\\\\\\n    `allkeys-lru` is a good default option if you have no reason to prefer any others.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-lrm` when you want to preserve frequently read data but evict data\\\\\\\\n    that hasn\\'t been modified recently. This is useful for read-heavy workloads where\\\\\\\\n    you want to distinguish between data that\\'s actively being updated versus data\\\\\\\\n    that\\'s only being read.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-random` when you expect all keys to be accessed with roughly equal\\\\\\\\n    frequency. An example of this is when your app reads data items in a repeating cycle.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `volatile-ttl` if your code can estimate which keys are good candidates for eviction\\\\\\\\n    and assign short TTLs to them. Note also that if you make good use of\\\\\\\\n    key expiration, then you are less likely to run into the cache memory limit because keys\\\\\\\\n    will often expire before they need to be evicted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `volatile-lru`, `volatile-lrm`, and `volatile-random` policies are mainly useful when you want to use\\\\\\\\na single Redis instance for both caching and for a set of persistent keys. However,\\\\\\\\nyou should consider running two separate Redis instances in a case like this, if possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that setting an `expire` value for a key costs memory, so a\\\\\\\\npolicy like `allkeys-lru` is more memory efficient since it doesn\\'t need an\\\\\\\\n`expire` value to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.854,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"LRM eviction {#lrm-eviction}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with Redis 8.6, the Least Recently Modified (LRM) eviction policy is available.

Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties.

When you try to use them across keys on different nodes, you get a CROSSSLOT error.\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nRedis Cluster uses hash slots (16384 total) to distribute keys across nodes. Each key is assigned to a slot based on `CRC16(key) % 16384`. Commands like SORT and SUNION require all keys to be in the same slot because:\n\n- Redis Cluster doesn't support multi-key operations across different slots in cluster mode\n- These commands need atomic access to all keys simultaneously\n\n## Solution: Use Hash Tags\n\nForce your keys into the same hash slot using **hash tags**. Only the substring between `{}` brackets is hashed:\n\n```redis\n# These keys will be in the same slot:\nuser:{123}:list\nuser:{123}:set1  \nuser:{123}:set2\n\n# Now this works:\nSUNION user:{123}:set1 user:{123}:set2\nSORT user:{123}:list\n```\n\n## Command Behavior in Cluster Mode\n\nAccording to the multi-key operations reference:\n\n| Command | Cluster Behavior |\n|---------|------------------|\n| SUNION, SDIFF, SINTER | **single-slot** — all keys must be in same slot |\n| SORT | **single-slot** — key and BY/GET patterns must be in same slot |\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This limitation exists in both Redis Open Source (ROS) cluster and Redis Software (RS) with OSS cluster API enabled\n- During manual resharding, even single-slot operations may become temporarily unavailable\n- If you can't use hash tags, consider redesigning your data model to keep related keys together\n\n[来源:

but a different form of sharding\\\\\\\\nwhere every key is conceptually part of what we call a **hash slot**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute the hash\\\\\\\\nslot for a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo\\\\\\\\n16384.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,\\\\\\\\nso, for example, you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.\\\\\\\\n* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.\\\\\\\\n* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes it easy to add and remove cluster nodes. For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.9343,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Main properties and rationales of the design > Implemented subset\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster is a distributed implementation of Redis with the following goals in order of importance in the design:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* High performance and linear scalability up to 1000 nodes. There are no proxies, asynchronous replication is used, and no merge operations are performed on values.\\\\\\\\n* Acceptable degree of write safety: the system tries (in a best-effort way) to retain all the writes originating from clients connected with the majority of the master nodes. Usually there are small windows where acknowledged writes can be lost. Windows to lose acknowledged writes are larger when clients are in a minority partition.\\\\\\\\n* Availability: Redis Cluster is able to survive partitions where the majority of the master nodes are reachable and there is at least one reachable replica for every master node that is no longer reachable. Moreover using *replicas migration*, masters no longer replicated by any replica will receive one from a master which is covered by multiple replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat is described in this document is implemented in Redis 3.0 or greater.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster implements all the single key commands available in the\\\\\\\\nnon-distributed version of Redis.

Adding or removing a node is abstracted into the same\\\\\\\\noperation: moving a hash slot from one node to another. This means\\\\\\\\nthat the same basic mechanism can be used in order to rebalance the cluster, add\\\\\\\\nor remove nodes, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To add a new node to the cluster an empty node is added to the cluster and some set of hash slots are moved from existing nodes to the new node.\\\\\\\\n* To remove a node from the cluster the hash slots assigned to that node are moved to other existing nodes.\\\\\\\\n* To rebalance the cluster a given set of hash slots are moved between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe core of the implementation is the ability to move hash slots around.\\\\\\\\nFrom a practical point of view a hash slot is just a set of keys, so\\\\\\\\nwhat Redis Cluster really does during *resharding* is to move keys from\\\\\\\\nan instance to another instance. Moving a hash slot means moving all the keys\\\\\\\\nthat happen to hash into this hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo understand how this works we need to show the [`CLUSTER`](/commands/cluster) subcommands\\\\\\\\nthat are used to manipulate the slots translation table in a Redis Cluster node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following subcommands are available (among others not useful in this case):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-delslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-addslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-delslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot NODE node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot MIGRATING node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot IMPORTING node\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first four commands, `ADDSLOTS`, `DELSLOTS`, `ADDSLOTSRANGE` and `DELSLOTSRANGE`, are simply used to assign\\\\\\\\n(or remove) slots to a Redis node. Assigning a slot means to tell a given\\\\\\\\nmaster node that it will be in charge of storing and serving content for\\\\\\\\nthe specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the hash slots are assigned they will propagate across the cluster\\\\\\\\nusing the gossip protocol, as specified later in the\\\\\\\\n*configuration propagation* section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `ADDSLOTS` and `ADDSLOTSRANGE` commands are usually used when a new cluster is created\\\\\\\\nfrom scratch to assign each master node a subset of all the 16384 hash\\\\\\\\nslots available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `DELSLOTS`  and `DELSLOTSRANGE` are mainly used for manual modification of a cluster configuration\\\\\\\\nor for debugging tasks: in practice it is rarely used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `SETSLOT` subcommand is used to assign a slot to a specific node ID if\\\\\\\\nthe `SETSLOT <slot> NODE` form is used. Otherwise the slot can be set in the\\\\\\\\ntwo special states `MIGRATING` and `IMPORTING`. Those two special states\\\\\\\\nare used in order to migrate a hash slot from one node to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as MIGRATING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the key in question\\\\\\\\nexists, otherwise the query is forwarded using a `-ASK` redirection to the\\\\\\\\nnode that is target of the migration.\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as IMPORTING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the request is\\\\\\\\npreceded by an [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command. If the [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command was not given\\\\\\\\nby the client, the query is redirected to the real hash slot owner via\\\\\\\\na `-MOVED` redirection error, as would happen normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s make this clearer with an example of hash slot migration.\\\\\\\\nAssume that we have two Redis master nodes, called A and B.\\\\\\\\nWe want to move hash slot 8 from A to B, so we issue commands like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We send B: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 IMPORTING A\\\\\\\\n* We send A: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 MIGRATING B\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll the other nodes will continue to point clients to node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" every time\\\\\\\\nthey are queried with a key that belongs to hash slot 8, so what happens\\\\\\\\nis that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* All queries about existing keys are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* All queries about non-existing keys in A are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\", because \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will redirect clients to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis way we no longer create new keys in \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\nIn the meantime, `redis-cli` used during reshardings\\\\\\\\nand Redis Cluster configuration will migrate existing keys in\\\\\\\\nhash slot 8 from A to B.\\\\\\\\nThis is performed using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT slot count\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will return `count` keys in the specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\nFor keys returned, `redis-cli` sends node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) command, that\\\\\\\\nwill migrate the specified keys from A to B in an atomic way (both instances\\\\\\\\nare locked for the time (usually very small time) needed to migrate keys so\\\\\\\\nthere are no race conditions). This is how [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    MIGRATE target_host target_port \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\" target_database id timeout KEYS key1 key2 ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) will connect to the target instance, send a serialized version of\\\\\\\\nthe key, and once an OK code is received, the old key from its own dataset\\\\\\\\nwill be deleted. From the point of view of an external client a key exists\\\\\\\\neither in A or B at any given time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis Cluster there is no need to specify a database other than 0, but\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is a general command that can be used for other tasks not\\\\\\\\ninvolving Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is optimized to be as fast as possible even when moving complex\\\\\\\\nkeys such as long lists, but in Redis Cluster reconfiguring the\\\\\\\\ncluster where big keys are present is not considered a wise procedure if\\\\\\\\nthere are latency constraints in the application using the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the migration process is finally finished, the `SETSLOT <slot> NODE <node-id>` command is sent to the two nodes involved in the migration in order to\\\\\\\\nset the slots to their normal state again. The same command is usually\\\\\\\\nsent to all other nodes to avoid waiting for the natural\\\\\\\\npropagation of the new configuration across the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.3174,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > MOVED Redirection\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis client is free to send queries to every node in the cluster, including\\\\\\\\nreplica nodes.

This means that the last elected master dataset eventually replaces all the other replicas. There is always a window of time when it is possible to lose writes during partitions. However these windows are very different in the case of a client that is connected to the majority of masters, and a client that is connected to the minority of masters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster tries harder to retain writes that are performed by clients connected to the majority of masters, compared to writes performed in the minority side.\\\\\\\\nThe following are examples of scenarios that lead to loss of acknowledged\\\\\\\\nwrites received in the majority partitions during failures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A write may reach a master, but while the master may be able to reply to the client, the write may not be propagated to replicas via the asynchronous replication used between master and replica nodes. If the master dies without the write reaching the replicas, the write is lost forever if the master is unreachable for a long enough period that one of its replicas is promoted. This is usually hard to observe in the case of a total, sudden failure of a master node since masters try to reply to clients (with the acknowledge of the write) and replicas (propagating the write) at about the same time. However it is a real world failure mode.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Another theoretically possible failure mode where writes are lost is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A master is unreachable because of a partition.\\\\\\\\n* It gets failed over by one of its replicas.\\\\\\\\n* After some time it may be reachable again.\\\\\\\\n* A client with an out-of-date routing table may write to the old master before it is converted into a replica (of the new master) by the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second failure mode is unlikely to happen because master nodes unable to communicate with the majority of the other masters for enough time to be failed over will no longer accept writes, and when the partition is fixed writes are still refused for a small amount of time to allow other nodes to inform about configuration changes. This failure mode also requires that the client\\'s routing table has not yet been updated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWrites targeting the minority side of a partition have a larger window in which to get lost. For example, Redis Cluster loses a non-trivial number of writes on partitions where there is a minority of masters and at least one or more clients, since all the writes sent to the masters may potentially get lost if the masters are failed over in the majority side.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, for a master to be failed over it must be unreachable by the majority of masters for at least `NODE_TIMEOUT`, so if the partition is fixed before that time, no writes are lost. When the partition lasts for more than `NODE_TIMEOUT`, all the writes performed in the minority side up to that point may be lost. However the minority side of a Redis Cluster will start refusing writes as soon as `NODE_TIMEOUT` time has elapsed without contact with the majority, so there is a maximum window after which the minority becomes no longer available. Hence, no writes are accepted or lost after that time.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Based on the knowledge base search, I found relevant information about CROSSSLOT errors in Redis Cluster.\\n\\n## The Problem\\n\\nIn Redis Cluster, **SORT and SUNION are single-slot commands** — they can only operate on keys that belong to the same hash slot.

Here's what's likely happening and how to fix it:\n\n## Root Cause\n\nDuring AOF rewrite, Redis forks a child process that writes to a **temporary file**. The error occurs when:\n\n1. **File permissions** - The Redis process doesn't have write permissions in the AOF directory\n2. **Directory permissions** - The parent directory lacks execute/write permissions\n3. **SELinux/AppArmor** - Security policies blocking file creation\n4. **File ownership mismatch** - AOF directory owned by different user than Redis process\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n### 1. Check File Permissions\n```bash\nls -la /path/to/redis/dir/\n# AOF directory should be writable by Redis user\n```\n\n### 2. Verify Redis Process User\n```bash\nps aux | grep redis-server\n# Check which user is running Redis\n```\n\n### 3. Fix Permissions\n```bash\n# If Redis runs as 'redis' user:\nchown -R redis:redis /var/lib/redis/\nchmod 755 /var/lib/redis/\n```\n\n### 4. Check Redis Logs\nLook for more specific error details:\n```bash\ntail -f /var/log/redis/redis-server.log\n```\n\n### 5. Verify AOF Configuration\n```bash\nredis-cli CONFIG GET dir\nredis-cli CONFIG GET appendfilename\n```\n\n## How AOF Rewrite Works (Redis >= 7.0)\n\nThe rewrite process creates temporary files before atomic rename:\n\n1. Child process writes new **base AOF** to temporary file\n2. Parent opens new **increments AOF** file\n3. Child completes → parent builds temp manifest\n4. Atomic exchange of manifest files\n5. Cleanup of old files\n\n**The temporary file creation is where permission errors occur.**\n\n## Quick Fix\n\n```bash\n# 1. Stop Redis gracefully\nredis-cli SHUTDOWN SAVE\n\n# 2. Fix permissions\nchown redis:redis /var/lib/redis/\nchmod 755 /var/lib/redis/\n\n# 3. Restart Redis\nsystemctl start redis\n```\n\n## Prevention\n\nAdd to your Redis configuration:\n```\n# Ensure AOF directory has correct permissions on startup\ndir /var/lib/redis\nappendonly yes\nappendfilename \"appendonly.aof\"\n```\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md > Append-only file > How it works]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["AOF", "rewrite", "append", "search"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "06bf719a-a1c7-48ed-a905-574b8a69eb35", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "dfb83ed1-3d0b-40ca-ab44-09fcf9bcb594", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='I\\'ll search for information about Redis AOF rewrite failures with the \"Can\\'t open the append-only file\" error.')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_ogLtOXnYsWE93Zw4GmTAhI', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': \"Can't open the append-only file|AOF rewrite|appendonly\"})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_zQHW0IaFiYQruEiUbEErV0', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': \"Redis AOF rewrite failing can't open append-only file permission error\", 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_ogLtOXnYsWE93Zw4GmTAhI', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_zQHW0IaFiYQruEiUbEErV0', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.465,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Append-only file > What should I do if my AOF gets corrupted?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"It is possible the server crashed while writing the AOF file, or the\\\\\\\\nvolume where the AOF file is stored was full at the time of writing.

Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for. However\\\\\\\\nthere is not just a single swap field since the smaps file contains the\\\\\\\\ndifferent memory maps of our Redis process (The memory layout of a process\\\\\\\\nis more complex than a simple linear array of pages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince we are interested in all the memory swapped by our process the first thing\\\\\\\\nto do is to grep for the Swap field across all the file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | grep \\'Swap:\\'\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf everything is 0 kB, or if there are sporadic 4k entries, everything is\\\\\\\\nperfectly normal. Actually in our example instance (the one of a real web\\\\\\\\nsite running Redis and serving hundreds of users every second) there are a\\\\\\\\nfew entries that show more swapped pages. To investigate if this is a serious\\\\\\\\nproblem or not we change our command in order to also print the size of the\\\\\\\\nmemory map:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | egrep \\'^(Swap|Size)\\'\\\\\\\\n    Size:                316 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 40 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                132 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:             720896 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               4096 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               4096 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               4096 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               1272 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 16 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 84 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                144 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                108 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                272 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see from the output, there is a map of 720896 kB\\\\\\\\n(with just 12 kB swapped) and 156 kB more swapped in another map:\\\\\\\\nbasically a very small amount of our memory is swapped so this is not\\\\\\\\ngoing to create any problem at all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf instead a non trivial amount of the process memory is swapped on disk your\\\\\\\\nlatency problems are likely related to swapping.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server.

For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted.

Keyspace 事件（频道格式：`__keyspace@<db>__:key`）\n- `E` - Keyevent 事件（频道格式：`__keyevent@<db>__:event`）\n\n**事件类型：**\n- `x` - **过期事件**（key 过期时触发）⭐ 你需要的\n- `e` - 驱逐事件（maxmemory 导致 key 被驱逐）\n- `g` - 通用命令（DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME 等）\n- `$` - String 命令\n- `l` - List 命令\n- `s` - Set 命令\n- `h` - Hash 命令\n- `z` - Sorted Set 命令\n- `t` - Stream 命令\n- `A` - 别名，等同于 `g$lshztdxe`（大部分事件）\n\n### 3. 监听 key 过期事件的推荐配置\n\n```bash\n# 监听所有 key 的过期事件（Keyspace 模式）\nCONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events Kx\n\n# 或者监听特定事件类型的所有 key（Keyevent 模式）\nCONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events Ex\n\n# 或者同时启用两种模式\nCONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events KEx\n```\n\n### 4. 订阅过期事件\n\n**Keyspace 模式**（监听特定 key）：\n```bash\nSUBSCRIBE __keyspace@0__:mykey\n# 当 mykey 过期时收到消息：expired\n```\n\n**Keyevent 模式**（监听所有过期事件）：\n```bash\nSUBSCRIBE __keyevent@0__:expired\n# 收到所有过期 key 的名称\n```\n\n## 重要提示\n\n⚠️ **过期事件的时机**：\n- 过期事件是在 Redis **删除** key 时触发，而不是 TTL 到 0 时\n- 如果 key 从未被访问且后台清理未触发，可能会有延迟\n- 这是 fire-and-forget 机制，客户端断线期间的事件会丢失\n\n⚠️ **集群环境**：\n- 每个节点只发送自己管理的 keyspace 事件\n- 需要订阅所有节点才能收到完整的事件\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/pubsub/keyspace-notifications.md > Configuration]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/pubsub/keyspace-notifications.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["maxmemory", "KEYS", "sorted set", "keyspace", "notification", "expired", "memory"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/pubsub/keyspace-notifications.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "e2a2b19b-0eb3-4ff3-8efb-1bfcd08fe6de", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "c049a651-de20-4770-9d55-2cf776923971", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来帮你查找 Redis keyspace notifications 的配置方法。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_A7gfzZitFehFP43DrSkyyE', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'keyspace notifications?|notify-keyspace-events|expired?.*event'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_wgAwDE3aHLcCOjR6wJp7dO', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis keyspace notifications 配置 监听 key 过期事件 notify-keyspace-events', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_A7gfzZitFehFP43DrSkyyE', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_wgAwDE3aHLcCOjR6wJp7dO', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.0103,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"693e35dd\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"693e35dd-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/pubsub/keyspace-notifications.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis keyspace notifications\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"By default keyspace event notifications are disabled because while not\\\\\\\\nvery sensible the feature uses some CPU power.

It's designed to be simple to implement, fast to parse, and human-readable.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n- **Binary-safe**: Uses prefixed length for bulk data transfer\n- **Multiple data types**: Can serialize integers, strings, arrays, and errors\n- **Protocol versions**: RESP2 (standard since Redis 2.0), RESP3 (introduced in Redis 6.0)\n- **Transport**: Uses TCP connections (default port 6379) or Unix sockets\n\n### How Client-Server Communication Works\n\n**1. Request-Response Model**\n\nThe basic flow is:\n- Client sends commands as an **array of bulk strings** to the server\n- Server processes the command and replies with a RESP data type\n- The reply type depends on the command implementation\n\n**2. Connection Setup**\n\n- Client creates a TCP connection to Redis server (port 6379)\n- New connections should call the `HELLO` command to:\n  - Negotiate protocol version (RESP2 or RESP3)\n  - Get server information (version, mode, role, etc.)\n  - Authenticate if needed\n\n**3. Command Format**\n\nCommands are sent as RESP arrays. For example, `LLEN mylist`:\n\n```\n*2\\r\\n          # Array with 2 elements\n$4\\r\\n          # Bulk string of 4 bytes\nLLEN\\r\\n        # Command name\n$6\\r\\n          # Bulk string of 6 bytes\nmylist\\r\\n      # Key name\n```\n\nServer replies with the appropriate type (e.g., integer):\n```\n:48293\\r\\n      # Integer reply\n```\n\n**4. Data Type Encoding**\n\nEach RESP type is identified by its first byte:\n- `+` Simple strings (e.g., `+OK\\r\\n`)\n- `-` Errors (e.g., `-ERR unknown command\\r\\n`)\n- `:` Integers (e.g., `:1000\\r\\n`)\n- `$` Bulk strings (binary-safe)\n- `*` Arrays\n- RESP3 adds: `_` (null), `#` (boolean), `,` (double), `%` (map), `~` (set), etc.\n\n**5. Special Cases**\n\n- **Pipelining**: Clients can send multiple commands without waiting for each reply, improving performance\n- **Pub/Sub**: Protocol becomes push-based when subscribing to channels\n- **RESP3 Push types**: Server can send out-of-band data at any time\n\n### Protocol Evolution\n\n- **Redis 1.2**: RESP introduced (optional)\n- **Redis 2.0**: RESP2 became standard\n- **Redis 6.0**: RESP3 support (opt-in via `HELLO` command)\n- **Redis 7.0+**: Both RESP2 and RESP3 fully supported\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/protocol-spec.md

\\\\\"To communicate with the Redis server, Redis clients use a protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5897,\\\\n

session by calling the [`HELLO`]() command.\\\\\\\\nThis practice accomplishes two things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. It allows servers to be backward compatible with RESP2 versions.\\\\\\\\n  This is needed in Redis to make the transition to version 3 of the protocol gentler.\\\\\\\\n2. The [`HELLO`]() command returns information about the server and the protocol that the client can use for different goals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`HELLO`]() command has the following high-level syntax:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HELLO <protocol-version> [optional-arguments]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first argument of the command is the protocol version we want the connection to be set.\\\\\\\\nBy default, the connection starts in RESP2 mode.\\\\\\\\nIf we specify a connection version that is too big and unsupported by the server, it should reply with a `-NOPROTO` error. Example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 4\\\\\\\\n    Server: -NOPROTO sorry, this protocol version is not supported.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\nAt that point, the client may retry with a lower protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the client can easily detect a server that is only able to speak RESP2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR unknown command \\'HELLO\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client can then proceed and use RESP2 to communicate with the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that even if the protocol\\'s version is supported, the [`HELLO`]() command may return an error, perform no action and remain in RESP2 mode. \\\\\\\\nFor example, when used with invalid authentication credentials in the command\\'s optional `AUTH` clause:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3 AUTH default mypassword\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR invalid password\\\\\\\\n    (the connection remains in RESP2 mode)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA successful reply to the [`HELLO`]() command is a map reply.\\\\\\\\nThe information in the reply is partly server-dependent, but certain fields are mandatory for all the RESP3 implementations:\\\\\\\\n* **server**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"redis\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (or other software name).\\\\\\\\n* **version**: the server\\'s version.\\\\\\\\n* **proto**: the highest supported version of the RESP protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis\\' RESP3 implementation, the following fields are also emitted:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **id**: the connection\\'s identifier (ID).\\\\\\\\n* **mode**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"standalone\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cluster\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **role**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"master\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"replica\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **modules**: list of loaded modules as an Array of Bulk Strings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that you are familiar with the RESP serialization format, you can use it to help write a Redis client library.\\\\\\\\nWe can further specify how the interaction between the client and the server works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A client sends the Redis server an [array](#arrays) consisting of only bulk strings.\\\\\\\\n* A Redis server replies to clients, sending any valid RESP data type as a reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, for example, a typical interaction could be the following.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client sends the command `LLEN mylist` to get the length of the list stored at the key _mylist_.\\\\\\\\nThen the server replies with an [integer](#integers) reply as in the following example (`C:` is the client, `S:` the server).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: $4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: LLEN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: $6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: mylist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    S: :48293\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs usual, we separate different parts of the protocol with newlines for simplicity, but the actual interaction is the client sending `*2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLLEN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nmylist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` as a

exceptions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis requests can be [pipelined](#multiple-commands-and-pipelining).\\\\\\\\n  Pipelining enables clients to send multiple commands at once and wait for replies later.\\\\\\\\n* When a RESP2 connection subscribes to a [Pub/Sub]() channel, the protocol changes semantics and becomes a *push* protocol.\\\\\\\\n  The client no longer requires sending commands because the server will automatically send new messages to the client (for the channels the client is subscribed to) as soon as they are received.\\\\\\\\n* The [`MONITOR`]() command.\\\\\\\\n  Invoking the [`MONITOR`]() command switches the connection to an ad-hoc push mode.\\\\\\\\n  The protocol of this mode is not specified but is obvious to parse.\\\\\\\\n* [Protected mode]().\\\\\\\\n  Connections opened from a non-loopback address to a Redis while in protected mode are denied and terminated by the server.\\\\\\\\n  Before terminating the connection, Redis unconditionally sends a `-DENIED` reply, regardless of whether the client writes to the socket.\\\\\\\\n* The [RESP3 Push type](#resp3-pushes).\\\\\\\\n  As the name suggests, a push type allows the server to send out-of-band data to the connection.\\\\\\\\n  The server may push data at any time, and the data isn\\'t necessarily related to specific commands executed by the client.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nExcluding these exceptions, the Redis protocol is a simple request-response protocol.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.0344,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244\\\\\",\\\\n

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Clients send commands to the Redis server as RESP arrays.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, some Redis commands that return collections of elements use arrays as their replies. \\\\\\\\nAn example is the [`LRANGE`]() command that returns elements of a list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP Arrays\\' encoding uses the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *<number-of-elements>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n<element-1>...<element-n>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An asterisk (`*`) as the first byte.\\\\\\\\n* One or more decimal digits (`0`..`9`) as the number of elements in the array as an unsigned, base-10 value.\\\\\\\\n* The CRLF terminator.\\\\\\\\n* An additional RESP type for every element of the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo an empty Array is just the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhereas the encoding of an array consisting of the two bulk strings \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and

*2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nhello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nworld\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see, after the `*<count>CRLF` part prefixing the array, the other data types that compose the array are concatenated one after the other.\\\\\\\\nFor example, an Array of three integers is encoded as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n

supports several data types.\\\\\\\\nIn RESP, the first byte of data determines its type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis generally uses RESP as a [request-response](#request-response-model) protocol in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients send commands to a Redis server as an [array](#arrays) of [bulk strings](#bulk-strings).\\\\\\\\n  The first (and sometimes also the second) bulk string in the array is the command\\'s name.\\\\\\\\n  Subsequent elements of the array are the arguments for the command.\\\\\\\\n* The server replies with a RESP type.\\\\\\\\n  The reply\\'s type is determined by the command\\'s implementation and possibly by the client\\'s protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a binary protocol that uses control sequences encoded in standard ASCII.\\\\\\\\nThe `A` character, for example, is encoded with the binary byte of value 65.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the characters CR (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`), LF (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) and SP (` `) have binary byte values of 13, 10 and 32, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` (CRLF) is the protocol\\'s _terminator_, which **always** separates its parts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first byte in an RESP-serialized payload always identifies its type.\\\\\\\\nSubsequent bytes constitute the type\\'s contents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe categorize every RESP data type as either _simple_, _bulk_ or _aggregate_.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimple types are similar to scalars in programming languages that represent plain literal values. Booleans and Integers are such examples.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP strings are either _simple_ or _bulk_.\\\\\\\\nSimple strings never contain carriage return (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`) or line feed (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) characters.\\\\\\\\nBulk strings can contain any binary data and may also be referred to as _binary_ or _blob_.\\\\\\\\nNote that bulk strings may be further encoded and decoded, e.g. with a wide multi-byte encoding, by the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAggregates, such as Arrays and Maps, can have varying numbers of sub-elements and nesting levels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following table summarizes the RESP data types that Redis supports:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| RESP data type | Minimal protocol version | Category | First byte |\\\\\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\\\\\n| [Simple strings](#simple-strings) | RESP2 | Simple | `+` |\\\\\\\\n| [Simple Errors](#simple-errors) | RESP2 | Simple | `-` |\\\\\\\\n| [Integers](#integers) | RESP2 | Simple | `:` |\\\\\\\\n| [Bulk strings](#bulk-strings) | RESP2 | Aggregate | `$` |\\\\\\\\n| [Arrays](#arrays) | RESP2 | Aggregate | `*` |\\\\\\\\n| [Nulls](#nulls) | RESP3 | Simple | `_` |\\\\\\\\n| [Booleans](#booleans) | RESP3 | Simple | `#` |\\\\\\\\n| [Doubles](#doubles) | RESP3 | Simple | `,` |\\\\\\\\n| [Big numbers](#big-numbers) | RESP3 | Simple | `(` |\\\\\\\\n| [Bulk errors](#bulk-errors) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `!` |\\\\\\\\n| [Verbatim strings](#verbatim-strings) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `=` |\\\\\\\\n| [Maps](#maps) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `%` |\\\\\\\\n| [Attributes](#attributes) | RESP3 | Aggregate | <code>&#124;</code> |\\\\\\\\n| [Sets](#sets) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `~` |\\\\\\\\n| [Pushes](#pushes) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `>` |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"simple-string-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.096,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c-017\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Lua API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Lua to RESP2 type conversion > Lua to RESP3 type conversion\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Regardless of the script\\'s choice of protocol version set for replies with the [`redis.setresp()` function] when it calls `redis.call()` or `redis.pcall()`, the user may opt-in to using RESP3 (with the `HELLO 3` command) for the connection.\\\\\\\\nAlthough the default protocol for incoming client connections is RESP2, the script should honor the user\\'s preference and return adequately-typed RESP3 replies, so the following rules apply on top of those specified in the [Lua to RESP2 type conversion](#lua-to-resp2-type-conversion) section when that is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Lua Boolean -> [RESP3 Boolean reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#boolean-reply) (note that this is a change compared to the RESP2, in which returning a Boolean Lua `true` returned the number 1 to the Redis client, and returning a `false` used to return a `null`.\\\\\\\\n* Lua table with a single _map_ field set to an associative Lua table -> [RESP3 map reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#map-type).\\\\\\\\n* Lua table with a single _set_ field set to an associative Lua table -> [RESP3 set reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#set-type).

with RESP3-typed responses, Redis will automatically perform a RESP3 to RESP2 conversion of the reply as is the case for regular commands.\\\\\\\\nThat means, for example, that returning the RESP3 map type to a RESP2 connection will result in the reply being converted to a flat RESP2 array that consists of alternating field names and their values, rather than a RESP3 map.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n

replies:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    -ERR unknown command \\'asdf\\'\\\\\\\\n    -WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first upper-case word after the `-`, up to the first space or newline, represents the kind of error returned.\\\\\\\\nThis word is called an _error prefix_.\\\\\\\\nNote that the error prefix is a convention used by Redis rather than part of the RESP error type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, in Redis, `ERR` is a generic error, whereas `WRONGTYPE` is a more specific error that implies that the client attempted an operation against the wrong data type.\\\\\\\\nThe error prefix allows the client to understand the type of error returned by the server without checking the exact error message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client implementation can return different types of exceptions for various errors, or provide a generic way for trapping errors by directly providing the error name to the caller as a string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, such a feature should not be considered vital as it is rarely useful. \\\\\\\\nAlso, simpler client implementations can return a generic error value, such as

For this reason when a client enables tracking, it can specify to redirect the invalidation messages to another connection by specifying the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"client ID\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of a different connection. Many data connections can redirect invalidation messages to the same connection, this is useful for clients implementing connection pooling. The two connections model is the only one that is also supported for RESP2 (which lacks the ability to multiplex different kind of information in the same connection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of a complete session using the Redis protocol in the old RESP2 mode involving the following steps: enabling tracking redirecting to another connection, asking for a key, and getting an invalidation message once the key gets modified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo start, the client opens a first connection that will be used for invalidations, requests the connection ID, and subscribes via Pub/Sub to the special channel that is used to get invalidation messages when in RESP2 modes (remember that RESP2 is the usual Redis protocol, and not the more advanced protocol that you can use, optionally, with Redis 6 using the [`HELLO`]() command):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT ID\\\\\\\\n:4\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE __redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$9\\\\\\\\nsubscribe\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow we can enable tracking from the data connection:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 2 -- data connection)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 4\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGET foo\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nbar\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client may decide to cache `\\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" => \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` in the local memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA different client will now modify the value of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" key:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Some other unrelated connection)\\\\\\\\nSET foo bar\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result, the invalidations connection will receive a message that invalidates the specified key.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$7\\\\\\\\nmessage\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*1\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nfoo\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe client will check if there are cached keys in this caching slot, and will evict the information that is no longer valid.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the third element of the Pub/Sub message is not a single key but\\\\\\\\nis a Redis array with just a single element.

Here's why this number was chosen and how key mapping works:\n\n## Why 16384?\n\nThe number 16384 (2^14) was chosen for practical reasons:\n\n1. **Efficient bitmap transmission**: Each node needs to exchange hash slot configuration in heartbeat packets. With 16384 slots, the bitmap requires only 2KB (16384 bits / 8 = 2KB), which is efficient for network transmission.\n\n2. **Upper limit consideration**: While 16384 technically sets an upper limit of 16384 master nodes, the recommended cluster size is around ~1000 nodes, making this number more than sufficient.\n\n3. **Good distribution**: CRC16 testing showed that using 14 out of 16 bits (hence the modulo 16384) provides excellent even distribution of different key types across slots.\n\n## How Keys Are Mapped\n\nThe mapping algorithm is straightforward:\n\n```\nHASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\n```\n\n**CRC16 specification used:**\n- Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\n- Width: 16 bit\n- Poly: 1021 (x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\n- Initialization: 0000\n- Output for \"123456789\": 31C3\n\nEach master node is responsible for a subset of these slots. For example, in a 3-node cluster:\n- Node A: slots 0-5500\n- Node B: slots 5501-11000  \n- Node C: slots 11001-16383\n\n## Hash Tags for Multi-Key Operations\n\nYou can force multiple keys into the same hash slot using **hash tags** with curly braces `{}`. Only the substring within braces is hashed:\n\n- `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` → same slot (only `123` is hashed)\n- This enables multi-key operations like `SINTER {group}:1 {group}:2` in cluster mode\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md > Redis Cluster 101 > Redis Cluster master-replica model]**\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md > Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Key distribution model]**", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/keyspace.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["replica", "cluster", "hash slot", "KEYS", "RESP", "16384", "CRC16"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/keyspace.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "6a8ef9c9-b9d2-4b0b-a8b2-815dea472e56", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "63118973-67c3-445a-a262-85771c9ce7bd", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Redis cluster hash slots and key mapping.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_njdPZrUr7ahm72QUFANmc0', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis cluster 16384 hash slots why this number key mapping', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_geRnDW5wKPyAUt5dxehaLd', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': '16384|hash slot'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_njdPZrUr7ahm72QUFANmc0', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2396,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster 101 > Redis Cluster master-replica model\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster does not use consistent hashing, but a different form of sharding\\\\\\\\nwhere every key is conceptually part of what we call a **hash slot**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute the hash\\\\\\\\nslot for a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo\\\\\\\\n16384.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,\\\\\\\\nso, for example, you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.\\\\\\\\n* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.\\\\\\\\n* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes it easy to add and remove cluster nodes. For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.0407,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Key distribution model\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The cluster\\'s key space is split into 16384 slots, effectively setting an upper limit\\\\\\\\nfor the cluster size of 16384 master nodes (however, the suggested max size of\\\\\\\\nnodes is on the order of ~ 1000 nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach master node in a cluster handles a subset of the 16384 hash slots.\\\\\\\\nThe cluster is **stable** when there is no cluster reconfiguration in\\\\\\\\nprogress (i.e. where hash slots are being moved from one node to another).\\\\\\\\nWhen the cluster is stable, a single hash slot will be served by a single node\\\\\\\\n(however the serving node can have one or more replicas that will replace it in the case of net splits or failures,\\\\\\\\nand that can be used in order to scale read operations where reading stale data is acceptable).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe base algorithm used to map keys to hash slots is the following\\\\\\\\n(read the next paragraph for the hash tag exception to this rule):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe CRC16 is specified as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\\\\\\\\n* Width: 16 bit\\\\\\\\n* Poly: 1021 (That is actually x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\\\\\\\\n* Initialization: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Input byte: False\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Output CRC: False\\\\\\\\n* Xor constant to output CRC: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Output for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"123456789\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 31C3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n14 out of 16 CRC16 output bits are used (this is why there is\\\\\\\\na modulo 16384 operation in the formula above).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our tests CRC16 behaved remarkably well in distributing different kinds of\\\\\\\\nkeys evenly across the 16384 slots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note**: A reference implementation of the CRC16 algorithm used is available in the Appendix A of this document.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.1458,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"14f2e82d\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"14f2e82d-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/keyspace.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Keys and values\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Content of keys > Hashtags\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis uses [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) to retrieve the\\\\\\\\nvalue associated with a key in a highly efficient way.

This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.7046,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > MOVED Redirection\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis client is free to send queries to every node in the cluster, including\\\\\\\\nreplica nodes.

Here's why this number was chosen and how key mapping works:\n\n## Why 16384?\n\nThe number 16384 (2^14) was chosen for practical reasons:\n\n1. **Efficient bitmap transmission**: Each node needs to exchange hash slot configuration in heartbeat packets. With 16384 slots, the bitmap requires only 2KB (16384 bits / 8 = 2KB), which is efficient for network transmission.\n\n2. **Upper limit consideration**: While 16384 technically sets an upper limit of 16384 master nodes, the recommended cluster size is around ~1000 nodes, making this number more than sufficient.\n\n3. **Good distribution**: CRC16 testing showed that using 14 out of 16 bits (hence the modulo 16384) provides excellent even distribution of different key types across slots.\n\n## How Keys Are Mapped\n\nThe mapping algorithm is straightforward:\n\n```\nHASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\n```\n\n**CRC16 specification used:**\n- Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\n- Width: 16 bit\n- Poly: 1021 (x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\n- Initialization: 0000\n- Output for \"123456789\": 31C3\n\nEach master node is responsible for a subset of these slots. For example, in a 3-node cluster:\n- Node A: slots 0-5500\n- Node B: slots 5501-11000  \n- Node C: slots 11001-16383\n\n## Hash Tags for Multi-Key Operations\n\nYou can force multiple keys into the same hash slot using **hash tags** with curly braces `{}`. Only the substring within braces is hashed:\n\n- `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` → same slot (only `123` is hashed)\n- This enables multi-key operations like `SINTER {group}:1 {group}:2` in cluster mode\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md > Redis Cluster 101 > Redis Cluster master-replica model]**\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md > Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Key distribution model]**", "session_id": "6a8ef9c9-b9d2-4b0b-a8b2-815dea472e56", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 89871, "total_cost_usd": 0.053642249999999995, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1299, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2599, "cache_read_input_tokens": 32507, "output_tokens": 586, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

291.8947615623474, "cost_usd": 0.14311425, "num_turns": 7, "answer_length": 1421, "answer": "根据检索到的 Redis 官方文档，我来回答你的内存碎片问题：\n\n## 内存碎片产生的原因\n\n你的情况（10GB 物理内存 vs 2GB 实际数据）是典型的内存碎片问题。Redis 文档解释了这个现象：\n\n1. **内存分配器特性**：Redis 删除键时，底层分配器（jemalloc）不会立即将内存归还给操作系统。删除的键和仍存在的键往往分配在同一内存页上，导致无法释放整页内存。\n\n2. **RSS vs 实际使用**：\n   - RSS (Resident Set Size)：进程实际占用的物理内存（你的 10GB）\n   - 逻辑使用内存：Redis 报告的数据大小（你的 2GB）\n   - 碎片率 = RSS / 逻辑使用内存 = 10GB / 2GB = 5.0\n\n3. **峰值内存影响**：如果你的 Redis 曾经达到过 10GB 数据量，后来删除了 8GB，RSS 仍会保持在 10GB 左右。\n\n## 处理方法\n\n### 方法 1：等待内存复用（推荐用于稳定负载）\n- 分配器会复用已释放的内存块\n- 当你再次写入数据时，RSS 不会继续增长，而是复用那 8GB 的\"碎片\"空间\n- **适用场景**：数据量会回升到接近峰值\n\n### 方法 2：重启 Redis（最直接）\n- 重启后内存会完全释放，RSS 恢复到实际数据大小\n- **缺点**：需要停机或主从切换\n- **适用场景**：碎片率 > 1.5 且数据量不会再回升\n\n### 方法 3：使用 jemalloc 分配器\n- Redis 默认使用 jemalloc，它比 libc malloc 更能减少碎片\n- 确认你的 Redis 编译时启用了 jemalloc：`redis-server --version`\n- 如果用的是 libc，考虑重新编译启用 jemalloc\n\n### 方法 4：容量规划\n- **按峰值内存规划**：文档明确指出，即使平时只用 5GB，峰值需要 10GB 就必须按 10GB 规划\n- 设置 `maxmemory` 限制，避免无限增长\n- 配置 `maxmemory-policy`（如 `allkeys-lru`）在达到上限时自动淘汰\n\n## 监控建议\n\n```bash\n# 查看内存碎片率\nredis-cli INFO memory | grep mem_fragmentation_ratio\n\n# 查看详细内存使用\nredis-cli INFO memory\n```\n\n- 碎片率 < 1.0：正常\n- 碎片率 1.0 - 1.5：可接受\n- 碎片率 > 1.5：需要关注\n- 碎片率 > 2.0：建议重启或调整\n\n## 注意事项\n\n⚠️ **文档中未提及 `activedefrag` 配置**：我在 Redis 官方文档中没有找到主动碎片整理（active defragmentation）的相关配置。这可能是较新版本的特性，建议查看你的 Redis 版本文档或运行 `CONFIG GET *defrag*` 确认是否支持。\n\n[来源:

detailed information).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is not just useful in order for Redis to be able to account for the memory used by the module, but there are also more advantages:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis uses the `jemalloc` allocator, that often prevents fragmentation problems that could be caused by using the libc allocator.\\\\\\\\n* When loading strings from the RDB file, the native types API is able to return strings allocated directly with `RedisModule_Alloc()`, so that the module can directly link this memory into the data structure representation, avoiding a useless copy of the data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if you are using external libraries implementing your data structures, the\\\\\\\\nallocation functions provided by the module API is exactly compatible with\\\\\\\\n`malloc()`, `realloc()`, `free()` and `strdup()`, so converting the libraries\\\\\\\\nin order to use these functions should be trivial.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn case you have an external library that uses libc `malloc()`, and you want\\\\\\\\nto avoid replacing manually all the calls with the Redis Modules API calls,\\\\\\\\nan approach could be to use simple macros in order to replace the libc calls\\\\\\\\nwith the Redis API calls. Something like this could work:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    #define malloc RedisModule_Alloc\\\\\\\\n    #define realloc RedisModule_Realloc\\\\\\\\n    #define free RedisModule_Free\\\\\\\\n    #define strdup RedisModule_Strdup\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever take in mind that mixing libc calls with Redis API calls will result\\\\\\\\ninto troubles and crashes, so if you replace calls using macros, you need to\\\\\\\\nmake sure that all the calls are correctly replaced, and that the code with\\\\\\\\nthe substituted calls will never, for example, attempt to call\\\\\\\\n`RedisModule_Free()` with a pointer allocated using libc `malloc()`.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.7023,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory allocation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To store user keys, Redis allocates at most as much memory as the `maxmemory`\\\\\\\\nsetting enables (however there are small extra allocations possible).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe exact value can be set in the configuration file or set later via\\\\\\\\n[`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) (for more info, see [Using memory as an LRU cache]()).\\\\\\\\nThere are a few things that should be noted about how Redis manages memory:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis will not always free up (return) memory to the OS when keys are removed.\\\\\\\\nThis is not something special about Redis, but it is how most malloc() implementations work.\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you fill an instance with 5GB worth of data, and then\\\\\\\\nremove the equivalent of 2GB of data, the Resident Set Size (also known as\\\\\\\\nthe RSS, which is the number of memory pages consumed by the process)\\\\\\\\nwill probably still be around 5GB, even if Redis will claim that the user\\\\\\\\nmemory is around 3GB.  This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory

to a certain size.\\n    22→Hashes, Lists, Sets composed of just integers, and Sorted Sets, when smaller than a given number of elements, and up to a maximum element size, are encoded in a very memory-efficient way that uses *up to 10 times less memory* (with 5 times less memory used being the average saving).\\n    23→\\n    24→This is completely transparent from the point of view of the user and API.\\n    25→Since this is a CPU / memory tradeoff it is possible to tune the maximum \\n    26→number of elements and maximum element size for special encoded types \\n    27→using the following redis.conf directives (defaults are shown):\\n    28→\\n    29→### Redis <= 6.2\\n    30→\\n    31→```\\n    32→hash-max-ziplist-entries 512\\n    33→hash-max-ziplist-value 64\\n

56→```\\n    57→\\n    58→If a specially encoded value overflows the configured max size,\\n    59→Redis will automatically convert it into normal encoding.\\n    60→This operation is very fast for small values,\\n    61→but if you change the setting in order to use specially encoded values\\n    62→for much larger aggregate types the suggestion is to run some \\n    63→benchmarks and tests to check the conversion time.\\n    64→\\n    65→## Using 32-bit instances\\n    66→\\n    67→\\n    68→When Redis is compiled as a 32-bit target, it uses a lot less memory per key, since pointers are small,\\n    69→but such an instance will be limited to 4 GB of maximum memory usage.\\n    70→To compile Redis as 32-bit binary use *make 32bit*.\\n    71→RDB and AOF files are compatible between 32-bit and 64-bit instances\\n    72→(and between little and big endian of course) so you can switch from 32 to 64-bit, or the contrary, without problems.\\n    73→\\n    74→## Bit and byte level operations\\n    75→\\n    76→Redis 2.2 introduced new bit and byte level operations: [`GETRANGE`](/commands/getrange), [`SETRANGE`](/commands/setrange), [`GETBIT`](/commands/getbit) and [`SETBIT`](/commands/setbit).\\n    77→Using these commands you can treat the Redis string type as a random access array.\\n    78→For instance, if you have an application where users are identified by a unique progressive integer number,\\n    79→you can use a bitmap to save information about the subscription of users in a mailing list,\\n    80→setting the bit for subscribed and clearing it for unsubscribed, or the other way around.\\n    81→With 100 million users this data will take just 12 megabytes of RAM in a Redis instance.\\n    82→You can do the same using [`GETRANGE`](/commands/getrange) and [`SETRANGE`](/commands/setrange) to store one byte of information for each user.\\n    83→This is just an example but it is possible to model several problems in very little space with these new primitives.\\n    84→\\n    85→## Use hashes when possible\\n    86→\\n    87→\\n    88→Small hashes are encoded in a very small space, so you should try representing your data using hashes whenever possible.\\n    89→For instance, if you have objects representing users in a web application, \\n    90→instead of using different keys for name, surname, email, password, use a single hash with all the required fields.\\n    91→\\n    92→If you want to know more about this, read the next section.\\n    93→\\n    94→## Using hashes to abstract a very memory-efficient plain key-value store on top of Redis\\n    95→\\n    96→I understand the title of this section is a bit scary, but I\\'m going to explain in detail what this is about.\\n    97→\\n    98→Basically it is possible to model a plain key-value store using Redis\\n    99→where values can just be just strings, which is not just more memory efficient\\n   100→than Redis plain keys but also much more memory efficient than memcached.\\n   101→\\n   102→Let\\'s start with some facts: a few keys use a lot more memory than a single key\\n   103→containing a hash with a few fields. How is this possible? We use a trick.\\n   104→In theory to guarantee that we perform lookups in constant time\\n   105→(also known as O(1) in big O notation) there is the need to use a data structure\\n   106→with a constant time complexity in the average case, like a hash table.\\n   107→\\n   108→But many times hashes contain just a few fields. When hashes are small we can\\n   109→instead just encode them in an O(N) data structure, like a linear\\n   110→array with length-prefixed key-value pairs. Since we do this only when N\\n   111→is small, the amortized time for [`HGET`](/commands/hget) and [`HSET`](/commands/hset) commands is still O(1): the\\n   112→hash will be converted into a real hash table as soon as the number of elements\\n   113→it contains grows too large (you can configure the limit in redis.conf).\\n   114→\\n   115→This does not only work well from the point of view of time complexity, but\\n   116→also from the point of view of constant times since a linear array of key-value pairs happens to play very well with the CPU cache (it has a better\\n   117→cache locality than a hash table).\\n   118→\\n   119→However since hash fields and values are not (always) represented as full-featured Redis objects, hash fields can\\'t have an associated time to live\\n   120→(expire) like a real key, and can only contain a string. But we are okay with\\n   121→this, this was the intention anyway when the hash data type API was\\n   122→designed (we trust simplicity more than features, so nested data structures\\n   123→are not allowed, as expires of single fields are not allowed).\\n   124→\\n   125→So hashes are memory efficient. This is useful when using hashes\\n   126→to represent objects or to model other problems when there are group of\\n   127→related fields. But what about if we have a plain key value business?\\n   128→\\n   129→Imagine we want to use Redis as a cache for many small objects, which can be JSON encoded objects, small HTML fragments, simple key -> boolean values\\n   130→and so forth. Basically, anything is a string -> string map with small keys\\n   131→and values.\\n   132→\\n   133→Now let\\'s assume the objects we want to cache are numbered, like:\\n   134→\\n   135→ * object:102393\\n   136→ * object:1234\\n   137→ * object:5\\n   138→\\n   139→This is what we can do.

While Redis does run on Android, in the future we look forward to extend our testing efforts to Android\\\\\\\\nto also make it an officially supported platform.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe believe that Redis is ideal for IoT and embedded devices for several\\\\\\\\nreasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis has a very small memory footprint and CPU requirements. It can run in small devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero without impacting the overall performance, using a small amount of memory while delivering good performance for many use cases.\\\\\\\\n* The data structures of Redis are often an ideal way to model IoT/embedded use cases. Some examples include accumulating time series data, receiving or queuing commands to execute or respond to send back to the remote servers, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n* Modeling data inside Redis can be very useful in order to make in-device decisions for appliances that must respond very quickly or when the remote servers are offline.\\\\\\\\n* Redis can be used as a communication system between the processes running in the device.\\\\\\\\n* The append-only file storage of Redis is well suited for SSD cards.\\\\\\\\n* The stream data structure included in Redis versions 5.0 and higher was specifically designed for time series applications and has a very low memory overhead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux on ARM allows to trap unaligned accesses and fix them inside the kernel\\\\\\\\nin order to continue the execution of the offending program instead of\\\\\\\\ngenerating a `SIGBUS`. Redis 4.0 and greater are fixed in order to avoid any kind\\\\\\\\nof unaligned access, so there is no need to have a specific value for this\\\\\\\\nkernel configuration. Even when kernel alignment fixing set as disabled Redis should\\\\\\\\nrun as expected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Download Redis version 4.0 or higher.\\\\\\\\n* Use `make` as usual to create the executable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is nothing special in the process. The only difference is that by\\\\\\\\ndefault, Redis uses the `libc` allocator instead of defaulting to `jemalloc`\\\\\\\\nas it does in other Linux based environments. This is because we believe\\\\\\\\nthat for the small use cases inside embedded devices, memory fragmentation\\\\\\\\nis unlikely to be a problem.

there's always a window for losing acknowledged writes due to Redis's asynchronous replication\n- To limit data loss during network partitions, configure on the master:\n  ```\n  min-replicas-to-write 1\n  min-replicas-max-lag 10\n  ```\n  This prevents the master from accepting writes if it can't replicate to at least 1 replica within 10 seconds.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > A quick tutorial]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "failover", "replica", "notification", "RESP", "quorum", "monitor", "search"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "eb479c7e-cf39-41e4-80b5-b1a8ee47bec5", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "f5de9899-38d8-4319-8b76-7f43dad5fbd6", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about setting up Redis Sentinel with 3 nodes for high availability.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_Xcb1sOTw9jx8Nif997uNjV', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'Sentinel.*high availability|Redis Sentinel.*3 nodes|Sentinel.*setup|Sentinel.*configuration'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_NQiFy0YPbmekMvWfDWAIKk', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Sentinel setup 3 nodes high availability configuration', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_Xcb1sOTw9jx8Nif997uNjV', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_NQiFy0YPbmekMvWfDWAIKk', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.2803,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel quick start > Example Sentinel deployments > Example 4: Sentinel client side with less than three clients\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The setup described in the Example 3 cannot be used if there are less than\\\\\\\\nthree boxes in the client side (for example three web servers).

A partition occurred isolating the old master.\\\\\\\\nSentinels 1 and 2 started a failover promoting Sentinel 1 as the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Sentinel properties guarantee that Sentinel 1 and 2 now have the new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration for the master. However Sentinel 3 has still the old configuration\\\\\\\\nsince it lives in a different partition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe know that Sentinel 3 will get its configuration updated when the network\\\\\\\\npartition will heal, however what happens during the partition if there\\\\\\\\nare clients partitioned with the old master?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients will be still able to write to Redis 3, the old master. When the\\\\\\\\npartition will rejoin, Redis 3 will be turned into a replica of Redis 1, and\\\\\\\\nall the data written during the partition will be lost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDepending on your configuration you may want or not that this scenario happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a cache, it could be handy that Client B is still able to write to the old master, even if its data will be lost.\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a store, this is not good and you need to configure the system in order to partially prevent this problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis is asynchronously replicated, there is no way to totally prevent data loss in this scenario, however you can bound the divergence between Redis 3 and Redis 1\\\\\\\\nusing the following Redis configuration option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration the Redis 3 in the above example will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel 3 configuration will converge to\\\\\\\\nthe new one, and Client B will be able to fetch a valid configuration and continue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general Redis + Sentinel as a whole are an **eventually consistent system** where the merge function is **last failover wins**, and the data from old masters are discarded to replicate the data of the current master, so there is always a window for losing acknowledged writes. This is due to Redis asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication and the discarding nature of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merge function of the system. Note that this is not a limitation of Sentinel itself, and if you orchestrate the failover with a strongly consistent replicated state machine, the same properties will still apply. There are only two ways to avoid losing acknowledged writes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Use synchronous replication (and a proper consensus algorithm to run a replicated state machine).\\\\\\\\n2. Use an eventually consistent system where different versions of the same object can be merged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis currently is not able to use any of the above systems, and is currently outside the development goals. However there are proxies implementing solution \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on top of Redis stores such as SoundCloud [Roshi](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi), or Netflix [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel persistent state\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel state is persisted in the sentinel configuration file. For example\\\\\\\\nevery time a new configuration is received, or created (leader Sentinels), for\\\\\\\\na master, the configuration is persisted on disk together with the configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch. This means that it is safe to stop and restart Sentinel processes.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6157,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel as a distributed system\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel provides high availability for Redis when not using [Redis Cluster](). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel also provides other collateral tasks such as monitoring,\\\\\\\\nnotifications and acts as a configuration provider for clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the full list of Sentinel capabilities at a macroscopic level (i.e. the *big picture*):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Monitoring**. Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties. In this document concepts will be introduced gradually\\\\\\\\nstarting from basic information needed in order to understand the basic\\\\\\\\nproperties of Sentinel, to more complex information (that are optional) in\\\\\\\\norder to understand how exactly Sentinel works.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.4007,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-010\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"A quick tutorial\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In the next sections of this document, all the details about [_Sentinel API_](#sentinel-api),\\\\\\\\nconfiguration and semantics will be covered incrementally.

Since each *master set* has a different name, Sentinel can monitor different sets of masters and replicas at the same time.\\\\\\\\n* The quorum was set to the value of 2 (last argument of `sentinel monitor` configuration directive).\\\\\\\\n* The `down-after-milliseconds` value is 5000 milliseconds, that is 5 seconds, so masters will be detected as failing as soon as we don\\'t receive any reply from our pings within this amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you start the three Sentinels, you\\'ll see a few messages they log, like:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    +monitor master mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 quorum 2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is a Sentinel event, and you can receive this kind of events via Pub/Sub\\\\\\\\nif you [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe) to the event name as specified later in [_Pub/Sub Messages_ section](#pubsub-messages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel generates and logs different events during failure detection and\\\\\\\\nfailover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAsking Sentinel about the state of a master\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe most obvious thing to do with Sentinel to get started, is check if the\\\\\\\\nmaster it is monitoring is doing well:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli -p 5000\\\\\\\\n    127.0.0.1:5000> sentinel master mymaster\\\\\\\\n     1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n     2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"mymaster\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n     3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"ip\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n     4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"127.0.0.1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n     5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"port\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n     6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6379\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n     7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"runid\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n     8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"953ae6a589449c13ddefaee3538d356d287f509b\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n     9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"flags\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"master\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"link-pending-commands\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    13) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"link-refcount\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    14) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    15) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"last-ping-sent\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    16) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    17) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"last-ok-ping-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    18) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"735\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    19) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"last-ping-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    20) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"735\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    21) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"down-after-milliseconds\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    22) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"5000\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    23) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"info-refresh\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    24) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"126\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    25) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"role-reported\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    26) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"master\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    27) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"role-reported-time\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    28) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"532439\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    29) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"config-epoch\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    30) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    31) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"num-slaves\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    32) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    33) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"num-other-sentinels\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    34) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    35) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"quorum\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    36) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    37) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"failover-timeout\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    38) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"60000\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    39) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"parallel-syncs\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    40) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see, it prints a number of information about the master. There are\\\\\\\\na few that are of particular interest for us:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. `num-other-sentinels` is 2, so we know the Sentinel already detected two more Sentinels for this master. If you check the logs you\\'ll see the `+sentinel` events generated.\\\\\\\\n2. `flags` is just `master`. If the master was down we could expect to see `s_down` or `o_down` flag as well here.\\\\\\\\n3. `num-slaves` is correctly set to 1, so Sentinel also detected that there is an attached replica to our master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to explore more about this instance, you may want to try the following\\\\\\\\ntwo commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    SENTINEL replicas mymaster\\\\\\\\n    SENTINEL sentinels mymaster\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first will provide similar information about the replicas connected to the\\\\\\\\nmaster, and the second about the other Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nObtaining the address of the current master\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs we already specified, Sentinel also acts as a configuration provider for\\\\\\\\nclients that want to connect to a set of master and replicas.

"elapsed_seconds": 154.84975934028625, "cost_usd": 0.05948675, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 2882, "answer": "Based on the knowledge base search results, here's the comparison between Redis Functions and Lua scripts:\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### **Redis Functions (introduced in Redis 7.0)**\n- **First-class database artifacts**: Functions are managed as an integral part of the database, persisted via AOF and replicated to replicas\n- **Named and versioned**: Each function has a unique user-defined name, making it easier to call and trace execution\n- **Declared before use**: Applications don't need to load them during runtime, reducing the risk of aborted transactions\n- **Organized in libraries**: Functions belong to libraries that can contain multiple functions, enabling code sharing and reuse between functions\n- **Durable by default**: Stored alongside data, persisted to AOF, and replicated from master to replicas\n- **API-focused**: Applications depend on function APIs rather than embedded script logic\n\n### **Lua Scripts (EVAL/EVALSHA)**\n- **Ephemeral**: Scripts are considered part of the client application, not the database\n- **Cache-based**: Scripts are cached by SHA1 digest but can be lost after server restart, failover, or SCRIPT FLUSH\n- **Application responsibility**: The application must reload scripts if they're missing from the cache\n- **No code sharing**: Scripts can't call other scripts, making code reuse nearly impossible\n- **Network overhead**: EVAL sends the entire script each time; EVALSHA requires managing SHA1 digests\n- **Anonymous**: SHA1 digests are meaningless for debugging (e.g., in MONITOR sessions)\n\n## When to Use Which\n\n### **Use Redis Functions when:**\n- Building complex applications that rely heavily on server-side logic\n- You need durable, versioned code that survives restarts and failovers\n- Code sharing and reuse between functions is important\n- You want clearer debugging with named functions instead of SHA1 digests\n- Multiple applications need to use the same server-side logic\n- You're extending Redis with a richer API (similar to modules)\n\n### **Use Lua Scripts (EVAL) when:**\n- Lightweight, one-off scripting needs\n- Scripts are truly part of the application logic (not database extensions)\n- Simple conditional updates that don't require code reuse\n- You're on Redis versions before 7.0 (Functions not available)\n\n## Important Notes\n- Both execute atomically and block the server during execution\n- Both use the same Lua 5.1 interpreter and have access to the same Lua API\n- Functions don't support the Redis Lua debugger (scripts do)\n- As of Redis 7.0, Functions are the recommended approach for server-side programmability\n\n[来源:

demarcate between the programming language used for writing functions and their management by the server.\\\\\\\\nLua, the only language interpreter that Redis presently support as an embedded execution engine, is meant to be simple and easy to learn.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the choice of Lua as a language still presents many Redis users with a challenge.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Functions feature makes no assumptions about the implementation\\'s language.\\\\\\\\nAn execution engine that is part of the definition of the function handles running it.\\\\\\\\nAn engine can theoretically execute functions in any language as long as it respects several rules (such as the ability to terminate an executing function).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPresently, as noted above, Redis ships with a single embedded [Lua 5.1]() engine.\\\\\\\\nThere are plans to support additional engines in the future.\\\\\\\\nRedis functions can use all of Lua\\'s available capabilities to ephemeral scripts,\\\\\\\\nwith the only exception being the [Redis Lua scripts debugger]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions also simplify development by enabling code sharing.\\\\\\\\nEvery function belongs to a single library, and any given library can consist of multiple functions.\\\\\\\\nThe library\\'s contents are immutable, and selective updates of its functions aren\\'t allowed.\\\\\\\\nInstead, libraries are updated as a whole with all of their functions together in one operation.\\\\\\\\nThis allows calling functions from other functions within the same library, or sharing code between functions by using a common code in library-internal methods, that can also take language native arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions are intended to better support the use case of maintaining a consistent view for data entities through a logical schema, as mentioned above.\\\\\\\\nAs such, functions are stored alongside the data itself.\\\\\\\\nFunctions are also persisted to the AOF file and replicated from master to replicas, so they are as durable as the data itself.\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis is used as an ephemeral cache, additional mechanisms (described below) are required to make functions more durable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLike all other operations in Redis, the execution of a function is atomic.\\\\\\\\nA function\\'s execution blocks all server activities during its entire time, similarly to the semantics of [transactions]().\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\nThe blocking semantics of an executed function apply to all connected clients at all times.\\\\\\\\nBecause running a function blocks the Redis server, functions are meant to finish executing quickly, so you should avoid using long-running functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.8262,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a-002\\\\\",\\\\n

command.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as generic as possible and provide customized execution via their arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA script is loaded to the server\\'s cache by calling the [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() command and providing its source code.\\\\\\\\nThe server doesn\\'t execute the script, but instead just compiles and loads it to the server\\'s cache.\\\\\\\\nOnce loaded, you can execute the cached script with the SHA1 digest returned from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of loading and then executing a cached script:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Immabe a cached

This feature, which became available in Redis 7, supersedes the use of [EVAL]() in prior versions of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior versions of Redis made scripting available only via the [`EVAL`]() command, which allows a Lua script to be sent for execution by the server.\\\\\\\\nThe core use cases for [Eval Scripts]() is executing part of your application logic inside Redis, efficiently and atomically.\\\\\\\\nSuch script can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing [`EVAL`]() requires that the application sends the entire script for execution every time.\\\\\\\\nBecause this results in network and script compilation overheads, Redis provides an optimization in the form of the [`EVALSHA`]() command. By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes to already-established and well-liked ephemeral scripts, Redis v7.0 introduces Redis Functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.0461,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

replication**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:**\\\\\\\\nstarting with Redis 5.0, script effects replication is the default mode and does not need to be explicitly enabled.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this replication mode, while Lua scripts are executed, Redis collects all the commands executed by the Lua scripting engine that actually modify the dataset.\\\\\\\\nWhen the script execution finishes, the sequence of commands that the script generated are wrapped into a [`MULTI`]()/[`EXEC`]() [transaction]() and are sent to the replicas and AOF.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is useful in several ways depending on the use case:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When the script is slow to compute, but the effects can be summarized by a few write commands, it is a shame to re-compute the script on the replicas or when reloading the AOF.\\\\\\\\n  In this case, it is much better to replicate just the effects of the script.\\\\\\\\n* When script effects replication is enabled, the restrictions on non-deterministic functions are removed.\\\\\\\\n  You can, for example, use the [`TIME`]() or [`SRANDMEMBER`]() commands inside your scripts freely at any place.\\\\\\\\n* The Lua PRNG in this mode is seeded randomly on every call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnless already enabled by the server\\'s configuration or defaults (before Redis 7.0), you need to issue the following Lua command before the script performs a write:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.replicate_commands()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`redis.replicate_commands()`]() function returns _true) if script effects replication was enabled;\\\\\\\\notherwise, if the function was called after the script already called a write command,\\\\\\\\nit returns _false_, and normal whole script replication is used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis

here's how to benchmark Redis performance:\n\n## Primary Tool: redis-benchmark\n\nRedis includes a built-in utility called `redis-benchmark` that simulates running commands by N clients sending M total queries (similar to Apache's `ab` utility).\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -q -n 100000\n```\n\n### Key Options\n\n- `-h <hostname>` - Server hostname (default 127.0.0.1)\n- `-p <port>` - Server port (default 6379)\n- `-c <clients>` - Number of parallel connections (default 50)\n- `-n <requests>` - Total number of requests (default 100000)\n- `-d <size>` - Data size of SET/GET value in bytes (default 3)\n- `-t <tests>` - Only run specific tests (comma-separated)\n- `-P <numreq>` - Pipeline requests (default 1, no pipeline)\n- `-q` - Quiet mode, just show query/sec values\n- `--threads <num>` - Enable multi-thread mode\n\n### Example: Test Specific Commands\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -t set,lpush -n 100000 -q\n```\n\n### Example: Using Pipelining\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\n```\n\nPipelining can dramatically improve performance (e.g., from ~72K to 1.5M+ ops/sec for SET operations).\n\n## Alternative Third-Party Tools\n\n1. **memtier_benchmark** (from Redis Labs) - NoSQL Redis and Memcache traffic generation and benchmarking tool\n2. **rpc-perf** (from Twitter) - Benchmarking tool for RPC services supporting Redis and Memcache\n3. **YCSB** (from Yahoo) - Benchmarking framework with clients for many databases including Redis\n\n[来源:

In Redis the difference\\\\\\\\nbetween such a synthetic benchmark and a real one is not huge since it is an\\\\\\\\nin-memory system, however it is possible to stress cache misses and in general\\\\\\\\nto simulate a more real-world work load by using a large key space.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is obtained by using the `-r` switch. For instance if I want to run\\\\\\\\none million SET operations, using a random key for every operation out of\\\\\\\\n100k possible keys, I\\'ll use the following command line:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli flushall\\\\\\\\n    OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -t set -r 100000 -n 1000000\\\\\\\\n    ====== SET ======\\\\\\\\n      1000000 requests completed in 13.86 seconds\\\\\\\\n      50 parallel clients\\\\\\\\n      3 bytes payload\\\\\\\\n      keep alive: 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    99.76% `<=` 1 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    99.98% `<=` 2 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    72144.87 requests per second\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli dbsize\\\\\\\\n    (integer) 99993\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default every client (the benchmark simulates 50 clients if not otherwise\\\\\\\\nspecified with `-c`) sends the next command only when the reply of the previous\\\\\\\\ncommand is received, this means that the server will likely need a read call\\\\\\\\nin order to read each command from every client. Also RTT is paid as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis supports [pipelining](/topics/pipelining), so it is possible to send\\\\\\\\nmultiple commands at once, a feature often exploited by real world applications.\\\\\\\\nRedis pipelining is able to dramatically improve the number of operations per\\\\\\\\nsecond a server is able to deliver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of running the benchmark in a MacBook Air 11\\\\\\\\\\\\\" using a\\\\\\\\npipelining of 16 commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\\\\\\\\n    SET: 1536098.25 requests per second, p50=0.479 msec                     \\\\\\\\n    GET: 1811594.25 requests per second, p50=0.391 msec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining results in a significant increase in performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPitfalls and misconceptions\\\\\\\\n---------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first point is obvious: the golden rule of a useful benchmark is to\\\\\\\\nonly compare apples and apples. Different versions of Redis can be compared\\\\\\\\non the same workload for instance. Or the same version of Redis, but with\\\\\\\\ndifferent options. If you plan to compare Redis to something else, then it is\\\\\\\\nimportant to evaluate the functional and technical differences, and take them\\\\\\\\nin account.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is a server, hence, all commands involve network round trips. Embedded data stores do not involve network and protocol management. When comparing such products to Redis, command execution times should be used instead of end-to-end times.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis commands return an acknowledgment for all usual commands. Some other data stores do not. Comparing Redis to stores involving one-way queries is only mildly useful.\\\\\\\\n+ Naively iterating on synchronous Redis commands does not benchmark Redis itself, but rather measure your network (or IPC) latency and the client library intrinsic latency. To really test Redis, you need multiple connections (like redis-benchmark) and/or to use pipelining to aggregate several commands and/or multiple threads or processes.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is an in-memory data store with some optional persistence options. If you plan to compare it to transactional servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc ...), then you should consider activating AOF and decide on a suitable fsync policy.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is, mostly, a single-threaded server from the POV of commands execution (actually modern versions of Redis use threads for different things). It is not designed to benefit from multiple CPU cores. People are supposed to launch several Redis instances to scale out on several cores if needed. It is not really fair to compare one single Redis instance to a multi-threaded data store.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA common misconception is that redis-benchmark is designed to make Redis\\\\\\\\nperformances look stellar, the throughput achieved by redis-benchmark being\\\\\\\\nsomewhat artificial, and not achievable by a real application. This is\\\\\\\\nactually not true.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `redis-benchmark` program is a quick and useful way to get some figures and\\\\\\\\nevaluate the performance of a Redis instance on a given hardware. However,\\\\\\\\nby default, it does not represent the maximum throughput a Redis instance can\\\\\\\\nsustain. Actually, by using pipelining and a fast client (hiredis), it is fairly\\\\\\\\neasy to write a program generating more throughput than redis-benchmark. The\\\\\\\\ndefault behavior of redis-benchmark is to achieve throughput by exploiting\\\\\\\\nconcurrency only (i.e. it creates several connections to the server).\\\\\\\\nIt does not use pipelining or any parallelism at all (one pending query per\\\\\\\\nconnection at most, and no multi-threading), if not explicitly enabled via\\\\\\\\nthe `-P` parameter. So in some way using `redis-benchmark` and, triggering, for\\\\\\\\nexample, a `BGSAVE` operation in the background at the same time, will provide\\\\\\\\nthe user with numbers more near to the *worst case* than to the best case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo run a benchmark using pipelining mode (and achieve higher throughput),\\\\\\\\nyou need to explicitly use the -P option. Please note that it is still a\\\\\\\\nrealistic behavior since a lot of Redis based applications actively use\\\\\\\\npipelining to improve performance. However you should use a pipeline size that\\\\\\\\nis more or less the average pipeline length you\\'ll be able to use in your\\\\\\\\napplication in order to get realistic numbers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, the benchmark should apply the same operations, and work in the same way\\\\\\\\nwith the multiple data stores you want to compare. It is absolutely pointless to\\\\\\\\ncompare the result of redis-benchmark to the result of another benchmark\\\\\\\\nprogram and extrapolate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, Redis and memcached in single-threaded mode can be compared on\\\\\\\\nGET/SET operations. Both are in-memory data stores, working mostly in the same\\\\\\\\nway at the protocol level. Provided their respective benchmark application is\\\\\\\\naggregating queries in the same way (pipelining) and use a similar number of\\\\\\\\nconnections, the comparison is actually meaningful.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis perfect example is illustrated by the dialog between Redis (antirez) and\\\\\\\\nmemcached (dormando) developers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 1 - On Redis, Memcached, Speed, Benchmarks and The Toilet](http://antirez.com/post/redis-memcached-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[dormando - Redis VS Memcached (slightly better bench)](http://dormando.livejournal.com/525147.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 2 - An update on the Memcached/Redis benchmark](http://antirez.com/post/update-on-memcached-redis-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can see that in the end, the difference between the two solutions is not\\\\\\\\nso staggering, once all technical aspects are considered. Please note both\\\\\\\\nRedis and memcached have been optimized further after these benchmarks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, when very efficient servers are benchmarked (and stores like Redis\\\\\\\\nor memcached definitely fall in this category), it may be difficult to saturate\\\\\\\\nthe server. Sometimes, the performance bottleneck is on client side,\\\\\\\\nand not server-side. In that case, the client (i.e. the benchmark program itself)\\\\\\\\nmust be fixed, or perhaps scaled out, in order to reach the maximum throughput.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFactors impacting Redis performance\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are multiple factors having direct consequences on Redis performance.\\\\\\\\nWe mention them here, since they can alter the result of any benchmarks.\\\\\\\\nPlease note however, that a typical Redis instance running on a low end,\\\\\\\\nuntuned box usually provides good enough performance for most applications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Network bandwidth and latency usually have a direct impact on the performance.\\\\\\\\nIt is a good practice to use the ping program to quickly check the latency\\\\\\\\nbetween the client and server hosts is normal before launching the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nRegarding the bandwidth, it is generally useful to estimate\\\\\\\\nthe throughput in Gbit/s and compare it to the theoretical bandwidth\\\\\\\\nof the network. For instance a benchmark setting 4 KB strings\\\\\\\\nin Redis at 100000 q/s, would actually consume 3.2 Gbit/s of bandwidth\\\\\\\\nand probably fit within a 10 Gbit/s link, but not a 1 Gbit/s one. In many real\\\\\\\\nworld scenarios, Redis throughput is limited by the network well before being\\\\\\\\nlimited by the CPU. To consolidate several high-throughput Redis instances\\\\\\\\non a single server, it worth considering putting a 10 Gbit/s NIC\\\\\\\\nor multiple 1 Gbit/s NICs with TCP/IP bonding.\\\\\\\\n+ CPU is another very important factor. Being single-threaded, Redis favors\\\\\\\\nfast CPUs with large caches and not many cores. At this game, Intel CPUs are\\\\\\\\ncurrently the winners. It is not uncommon to get only half the performance on\\\\\\\\nan AMD Opteron CPU compared to similar Nehalem EP/Westmere EP/Sandy Bridge\\\\\\\\nIntel CPUs with Redis. When client and server run on the same box, the CPU is\\\\\\\\nthe limiting factor with redis-benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ Speed of RAM and memory bandwidth seem less critical for global performance\\\\\\\\nespecially for small objects. For large objects (>10 KB), it may become\\\\\\\\nnoticeable though. Usually, it is not really cost-effective to buy expensive\\\\\\\\nfast memory modules to optimize Redis.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis runs slower on a VM compared to running without virtualization using\\\\\\\\nthe same hardware. If you have the chance to run Redis on a physical machine\\\\\\\\nthis is preferred. However this does not mean that Redis is slow in\\\\\\\\nvirtualized environments, the delivered performances are still very good\\\\\\\\nand most of the serious performance issues you may incur in virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironments are due to over-provisioning, non-local disks with high latency,\\\\\\\\nor old hypervisor software that have slow `fork` syscall implementation.\\\\\\\\n+ When the server and client benchmark programs run on the same box, both\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback and unix domain sockets can be used. Depending on the\\\\\\\\nplatform, unix domain sockets can achieve around 50% more throughput than\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback (on Linux for instance). The default behavior of\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark is to use the TCP/IP loopback.\\\\\\\\n+ The performance benefit of unix domain sockets compared to TCP/IP loopback\\\\\\\\ntends to decrease when pipelining is heavily used (i.e. long pipelines).\\\\\\\\n+ When an ethernet network is used to access Redis, aggregating commands using\\\\\\\\npipelining is especially efficient when the size of the data is kept under\\\\\\\\nthe ethernet packet size (about 1500 bytes). Actually, processing 10 bytes,\\\\\\\\n100 bytes, or 1000 bytes queries almost result in the same throughput.\\\\\\\\nSee the graph below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Data size impact](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/client_command/topics/Data_size.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ On multi CPU sockets servers, Redis performance becomes dependent on the\\\\\\\\nNUMA configuration and process location. The most visible effect is that\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark results seem non-deterministic because client and server\\\\\\\\nprocesses are distributed randomly on the cores. To get deterministic results,\\\\\\\\nit is required to use process placement tools (on Linux: taskset or numactl).\\\\\\\\nThe most efficient combination is always to put the client and server on two\\\\\\\\ndifferent cores of the same CPU to benefit from the L3 cache.\\\\\\\\nHere are some results of 4 KB SET benchmark for 3 server CPUs (AMD Istanbul,\\\\\\\\nIntel Nehalem EX, and Intel Westmere) with different relative placements.\\\\\\\\nPlease note this benchmark is not meant to compare CPU models between themselves\\\\\\\\n(CPUs exact model and frequency are therefore not disclosed).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![NUMA chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/6374a07f93e867353e5e946c1e39a573dfc83f6c/topics/NUMA_chart.gif)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, the number of client connections is also an\\\\\\\\nimportant factor. Being based on epoll/kqueue, the Redis event loop is quite\\\\\\\\nscalable. Redis has already been benchmarked at more than 60000 connections,\\\\\\\\nand was still able to sustain 50000 q/s in these conditions. As a rule of thumb,\\\\\\\\nan instance with 30000 connections can only process half the throughput\\\\\\\\nachievable with 100 connections. Here is an example showing the throughput of\\\\\\\\na Redis instance per number of connections:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![connections chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/system_info/topics/Connections_chart.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, it is possible to achieve higher throughput by\\\\\\\\ntuning the NIC(s) configuration and associated interruptions. Best throughput\\\\\\\\nis achieved by setting an affinity between Rx/Tx NIC queues and CPU cores,\\\\\\\\nand activating RPS (Receive Packet Steering) support. More information in this\\\\\\\\n[thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/gUhc19gnYgc/BruTPCOroiMJ).\\\\\\\\nJumbo frames may also provide a performance boost when large objects are used.\\\\\\\\n+ Depending on the platform, Redis can be compiled against different memory\\\\\\\\nallocators (libc malloc, jemalloc, tcmalloc), which may have different behaviors\\\\\\\\nin term of raw speed, internal and external fragmentation.\\\\\\\\nIf you did not compile Redis yourself, you can use the INFO command to check\\\\\\\\nthe `mem_allocator` field. Please note most benchmarks do not run long enough to\\\\\\\\ngenerate significant external fragmentation (contrary to production Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOther things to consider\\\\\\\\n------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne important goal of any benchmark is to get reproducible results, so they\\\\\\\\ncan be compared to the results of other tests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ A good practice is to try to run tests on isolated hardware as much as possible.\\\\\\\\nIf it is not possible, then the system must be monitored to check the benchmark\\\\\\\\nis not impacted by some external activity.\\\\\\\\n+ Some configurations (desktops and laptops for sure, some servers as well)\\\\\\\\nhave a variable CPU core frequency mechanism. The policy controlling this\\\\\\\\nmechanism can be set at the OS level. Some CPU models are more aggressive than\\\\\\\\nothers at adapting the frequency of the CPU cores to the workload. To get\\\\\\\\nreproducible results, it is better to set the highest possible fixed frequency\\\\\\\\nfor all the CPU cores involved in the benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ An important point is to size the system accordingly to the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nThe system must have enough RAM and must not swap. On Linux, do not forget\\\\\\\\nto set the `overcommit_memory` parameter correctly. Please note 32 and 64 bit\\\\\\\\nRedis instances do not have the same memory footprint.\\\\\\\\n+ If you plan to use RDB or AOF for your benchmark, please check there is no other\\\\\\\\nI/O activity in the system. Avoid putting RDB or AOF files on NAS or NFS shares,\\\\\\\\nor on any other devices impacting your network bandwidth and/or latency\\\\\\\\n(for instance, EBS on Amazon EC2).\\\\\\\\n+ Set Redis logging level (loglevel parameter) to warning or notice. Avoid putting\\\\\\\\nthe generated log file on a remote filesystem.\\\\\\\\n+ Avoid using monitoring tools which can alter the result of the benchmark. For\\\\\\\\ninstance using INFO at regular interval to gather statistics is probably fine,\\\\\\\\nbut MONITOR will impact the measured performance significantly.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.5516,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search/query-performance-factor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Query Performance Factor\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Monitoring Redis Query Engine\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To monitor a database with a query performance factor configured:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

This setup requires no external API dependencies.\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### 1. Clone the Repository\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent\n```\n\n### 2. Install Dependencies\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 3. Set Up Qdrant Vector Database\n```bash\ndocker pull qdrant/qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\n### 4. Install Ollama and Pull Models\n```bash\n# Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/download\nollama pull llama3.2\nollama pull openhermes  # For embeddings\n```\n\n### 5. Run the RAG Agent\n```bash\npython local_rag_agent.py\n```\n\n### 6. Access the Interface\nOpen your browser to `http://localhost:7777` to interact with the agent through the AgentOS interface.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Fully local implementation** - No external API calls\n- **Vector search** using Qdrant for semantic retrieval\n- **Interactive web interface** via AgentOS\n- **Document management** using Agno v2.0 Knowledge class\n- **Automatic embedding generation** with OpenHermes\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Documents are loaded and chunked (the example uses a Thai Recipes PDF)\n2. Text chunks are converted to embeddings using OpenHermes\n3. Embeddings are stored in Qdrant vector database\n4. User queries are embedded and searched against the knowledge base\n5. Llama 3.2 generates answers based on retrieved context\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- The knowledge base loads documents on first run - comment out `knowledge_base.add_content()` after initial setup to avoid reloading\n- You can replace the sample PDF with your own documents\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent/README.md > 🦙 Local RAG Agent with

It allows for storage of vector embeddings and facilitates fast similarity searches, crucial for retrieving relevant information in RAG.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Popular AI frameworks**: Redis integrates seamlessly with various AI frameworks and tools. For instance, combining Redis with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) or [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/RedisIndexDemo/), libraries for building language models, enables developers to create sophisticated RAG pipelines. These integrations support efficient data management and building real-time LLM chains.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Spring AI and Redis**: Using [Spring AI with Redis](https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/) simplifies building RAG applications. Spring AI provides a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into applications, while Redis handles data management, ensuring the RAG pipeline is efficient and scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Embed and store data**: Convert your data into vector embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., BERT, GPT). Store these embeddings in Redis, where they can be quickly retrieved based on vector searches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Integrate with a generative model**: Use a generative AI model that can leverage the retrieved data. The model will use the vectors stored in Redis to augment its generation process, ensuring the output is informed by relevant, up-to-date information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Query and generate**: Implement the query logic to retrieve relevant vectors from Redis based on the input prompt. Feed these vectors into the generative model to produce augmented outputs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency**: The in-memory data store of Redis ensures that retrieval operations are performed with minimal latency.\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability**: Redis scales horizontally, seamlessly handling growing volumes of data and queries.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures and integrates with AI frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, Redis offers a powerful and efficient platform for implementing RAG. Its vector management capabilities, high performance, and seamless integration with AI frameworks make it an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI applications with real-time data retrieval.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4612,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"279a93cc\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"279a93cc-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_pdf/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Readme\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"📄 Chat with PDF > Interactive Application Demo\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**👉 [Click here to follow our complete step-by-step tutorial](https://www.theunwindai.com/p/build-an-llm-app-with-rag-using-llama-3-2-running-locally) and learn how to build this from scratch with detailed code walkthroughs, explanations, and best practices.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLLM app with RAG to chat with PDF in just 30 lines of Python Code.

This prevents irrelevant results from polluting the answer.\n\n2. **Query Transformation**: When retrieved documents aren't sufficient or relevant, the system optimizes and rewrites the query to improve search results. This helps overcome issues with poorly formulated queries.\n\n3. **Web Search Fallback**: If local documents don't contain adequate information (determined by the relevance grading), the system automatically falls back to web search (via Tavily API) to find additional relevant information.\n\n4. **Multi-Stage Workflow**: Uses LangGraph to orchestrate a corrective pipeline:\n   - Retrieve documents from vector store (Qdrant)\n   - Grade relevance of retrieved documents\n   - Transform query if needed\n   - Search web if local results insufficient\n   - Generate comprehensive answer\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n- **Smart Document Retrieval**: Qdrant vector store with OpenAI embeddings\n- **Multi-Model**: Combines OpenAI embeddings for retrieval and Claude 4.5 Sonnet for reasoning/grading\n- **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph manages the corrective decision flow\n\nThis approach addresses common RAG failures where irrelevant documents lead to hallucinations or incomplete answers, ensuring higher quality and more reliable responses.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md > 🔄 Corrective RAG Agent]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Read"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RAG", "local", "corrective", "retrieval", "reasoning"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Read"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "ce568412-7853-4569-82f0-9d65f02b7bec", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "f0b10213-dfc4-415d-a721-6abb72331c50", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Corrective RAG and how it improves retrieval quality.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_PPKlxv1xvaXYo8aG7avjvL', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Corrective RAG retrieval quality improvement', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_PPKlxv1xvaXYo8aG7avjvL', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.899,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"737a4dbf\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"737a4dbf-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"🔄 Corrective RAG Agent\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🔄 Corrective RAG Agent\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that implements a corrective multi-stage workflow using LangGraph.

Retrieval Stage (Finding Relevant Images)**\n- Images (or PDF pages) are converted to base64 strings\n- Each image is embedded using **Cohere's Embed-4 model** with multimodal capabilities (`input_type=\"search_document\"`)\n- When you ask a question, the text query is embedded using the same model (`input_type=\"search_query\"`)\n- **Cosine similarity** is calculated between the question embedding and all image embeddings\n- The most relevant image is retrieved based on the highest similarity score\n\n**2. Generation Stage (Answering Questions)**\n- The retrieved image and your text question are passed to **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**\n- Gemini analyzes the image content in context of the question\n- A textual answer is generated based on visual understanding\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **No OCR Required**: Directly processes complex images and visual elements without separate text extraction\n- **Flexible Content Sources**: Works with regular images (PNG, JPG) and PDF documents (automatically extracts pages as images)\n- **Multimodal Embeddings**: Uses Cohere Embed-4 for semantic matching between text queries and visual content\n- **Visual Question Answering**: Leverages Gemini's vision capabilities to understand charts, diagrams, tables, and infographics\n\n### Implementation Requirements\n\n```bash\n# Required APIs\n- Cohere API key (for Embed-4 multimodal embeddings)\n- Google Gemini API key (for visual question answering)\n\n# Setup\ngit clone

For example:\n   - **Redis + LangChain**: Use the [LangChain Redis integration](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) to create RAG pipelines\n   - **Qdrant + LangChain**: Qdrant can be used as the vector store with LangChain for document retrieval\n\n3. **Embed and Store Data**: \n   - Convert your documents into vector embeddings using models like BERT or GPT\n   - Store these embeddings in your vector database for fast retrieval\n\n4. **Integrate with a Generative Model**: Connect a generative AI model (like GPT, Gemini, or Cohere) that can leverage

Redis for RAG\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To build a RAG application with Redis, follow these general steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Set up Redis**: Start by setting up a Redis instance and configuring it to handle vector data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Use a Framework**:\\\\\\\\n    1. **Redis Vector Library (RedisVL)**: [RedisVL](https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redisvl/) enhances the development of generative AI applications by efficiently managing vectors and metadata. It allows for storage of vector embeddings and facilitates fast similarity searches, crucial for retrieving relevant information in RAG.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Popular AI frameworks**: Redis integrates seamlessly with various AI frameworks and tools. For instance, combining Redis with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) or [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/RedisIndexDemo/), libraries for building language models, enables developers to create sophisticated RAG pipelines. These integrations support efficient data management and building real-time LLM chains.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Spring AI and Redis**: Using [Spring AI with Redis](https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/) simplifies building RAG applications. Spring AI provides a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into applications, while Redis handles data management, ensuring the RAG pipeline is efficient and scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Embed and store data**: Convert your data into vector embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., BERT, GPT). Store these embeddings in Redis, where they can be quickly retrieved based on vector searches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Integrate with a generative model**: Use a generative AI model that can leverage the retrieved data. The model will use the vectors stored in Redis to augment its generation process, ensuring the output is informed by relevant, up-to-date information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Query and generate**: Implement the query logic to retrieve relevant vectors from Redis based on the input prompt. Feed these vectors into the generative model to produce augmented outputs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency**: The in-memory data store of Redis ensures that retrieval operations are performed with minimal latency.\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability**: Redis scales horizontally, seamlessly handling growing volumes of data and queries.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures and integrates with AI frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, Redis offers a powerful and efficient platform for implementing RAG. Its vector management capabilities, high performance, and seamless integration with AI frameworks make it an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI applications with real-time data retrieval.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.4292,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3c75fde5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3c75fde5-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/rag_agent_cohere/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG Agent with Cohere ⌘R\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG Agent with Cohere ⌘R\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A RAG Agentic system built with Cohere\\'s new model Command-r7b-12-2024, Qdrant for vector storage, Langchain for RAG and LangGraph for orchestration.

This creates a more natural, interactive experience similar to watching someone type in real-time.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Real-time AI Streaming**: Token-by-token response generation using OpenAI's streaming API\n- **Live State Management**: Conversation state updates in real-time with message history\n- **Event-driven Architecture**: Clean API → Event → Streaming Response flow\n- **Progressive Display**: Users see responses appear gradually instead of waiting for completion\n\n---\n\n## How to Build One\n\nThe implementation uses the **Motia framework** with just 3 core files:\n\n### Architecture\n```\nstreaming-ai-chatbot/\n├── steps/\n│   ├── conversation.stream.ts    # Real-time conversation state\n│   ├── chat-api.step.ts         # Simple chat API endpoint  \n│   └── ai-response.step.ts      # Streaming AI response handler\n├── package.json\n├── .env.example\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n1. **Install Dependencies**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_llm_apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_llms\nnpm install\n```\n\n2. **Configure OpenAI API**\n```bash\ncp .env.example .env\n# Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to .env\n```\n\n3. **Start Development Server**\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# Navigate to http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n### Core Implementation Concepts\n\n**1.

AI Finance Agent Team is a multi-agent system with specialized roles that work together to provide comprehensive financial analysis and recommendations.\n\n## System Architecture\n\n**Three Specialized Agents:**\n\n1. **Web Agent** - Handles general internet research for financial information\n2. **Finance Agent** - Performs detailed financial analysis using real-time data\n3. **Team Agent** - Coordinates between agents and orchestrates the workflow\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Real-time Financial Data Access** through YFinance API\n- **Web Search Capabilities** using DuckDuckGo for market research\n- **Persistent Storage** of agent interactions using SQLite\n- **Multi-agent coordination** for comprehensive financial insights\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Clone the repository:**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_finance_agent_team\n```\n\n2. **Install dependencies:**\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n3. **Set up OpenAI API key:**\n```bash\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'\n```\n\n4. **Run the agent team:**\n```bash\npython3 finance_agent_team.py\n```\n\n5. **Access the interface** through the web browser URL provided in the console to interact with the team through a playground interface.\n\n## Alternative: AI Financial Coach\n\nFor a more comprehensive personal finance solution, there's also an **AI Financial Coach Agent** that includes:\n- Budget Analysis Agent\n- Savings Strategy Agent  \n- Debt Reduction Agent\n- CSV expense tracking and visualization\n- Debt management with avalanche/snowball methods\n\n[来源:

It comes in two implementations:\n\n1. **Local Library** - Using `scrapegraphai` library (runs locally)\n2. **Cloud SDK** - Using ScrapeGraph AI API (managed service)\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/web_scrapping_ai_agent/README.md]\n\n### Advanced Web Scraping: Firecrawl\n\nFor more sophisticated use cases, several agents use **Firecrawl** (via MCP - Model Context Protocol) with these capabilities:\n\n**Core Tools:**\n- `firecrawl_scrape` - Extract clean content in Markdown format from single pages\n- `firecrawl_batch_scrape` - Efficient parallel processing for multiple URLs\n- `firecrawl_map` - Discover and list all available URLs on a site\n- `firecrawl_search` - Search for specific content and extract key information\n- `firecrawl_extract` - Extract structured data with custom schemas (e.g., product details)\n- `firecrawl_deep_research` - Multi-source analysis and synthesis\n- `firecrawl_crawl` - Crawl entire website sections with depth control\n\n**Example Applications:**\n- **AI Real Estate Agent Team** - Uses Firecrawl to scrape property listings from Zillow, Realtor.com, Trulia, and Homes.com\n- **AI Travel Planner** - Uses Firecrawl for web scraping travel information\n- **AI SEO Audit Team** - Uses Firecrawl MCP for accurate page scraping and competitive analysis\n\n[来源:

awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_real_estate_agent_team/README.md]\n\n### Integration Frameworks\n\nThese web scraping tools integrate with:\n- **Google ADK** (Agent Development Kit)\n- **LangChain** - For web search and research\n- **CrewAI** - For website scraping and file operations\n- **Agno framework** - For tool orchestration and multi-step workflows\n\n[来源:

Here's how to implement it:\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n**Use Mem0 + Qdrant Vector Store** for persistent memory management. This combination allows LLM applications to remember user preferences and conversation history across sessions.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Persistent storage** using Qdrant vector database\n- **User-specific conversation history** - each user gets isolated memory\n- **Memory retrieval** for contextual responses\n- **Cross-session persistence** - conversations survive app restarts\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n1. **Install dependencies:**\n```bash\npip install mem0 qdrant-client openai streamlit\n```\n\n2. **Start Qdrant vector store:**\n```bash\ndocker pull qdrant/qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \\\n    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \\\n    qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\n3. **Configure Mem0 with Qdrant:**\nThe app connects to Qdrant running on `localhost:6333` for memory storage and retrieval.\n\n4. **Implement memory operations:**\n   - Store user messages and preferences\n   - Retrieve relevant context before generating responses\n   - Maintain user-specific memory namespaces\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThe knowledge base includes three working examples:\n\n1. **Multi-LLM app with shared memory** - supports GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet with persistent memory\n2. **Personalized LLM app** - remembers user preferences across sessions\n3. **AI Travel Agent** - maintains travel preferences and past conversation context\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/multi_llm_memory/README.md > 🧠 Multi-LLM App with Shared Memory > How to get Started?]\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/llm_app_personalized_memory/README.md > 🧠 LLM App with Memory > How to get Started?]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/llm_app_personalized_memory/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/multi_llm_memory/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/ai_travel_agent_memory/README.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["agent", "travel", "memory", "personalized", "persistent", "RAG"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/llm_app_personalized_memory/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/multi_llm_memory/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/ai_travel_agent_memory/README.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "fe3810e8-8c81-428d-8fde-b3d340f1a785", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "63902827-42fe-4737-a9d7-750f0db4747e", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about adding persistent memory to LLM applications.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_C25aznGkpqilvgkGYwiYIS', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'persistent memory LLM application', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_uvEhf4gMrNxAZDzydPVTxP', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'persistent.*memory|memory.*persist|conversation.*history|chat.*history'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_C25aznGkpqilvgkGYwiYIS', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.0483,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"445440eb\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"445440eb-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/multi_llm_memory/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Readme\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🧠 Multi-LLM App with Shared Memory > How to get Started?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- Support for multiple LLMs:\\\\\\\\n    -

Each agent has a distinct role and outputs to Google Docs for collaborative content creation.\n\n### The Four Specialized Agents\n\n**1. 🧠 Professor Agent (Content Creator)**\n- Creates the fundamental knowledge base\n- Organizes content with proper headings and sections\n- Provides detailed explanations and examples\n- Output: Comprehensive knowledge base document with table of contents\n\n**2. 🗺️ Academic Advisor Agent (Learning Path Designer)**\n- Designs structured learning paths\n- Creates progressive milestone markers\n- Includes time estimates and prerequisites\n- Output: Visual roadmap document with clear progression paths\n\n**3. 📚 Research Librarian Agent (Resource Curator)**\n- Compiles and organizes learning resources\n- Links to academic papers and tutorials\n- Adds descriptions and difficulty ratings\n- Output: Categorized resource list with quality assessments\n\n**4. ✍️ Teaching Assistant Agent (Practice Designer)**\n- Develops interactive exercises\n- Creates structured practice sections with solution guides\n- Output: Complete practice workbook with answers\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n**Required Components:**\n- OpenAI API (for LLM capabilities)\n- Composio API (for Google Docs integration)\n- SerpAPI (for web search/resource gathering)\n- Streamlit (for user interface)\n\n**Setup Steps:**\n1. Clone the repository and install dependencies\n2. Configure API keys (OpenAI, Composio, SerpAPI)\n3. Connect Composio with Google Docs via OAuth2\n4. Run the Streamlit application\n\n**User Workflow:**\n- Enter a topic to learn (e.g., \"Python Programming\", \"Machine Learning\")\n- Click \"Generate Learning Plan\"\n- Agents collaborate to create comprehensive educational materials\n- Results are generated in Google Docs for easy sharing and editing\n\n### Key Design Patterns\n\nThis implementation demonstrates:\n- **Agent specialization** - each agent has a focused role\n- **Collaborative output** - agents work together through shared documents\n- **Tool integration** - uses external services (Google Docs) for persistence\n- **Progressive learning design** - structured from fundamentals to practice\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_teaching_agent_team/README.md]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Read", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_finance_agent_team/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_teaching_agent_team/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/ai_agent_framework_crash_course/openai_sdk_crash_course/9_multi_agent_orchestration/README.md"], "contexts_count": 3, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["agent", "team", "document", "web", "teaching", "education"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Read", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_finance_agent_team/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_teaching_agent_team/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/ai_agent_framework_crash_course/openai_sdk_crash_course/9_multi_agent_orchestration/README.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "ed445089-e217-441b-841e-bb2ddc8807a6", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "917aa9e0-4590-4941-9586-c007ce4fb5ab", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about building AI teaching agent teams for education.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_4ov3hoUeeo4s6BvB6q1zME', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'AI teaching agent team education multi-agent system', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_Gr7WsMjeCqezRb9iqzaoLq', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'teaching.*agent|education.*agent|multi.*agent.*team'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_4ov3hoUeeo4s6BvB6q1zME', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.7157,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"73cde3ed\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"73cde3ed-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_finance_agent_team/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Readme\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"💲 AI Finance Agent Team with Web Access > How to get Started?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- Multi-agent system with specialized roles:\\\\\\\\n    -

The knowledge base contains several implementations using Google's Gemini models.\n\n## Key Components\n\n**1. Core Capabilities**\n- Video analysis (MP4, MOV, AVI formats)\n- Image processing and visual understanding\n- Web research integration\n- Real-time processing\n- Combined visual and textual analysis\n\n**2. Technology Stack**\n- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash/Pro (supports multimodal inputs)\n- **Framework**: Phidata for agent orchestration\n- **Frontend**: Streamlit\n- **Image Processing**: Pillow\n- **Search**: DuckDuckGo API\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n**Basic Multimodal Agent:**\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd ai_agent_tutorials/multimodal_ai_agent\n\n# 2. Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# 3. Get Gemini API key\n# Sign up at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n\n# 4. Set environment variable\nexport GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n\n# 5. Run the app\nstreamlit run multimodal_agent.py\n```\n\n**Advanced Multi-Agent Team:**\n\nFor more complex use cases like design analysis, you can build a team of specialized agents:\n\n- **Visual Design Agent**: Evaluates design elements, color schemes, typography\n- **UX Analysis Agent**: Assesses user flows, interaction patterns, accessibility\n- **Market Analysis Agent**: Provides market insights and competitor analysis\n\n```bash\ncd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/multimodal_design_agent_team\npip install -r requirements.txt\nstreamlit run design_agent_team.py\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Upload clear, high-resolution images/videos\n- Provide context about your use case and target audience\n- For comparative analysis, include multiple views or competitor examples\n- Use structured output formats for actionable insights\n\n## Available Examples\n\nThe knowledge base includes several multimodal agent implementations:\n- Multimodal Coding Agent Team\n- Multimodal Design Agent Team\n- Multimodal UI/UX Feedback Agent Team\n- Gemini Multimodal Agent Demo\n\n[来源:

It depicts the potential of Agno as a team of collaborative agents working together seamlessly in order to address a real-world challenge - analyzing speech presentations by users and providing them with comprehensive evaluation and feedback to improve their public speaking skills. Each individual agent has a clear cut goal to follow and together they coordinate as a team to solve a complex multimodal problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- This project has a huge potential for further enhancements. It could be a starting point for a more comprehensive and useful agentic systsem. Some of the proposed additional functionalities could be:\\\\\\\\n  1. Incorporating real-time video recording and conversational capabilities through different role scenarios.\\\\\\\\n  2. Playing back the user speech through an AI avatar to help users learn and understand best speaking practices.\\\\\\\\n  3. Keeping a record of user sessions.\\\\\\\\n  4. Including a performance dashboard to track user performance over time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Each of these additional functionalities could be added by implementing specific goal-oriented agents in the system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Together API** with **meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free** as LLM has a small token limit, therefore, it works with small video clips (15-30 seconds).\\\\\\\\n- Use other LLM options for longer video clips.

However, I can provide guidance based on the multi-agent patterns and GitHub integration examples found in the knowledge base.\n\n## Building an AI Code Reviewer Agent\n\nWhile there's no specific code reviewer tutorial in the knowledge base, you can build one using the multi-agent patterns and GitHub integration capabilities documented. Here's how:\n\n### Key Components from the Knowledge Base\n\n**1. GitHub Integration via MCP**\n\nThe Multi-MCP Intelligent Assistant demonstrates GitHub integration capabilities:\n- Repository management (create, clone, fork, search)\n- Issue & PR workflow (create, update, review, merge, comment)\n- Code analysis capabilities\n- Interactive CLI with streaming responses\n\n[Source: awesome-llm-apps/mcp_ai_agents/multi_mcp_agent/README.md]\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Architecture Pattern**\n\nThe Legal Agent Team provides a good template for specialized review agents:\n- Multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyst, Strategist)\n- Team Lead coordinator that orchestrates between agents\n- Document analysis with specific section references\n- Comprehensive reporting\n\n[Source: awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_legal_agent_team/README.md]\n\n### Recommended Approach\n\nTo build a code reviewer agent, combine these patterns:\n\n**Agent Team Structure:**\n1. **Code Analyzer Agent** - Reviews code quality, patterns, and structure\n2. **Security Reviewer Agent** - Identifies security vulnerabilities\n3. **Best Practices Agent** - Checks adherence to coding standards\n4. **Team Lead** - Coordinates analysis and generates comprehensive review\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n\n```bash\n# Setup with GitHub MCP integration\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd mcp_ai_agents/multi_mcp_agent\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**Required API Keys:**\n- OpenAI API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\n- GitHub Personal Access Token: https://github.com/settings/tokens (with `repo` scope)\n\n[Source: awesome-llm-apps/mcp_ai_agents/github_mcp_agent/README.md]\n\n### Alternative: Use Agent Framework Tutorials\n\nThe knowledge base includes framework crash courses (Google ADK, LangChain, CrewAI) that show how to build multi-agent systems with third-party tools, which could be adapted for code review workflows.\n\n[Source: awesome-llm-apps/ai_agent_framework_crash_course/google_adk_crash_course/]\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The knowledge base doesn't contain a ready-made code reviewer agent implementation. You'll need to adapt the multi-agent patterns and GitHub MCP integration examples to build your specific use case.", "tools_used": ["Glob", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"],

Sentinel 触发主从切换（failover）后，原来的主节点可能变成从节点，而从节点默认是只读的（`replica-read-only yes`）。如果应用没有及时更新连接，仍然向旧的主节点（现在是从节点）发送写命令，就会报这个错误。\n\n## 解决方案\n\n### 1. 应用层重连（推荐）\n\n确保应用正确处理 Sentinel 的主节点切换：\n\n- 使用支持 Sentinel 的 Redis 客户端（如 Jedis、Lettuce、ioredis）\n- 客户端会自动订阅 Sentinel 的 `+switch-master` 事件并重建连接\n- 实现重试机制：捕获 `READONLY` 错误后触发连接池刷新\n\n### 2. 检查 Sentinel 配置\n\n确认 Sentinel 正确配置了主节点信息：\n\n```bash\n# 查看当前主节点\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n\n# 查看 Sentinel 日志确认切换事件\ngrep \"+switch-master\" /var/log/redis/sentinel.log\n```\n\n### 3. 临时应急（不推荐生产环境）\n\n如果需要临时允许从节点写入（会导致数据不一致）：\n\n```bash\nredis-cli CONFIG SET replica-read-only no\n```\n\n但这会破坏主从数据一致性，仅用于紧急恢复。\n\n### 4. 手动切换回主节点\n\n如果确认切换是误触发，可以手动切回：\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster\n```\n\n## 预防措施\n\n- 监控 Sentinel 的 `+switch-master` 事件\n- 应用层实现连接健康检查\n- 设置合理的 `down-after-milliseconds` 避免误切换\n- 使用连接池的自动重连机制\n\n[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md >

pre-loaded. Common reasons for that could be:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Starting Redis in a new environment\\\\\\\\n* Re-starting an ephemeral (cache-only) Redis, that uses functions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, we need to make sure that the pre-loaded functions are available before Redis accepts inbound user connections and commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo do that, it is possible to use `redis-cli --functions-rdb` to extract the functions from an existing server. This generates an RDB file that can be loaded by Redis at startup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis needs to have some information about how a function is going to behave when executed, in order to properly enforce resource usage policies and maintain data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, Redis needs to know that a certain function is read-only before permitting it to execute using [`FCALL_RO`]() on a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all functions may perform arbitrary read or write operations. Function Flags make it possible to declare more specific function behavior at the time of registration. Let\\'s see how this works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our previous example, we defined two functions that only read data. We can try executing them using [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis > FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n(error) ERR Can not execute a function with write flag using fcall_ro.\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis returns this error because a function can, in theory, perform both read and write operations on the database.\\\\\\\\nAs a safeguard and by default, Redis assumes that the function does both, so it blocks its execution.\\\\\\\\nThe server will reply with this error in the following cases:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Executing a function with [`FCALL`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n2. Using [`FCALL_RO`]() to execute a function.\\\\\\\\n3. A disk error was detected (Redis is unable to persist so it rejects writes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn these cases, you can add the `no-writes` flag to the function\\'s registration, disable the safeguard and allow them to run.\\\\\\\\nTo register a function with flags use the [named arguments]() variant of `redis.register_function`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe updated registration code snippet from the library looks like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function(\\'my_hset\\', my_hset)\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hgetall\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hgetall,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hlastmodified\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hlastmodified,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce we\\'ve replaced the library, Redis allows running both `my_hgetall` and `my_hlastmodified` with [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"myfield\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"some value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_field\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hlastmodified 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1640772721\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the complete documentation flags, please refer to [Script flags]().\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.5417,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Read-only replica\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Since Redis 2.6, replicas support a read-only mode that is enabled by default.\\\\\\\\nThis behavior is controlled by the `replica-read-only` option in the redis.conf file, and can be enabled and disabled at runtime using [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRead-only replicas will reject all write commands, so that it is not possible to write to a replica because of a mistake. This does not mean that the feature is intended to expose a replica instance to the internet or more generally to a network where untrusted clients exist, because administrative commands like [`DEBUG`](/commands/debug) or [`CONFIG`](/commands/config) are still enabled. The [Security]() page describes how to secure a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may wonder why it is possible to revert the read-only setting\\\\\\\\nand have replica instances that can be targeted by write operations.\\\\\\\\nThe answer is that writable replicas exist only for historical reasons.\\\\\\\\nUsing writable replicas can result in inconsistency between the master and the replica, so it is not recommended to use writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nTo understand in which situations this can be a problem, we need to understand how replication works.\\\\\\\\nChanges on the master is replicated by propagating regular Redis commands to the replica.\\\\\\\\nWhen a key expires on the master, this is propagated as a DEL command.\\\\\\\\nIf a key which exists on the master but is deleted, expired or has a different type on the replica compared to the master will react differently to commands like DEL, INCR or RPOP propagated from the master than intended.\\\\\\\\nThe propagated command may fail on the replica or result in a different outcome.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risks (if you insist on using writable replicas) we suggest you follow these recommendations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t write to keys in a writable replica that are also used on the master.\\\\\\\\n  (This can be hard to guarantee if you don\\'t have control over all the clients that write to the master.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica as an intermediary step when upgrading a set of instances in a running system.\\\\\\\\n  In general, don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica if it can ever be promoted to a master if you want to guarantee data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHistorically, there were some use cases that were considered legitimate for writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, these use cases are now all obsolete and the same can be achieved by other means.\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Computing slow Set or Sorted set operations and storing the result in temporary local keys using commands like [`SUNIONSTORE`](/commands/sunionstore) and [`ZINTERSTORE`](/commands/zinterstore).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use commands that return the result without storing it, such as [`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and [`ZINTER`](/commands/zinter).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using the [`SORT`](/commands/sort) command (which is not considered a read-only command because of the optional STORE option and therefore cannot be used on a read-only replica).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`SORT_RO`](/commands/sort_ro), which is a read-only command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using [`EVAL`](/commands/eval) and [`EVALSHA`](/commands/evalsha) are also not considered read-only commands, because the Lua script may call write commands.\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`EVAL_RO`](/commands/eval_ro) and [`EVALSHA_RO`](/commands/evalsha_ro) where the Lua script can only call read-only commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile writes to a replica will be discarded if the replica and the master resync or if the replica is restarted, there is no guarantee that they will sync automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore version 4.0, writable replicas were incapable of expiring keys with a time to live set.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if you use [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) or other commands that set a maximum TTL for a key, the key will leak, and while you may no longer see it while accessing it with read commands, you will see it in the count of keys and it will still use memory.\\\\\\\\nRedis 4.0 RC3 and greater versions are able to evict keys with TTL as masters do, with the exceptions of keys written in DB numbers greater than 63 (but by default Redis instances only have 16 databases).\\\\\\\\nNote though that even in versions greater than 4.0, using [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) on a key that could ever exists on the master can cause inconsistency between the replica and the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that since Redis 4.0 replica writes are only local, and are not propagated to sub-replicas attached to the instance. Sub-replicas instead will always receive the replication stream identical to the one sent by the top-level master to the intermediate replicas. So for example in the following setup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    A ---> B ---> C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if `B` is writable, C will not see `B` writes and will instead have identical dataset as the master instance `A`.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.1019,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Lua API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"_redis_ object {#redis_object} > `redis.register_function` {#redis.register_function} > Script flags {#script_flags}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Important:**\\\\\\\\nUse script flags with care, which may negatively impact if misused.\\\\\\\\nNote that the default for Eval scripts are different than the default for functions that are mentioned below, see [Eval Flags]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you register a function or load an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nThis results in the following behavior:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. They can read and write data.\\\\\\\\n1. They can run in cluster mode, and are not able to run commands accessing keys of different hash slots.\\\\\\\\n1. Execution against a stale replica is denied to avoid inconsistent reads.\\\\\\\\n1. Execution under low memory is denied to avoid exceeding the configured threshold.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can use the following flags and instruct the server to treat the scripts\\' execution differently:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `no-writes`: this flag indicates that the script only reads data but never writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    By default, Redis will deny the execution of flagged scripts (Functions and Eval scripts with [shebang]()) against read-only replicas, as they may attempt to perform writes.\\\\\\\\n    Similarly, the server will not allow calling scripts with [`FCALL_RO`]() / [`EVAL_RO`]().\\\\\\\\n    Lastly, when data persistence is at risk due to a disk error, execution is blocked as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Using this flag allows executing the script:\\\\\\\\n    1. With [`FCALL_RO`]() / [`EVAL_RO`]()\\\\\\\\n    2. On read-only replicas.\\\\\\\\n    3. Even if there\\'s a disk error (Redis is unable to persist so it rejects writes).\\\\\\\\n    4. When over the memory limit since it implies the script doesn\\'t increase memory consumption (see `allow-oom` below)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    However, note that the server will return an error if the script attempts to call a write command.\\\\\\\\n    Also note that currently [`PUBLISH`](), [`SPUBLISH`]() and [`PFCOUNT`]() are also considered write commands in scripts, because they could attempt to propagate commands to replicas and AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    For more information please refer to [Read-only scripts]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `allow-oom`: use this flag to allow a script to execute when the server is out of memory (OOM).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Unless used, Redis will deny the execution of flagged scripts (Functions and Eval scripts with [shebang]()) when in an OOM state.\\\\\\\\n    Furthermore, when you use this flag, the script can call any Redis command, including commands that aren\\'t usually allowed in this state.\\\\\\\\n    Specifying `no-writes` or using [`FCALL_RO`]() / [`EVAL_RO`]() also implies the script can run in OOM state (without specifying `allow-oom`)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `allow-stale`: a flag that enables running the flagged scripts (Functions and Eval scripts with [shebang]()) against a stale replica when the `replica-serve-stale-data` config is set to `no` .\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Redis can be set to prevent data consistency problems from using old data by having stale replicas return a runtime error.\\\\\\\\n    For scripts that do not access the data, this flag can be set to allow stale Redis replicas to run the script.\\\\\\\\n    Note however that the script will still be unable to execute any command that accesses stale data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `no-cluster`: the flag causes the script to return an error in Redis cluster mode.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Redis allows scripts to be executed both in standalone and cluster modes.\\\\\\\\n    Setting this flag prevents executing the script against nodes in the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `allow-cross-slot-keys`: The flag that allows a script to access keys from multiple slots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Redis typically prevents any single command from accessing keys that hash to multiple slots.\\\\\\\\n    This flag allows scripts to break this rule and access keys within the script that access multiple slots.\\\\\\\\n    Declared keys to the script are still always required to hash to a single slot.\\\\\\\\n    Accessing keys from multiple slots is discouraged as applications should be designed to only access keys from a single slot at a time, allowing slots to move between Redis servers.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    This flag has no effect when cluster mode is disabled.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to [Function Flags]() and [Eval Flags]() for

\\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel API > Sentinel commands\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The `SENTINEL` command is the main API for Sentinel. The following is the list of its subcommands (minimal version is noted for where applicable):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG GET `<name>`** (`>= 6.2`) Get the current value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter. The specified name may be a wildcard, similar to the Redis [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG SET `<name>` `<value>`** (`>= 6.2`) Set the value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CKQUORUM `<master name>`** Check if the current Sentinel configuration is able to reach the quorum needed to failover a master, and the majority needed to authorize the failover. This command should be used in monitoring systems to check if a Sentinel deployment is ok.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FLUSHCONFIG** Force Sentinel to rewrite its configuration on disk, including the current Sentinel state. Normally Sentinel rewrites the configuration every time something changes in its state (in the context of the subset of the state which is persisted on disk across restart). However sometimes it is possible that the configuration file is lost because of operation errors, disk failures, package upgrade scripts or configuration managers. In those cases a way to force Sentinel to rewrite the configuration file is handy. This command works even if the previous configuration file is completely missing.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FAILOVER `<master name>`** Force a failover as if the master was not reachable, and without asking for agreement to other Sentinels (however a new version of the configuration will be published so that the other Sentinels will update their configurations).\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL GET-MASTER-ADDR-BY-NAME `<master name>`** Return the ip and port number of the master with that name. If a failover is in progress or terminated successfully for this master it returns the address and port of the promoted replica.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL INFO-CACHE** (`>= 3.2`) Return cached [`INFO`](/commands/info) output from masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR <ip> <port> <current-epoch> <runid>** Check if the master specified by ip:port is down from current Sentinel\\'s point of view. This command is mostly for internal use.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTER `<master name>`** Show the state and info of the specified master.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTERS** Show a list of monitored masters and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MONITOR** Start Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MYID** (`>= 6.2`) Return the ID of the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL PENDING-SCRIPTS** This command returns information about pending scripts.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REMOVE** Stop Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REPLICAS `<master name>`** (`>= 5.0`) Show a list of replicas for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SENTINELS `<master name>`** Show a list of sentinel instances for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SET** Set Sentinel\\'s monitoring configuration. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SIMULATE-FAILURE (crash-after-election|crash-after-promotion|help)** (`>= 3.2`) This command simulates different Sentinel crash scenarios.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL RESET `<pattern>`** This command will reset all the masters with matching name. The pattern argument is a glob-style pattern. The reset process clears any previous state in a master (including a failover in progress), and removes every replica and sentinel already discovered and associated with the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor connection management and administration purposes, Sentinel supports the following subset of Redis\\' commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **ACL** (`>= 6.2`) This command manages the Sentinel Access Control List. For more information refer to the [ACL]() documentation page and the [_Sentinel Access Control List authentication_](#sentinel-access-control-list-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **AUTH** (`>= 5.0.1`) Authenticate a client connection. For more information refer to the [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command and the [_Configuring Sentinel instances with authentication_ section](#configuring-sentinel-instances-with-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **CLIENT** This command manages client connections. For more information refer to its subcommands\\' pages.\\\\\\\\n* **COMMAND** (`>= 6.2`) This command returns information about commands. For more information refer to the [`COMMAND`](/commands/command) command and its various subcommands.\\\\\\\\n* **HELLO** (`>= 6.0`) Switch the connection\\'s protocol. For more information refer to the [`HELLO`](/commands/hello) command.\\\\\\\\n* **INFO** Return information and statistics about the Sentinel server. For more information see the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command.\\\\\\\\n* **PING** This command simply returns PONG.\\\\\\\\n* **ROLE** This command returns the string \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a list of monitored masters. For more information refer to the [`ROLE`](/commands/role) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SHUTDOWN** Shut down the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, Sentinel also supports the [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe), [`UNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/unsubscribe), [`PSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/psubscribe) and [`PUNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/punsubscribe) commands. Refer to the [_Pub/Sub Messages_ section](#pubsub-messages) for more details.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.2356,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"A quick tutorial > Testing the failover\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"At this point our toy Sentinel deployment is ready to be tested.

token**：\n   - `access_token`：有效期 15 分钟，用于日常 API 请求\n   - `refresh_token`：有效期 7 天，用于换取新的 access token\n\n2. **自动续期流程**：\n   - 当 API 返回 `401 TOKEN_EXPIRED` 错误时\n   - 客户端自动调用 `/api/v1/auth/refresh`，携带 refresh_token\n   - 服务端返回新的 access_token 和 refresh_token（旧的立即失效）\n   - 客户端用新 token 重试刚才失败的请求\n\n### 客户端实现示例\n\n```javascript\n// 拦截器自动处理 token 过期\naxios.interceptors.response.use(\n  response => response,\n  async error => {\n    if (error.response?.status === 401 && \n        error.response?.data?.code === 'TOKEN_EXPIRED') {\n      \n      // 用 refresh token 换取新 token\n      const { access_token, refresh_token } = await refreshToken();\n      \n      // 保存新 token\n      localStorage.setItem('access_token', access_token);\n      localStorage.setItem('refresh_token', refresh_token);\n      \n      // 重试原请求\n      error.config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${access_token}`;\n      return axios.request(error.config);\n    }\n    return Promise.reject(error);\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### 关键点\n\n- **用户无感知**：整个续期过程在后台自动完成，用户不需要重新登录\n- **安全性**：refresh_token 单次使用后立即轮换，防止重放攻击\n- **只有 7 天不活跃才需要重新登录**：只要在 7 天内使用过系统，就能一直保持登录状态\n\n[来源: docs/api/authentication.md > 登录流程 &

However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel.

For example, to upgrade the Redis process of one of the\\\\\\\\nmaster nodes it is a good idea to failover it to turn it into a replica\\\\\\\\nwith minimal impact on availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are supported by Redis Cluster using the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)\\\\\\\\ncommand, that must be executed in one of the replicas of the master you want\\\\\\\\nto failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are special and are safer compared to failovers resulting from\\\\\\\\nactual master failures. They occur in a way that avoids data loss in the\\\\\\\\nprocess, by switching clients from the original master to the new master only\\\\\\\\nwhen the system is sure that the new master processed all the replication stream\\\\\\\\nfrom the old one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what you see in the replica log when you perform a manual failover:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Manual failover user request accepted.\\\\\\\\n    # Received replication offset for paused master manual failover: 347540\\\\\\\\n    # All master replication stream processed, manual failover can start.\\\\\\\\n    # Start of election delayed for 0 milliseconds (rank #0, offset 347540).\\\\\\\\n    # Starting a failover election for epoch 7545.\\\\\\\\n    # Failover election won: I\\'m the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically clients connected to the master we are failing over are stopped.\\\\\\\\nAt the same time the master sends its replication offset to the replica, that\\\\\\\\nwaits to reach the offset on its side. When the replication offset is reached,\\\\\\\\nthe failover starts, and the old master is informed about the configuration\\\\\\\\nswitch. When the clients are unblocked on the old master, they are redirected\\\\\\\\nto the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTo promote a replica to master, it must first be known as a replica by a majority of the masters in the cluster.\\\\\\\\n  Otherwise, it cannot win the failover election.\\\\\\\\n  If the replica has just been added to the cluster (see [Add a new node as a replica](#add-a-new-node-as-a-replica)), you may need to wait a while before sending the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover) command, to make sure the masters in cluster are aware of the new replica.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.3485,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-022\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > SDOWN and ODOWN failure state\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel has two different concepts of *being down*, one is called\\\\\\\\na *Subjectively Down* condition (SDOWN) and is a down condition that is\\\\\\\\nlocal to a given Sentinel instance. Another is called *Objectively Down*\\\\\\\\ncondition (ODOWN) and is reached when enough Sentinels (at least the\\\\\\\\nnumber configured as the `quorum` parameter of the monitored master) have\\\\\\\\nan SDOWN condition, and get feedback from other Sentinels using\\\\\\\\nthe `SENTINEL is-master-down-by-addr` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of a Sentinel an SDOWN condition is reached when it\\\\\\\\ndoes not receive a valid reply to PING requests for the number of seconds\\\\\\\\nspecified in the configuration as `is-master-down-after-milliseconds`\\\\\\\\nparameter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn acceptable reply to PING is one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with +PONG.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -LOADING error.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -MASTERDOWN error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAny other reply (or no reply at all) is considered non valid.\\\\\\\\nHowever note that **a logical master that advertises itself as a replica in\\\\\\\\nthe INFO output is considered to be down**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that SDOWN requires that no acceptable reply is received for the whole\\\\\\\\ninterval configured, so for instance if the interval is 30000 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n(30 seconds) and we receive an acceptable ping reply every 29 seconds, the\\\\\\\\ninstance is considered to be working.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSDOWN is not enough to trigger a failover: it only means a single Sentinel\\\\\\\\nbelieves a Redis instance is not available. To trigger a failover, the\\\\\\\\nODOWN state must be reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo switch from SDOWN to ODOWN no strong consensus algorithm is used, but\\\\\\\\njust a form of gossip: if a given Sentinel gets reports that a master\\\\\\\\nis not working from enough Sentinels **in a given time range**, the SDOWN is\\\\\\\\npromoted to ODOWN. If this acknowledge is later missing, the flag is cleared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA more strict authorization that uses an actual majority is required in\\\\\\\\norder to really start the failover, but no failover can be triggered without\\\\\\\\nreaching the ODOWN state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ODOWN condition **only applies to masters**. For other kind of instances\\\\\\\\nSentinel doesn\\'t require to act, so the ODOWN state is never reached for replicas\\\\\\\\nand other sentinels, but only SDOWN is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever SDOWN has also semantic implications. For example a replica in SDOWN\\\\\\\\nstate is not selected to be promoted by a Sentinel performing a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels and replicas auto discovery\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels stay connected with other Sentinels in order to reciprocally\\\\\\\\ncheck the availability of each other, and to exchange messages. However you\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t need to configure a list of other Sentinel addresses in every Sentinel\\\\\\\\ninstance you run, as Sentinel uses the Redis instances Pub/Sub capabilities\\\\\\\\nin order to discover the other Sentinels that are monitoring the same masters\\\\\\\\nand replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is implemented by sending *hello messages* into the channel named\\\\\\\\n`__sentinel__:hello`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly you don\\'t need to configure what is the list of the replicas attached\\\\\\\\nto a master, as Sentinel will auto discover this list querying Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel publishes a message to every monitored master and replica Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello`, every two seconds, announcing its presence with ip, port, runid.\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel is subscribed to the Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello` of every master and replica, looking for unknown sentinels. When new sentinels are detected, they are added as sentinels of this master.\\\\\\\\n* Hello messages also include the full current configuration of the master. If the receiving Sentinel has a configuration for a given master which is older than the one received, it updates to the new configuration immediately.\\\\\\\\n* Before adding a new sentinel to a master a Sentinel always checks if there is already a sentinel with the same runid or the same address (ip and port pair). In that case all the matching sentinels are removed, and the new added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel reconfiguration of instances outside the failover procedure\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven when no failover is in progress, Sentinels will always try to set the\\\\\\\\ncurrent configuration on monitored instances. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Replicas (according to the current configuration) that claim to be masters, will be configured as replicas to replicate with the current master.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas connected to a wrong master, will be reconfigured to replicate with the right master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinels to reconfigure replicas, the wrong configuration must be observed for some time, that is greater than the period used to broadcast new configurations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis prevents Sentinels with a stale configuration (for example because they just rejoined from a partition) will try to change the replicas configuration before receiving an update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note how the semantics of always trying to impose the current configuration makes the failover more resistant to partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Masters failed over are reconfigured as replicas when they return available.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas partitioned away during a partition are reconfigured once reachable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe important lesson to remember about this section is: **Sentinel is a system where each process will always try to impose the last logical configuration to the set of monitored instances**.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.1484,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Test the failover\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To trigger the failover, the simplest thing we can do (that is also\\\\\\\\nthe semantically simplest failure that can occur in a distributed system)\\\\\\\\nis to crash a single process, in our case a single master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nDuring this test, you should take a tab open with the consistency test\\\\\\\\napplication running.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can identify a master and crash it with the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes | grep master\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385482984082 0 connected 5960-10921\\\\\\\\n2938205e12de373867bf38f1ca29d31d0ddb3e46 127.0.0.1:7002 master - 0 1385482983582 0 connected 11423-16383\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOk, so 7000, 7001, and 7002 are masters.

This may\\\\\\\\nsound unexpected as in the first part of this tutorial we stated that Redis\\\\\\\\nCluster can lose writes during the failover because it uses asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication. What we did not say is that this is not very likely to happen\\\\\\\\nbecause Redis sends the reply to the client, and the commands to replicate\\\\\\\\nto the replicas, about at the same time, so there is a very small window to\\\\\\\\nlose data. However the fact that it is hard to trigger does not mean that it\\\\\\\\nis impossible, so this does not change the consistency guarantees provided\\\\\\\\nby Redis cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can now check what is the cluster setup after the failover (note that\\\\\\\\nin the meantime I restarted the crashed instance so that it rejoins the\\\\\\\\ncluster as a replica):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes\\\\\\\\n3fc783611028b1707fd65345e763befb36454d73 127.0.0.1:7004 slave 3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 0 1385503418521 0 connected\\\\\\\\na211e242fc6b22a9427fed61285e85892fa04e08 127.0.0.1:7003 slave 97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 0 1385503419023 0 connected\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 127.0.0.1:7005 master - 0 1385503419023 3 connected 11423-16383\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385503417005 0 connected 5960-10921\\\\\\\\n2938205e12de373867bf38f1ca29d31d0ddb3e46 127.0.0.1:7002 slave 3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 0 1385503418016 3 connected\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow the masters are running on ports 7000, 7001 and 7005.

get-master-addr-by-name <master-name>`）\n- 每次重连时（超时、socket 错误、显式关闭等），客户端会重新向 Sentinel 查询最新的 master 地址\n- Redis 2.8.12+ 在 failover 后会向所有客户端发送 `CLIENT KILL type normal` 命令，强制客户端断开并重新解析地址\n- 客户端通过 `ROLE` 命令验证连接的实例角色，避免连接到过期的 master\n\n## 2. 直连 master IP（需要手动干预）\n\n如果应用直连 master IP，需要手动操作：\n\n```bash\n# 1. 获取新 master 地址\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n\n# 2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\n\n# 3. 滚动重启应用\nkubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\n```\n\n## 3. 连接池的处理\n\n对于实现了连接池的客户端：\n- 单个连接重连时，应重新联系 Sentinel 获取地址\n- 如果 master 地址变更，应关闭所有现有连接并连接到新地址\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 恢复操作 > 手动恢复]**  \n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md > Redis service

Since Sentinel is both responsible\\\\\\\\nfor reconfiguring instances during failovers, and providing configurations to\\\\\\\\nclients connecting to Redis masters or replicas, clients are required to have\\\\\\\\nexplicit support for Redis Sentinel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis document is targeted at Redis clients developers that want to support Sentinel in their clients implementation with the following goals:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Automatic configuration of clients via Sentinel.\\\\\\\\n* Improved safety of Redis Sentinel automatic failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor details about how Redis Sentinel works, please check the [Redis Documentation](), as this document only contains information needed for Redis client developers, and it is expected that readers are familiar with the way Redis Sentinel works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel identifies every master with a name like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stats\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\nEvery name actually identifies a *group of instances*, composed of a master\\\\\\\\nand a variable number of replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe address of the Redis master that is used for a specific purpose inside a network may change after events like an automatic failover, a manually triggered failover (for instance in order to upgrade a Redis instance), and other reasons.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally Redis clients have some kind of hard-coded configuration that specifies the address of a Redis master instance within a network as IP address and port number. However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel. So instead of a hard coded IP address and port, a client supporting Sentinel should optionally be able to take as input:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A list of ip:port pairs pointing to known Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* The name of the service, like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"timelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the procedure a client should follow in order to obtain the master address starting from the list of Sentinels and the service name.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.1823,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel as a distributed system\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel provides high availability for Redis when not using [Redis Cluster](). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel also provides other collateral tasks such as monitoring,\\\\\\\\nnotifications and acts as a configuration provider for clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the full list of Sentinel capabilities at a macroscopic level (i.e. the *big picture*):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Monitoring**. Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties. In this document concepts will be introduced gradually\\\\\\\\nstarting from basic information needed in order to understand the basic\\\\\\\\nproperties of Sentinel, to more complex information (that are optional) in\\\\\\\\norder to understand how exactly Sentinel works.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.1794,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Error reporting\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Once the service name is resolved into the master address and a connection is established with the Redis master instance, every time a reconnection is needed, the client should resolve again the address using Sentinels restarting from Step 1. For instance Sentinel should contacted again the following cases:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If the client reconnects after a timeout or socket error.\\\\\\\\n* If the client reconnects because it was explicitly closed or reconnected by the user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above cases and any other case where the client lost the connection with the Redis server, the client should resolve the master address again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStarting with Redis 2.8.12, when Redis Sentinel changes the configuration of\\\\\\\\nan instance, for example promoting a replica to a master, demoting a master to\\\\\\\\nreplicate to the new master after a failover, or simply changing the master\\\\\\\\naddress of a stale replica instance, it sends a `CLIENT KILL type normal`\\\\\\\\ncommand to the instance in order to make sure all the clients are disconnected\\\\\\\\nfrom the reconfigured instance. This will force clients to resolve the master\\\\\\\\naddress again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the client will contact a Sentinel with yet not updated information, the verification of the Redis instance role via the [`ROLE`]() command will fail, allowing the client to detect that the contacted Sentinel provided stale information, and will try again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: it is possible that a stale master returns online at the same time a client contacts a stale Sentinel instance, so the client may connect with a stale master, and yet the ROLE output will match. However when the master is back again Sentinel will try to demote it to replica, triggering a new disconnection. The same reasoning applies to connecting to stale replicas that will get reconfigured to replicate with a different master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes clients are interested to connect to replicas, for example in order to scale read requests. This protocol supports connecting to replicas by modifying step 2 slightly. Instead of calling the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name master-name\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe clients should call instead:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    SENTINEL replicas master-name\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to retrieve a list of replica instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSymmetrically the client should verify with the [`ROLE`]() command that the\\\\\\\\ninstance is actually a replica, in order to avoid scaling read queries with\\\\\\\\nthe master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor clients implementing connection pools, on reconnection of a single connection, the Sentinel should be contacted again, and in case of a master address change all the existing connections should be closed and connected to the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client should correctly return the information to the user in case of errors. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If no Sentinel can be contacted (so that the client was never able to get the reply to `SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name`), an error that clearly states that Redis Sentinel is unreachable should be returned.\\\\\\\\n* If all the Sentinels in the pool replied with a null reply, the user should be informed with an error that Sentinels don\\'t know this master name.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.9592,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-028\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Algorithms and internals > Consistency under partitions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel configurations are eventually consistent, so every partition will\\\\\\\\nconverge to the higher configuration available.\\\\\\\\nHowever in a real-world system using Sentinel there are three different players:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* Clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to define the behavior of the system we have to consider all three.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is a simple network where there are 3 nodes, each running\\\\\\\\na Redis instance, and a Sentinel instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n                +-------------+\\\\\\\\n                | Sentinel 1  |----- Client A\\\\\\\\n                | Redis 1 (M) |\\\\\\\\n                +-------------+\\\\\\\\n                        |\\\\\\\\n                        |\\\\\\\\n    +-------------+     |          +------------+\\\\\\\\n    | Sentinel 2  |-----+-- // ----| Sentinel 3 |----- Client B\\\\\\\\n    | Redis 2 (S) |                | Redis 3 (M)|\\\\\\\\n    +-------------+                +------------+\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this system the original state was that Redis 3 was the master, while\\\\\\\\nRedis 1 and 2 were replicas. A partition occurred isolating the old master.\\\\\\\\nSentinels 1 and 2 started a failover promoting Sentinel 1 as the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Sentinel properties guarantee that Sentinel 1 and 2 now have the new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration for the master. However Sentinel 3 has still the old configuration\\\\\\\\nsince it lives in a different partition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe know that Sentinel 3 will get its configuration updated when the network\\\\\\\\npartition will heal, however what happens during the partition if there\\\\\\\\nare clients partitioned with the old master?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients will be still able to write to Redis 3, the old master. When the\\\\\\\\npartition will rejoin, Redis 3 will be turned into a replica of Redis 1, and\\\\\\\\nall the data written during the partition will be lost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDepending on your configuration you may want or not that this scenario happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a cache, it could be handy that Client B is still able to write to the old master, even if its data will be lost.\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a store, this is not good and you need to configure the system in order to partially prevent this problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis is asynchronously replicated, there is no way to totally prevent data loss in this scenario, however you can bound the divergence between Redis 3 and Redis 1\\\\\\\\nusing the following Redis configuration option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration the Redis 3 in the above example will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel 3 configuration will converge to\\\\\\\\nthe new one, and Client B will be able to fetch a valid configuration and continue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general Redis + Sentinel as a whole are an **eventually consistent system** where the merge function is **last failover wins**, and the data from old masters are discarded to replicate the data of the current master, so there is always a window for losing acknowledged writes. This is due to Redis asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication and the discarding nature of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merge function of the system. Note that this is not a limitation of Sentinel itself, and if you orchestrate the failover with a strongly consistent replicated state machine, the same properties will still apply. There are only two ways to avoid losing acknowledged writes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Use synchronous replication (and a proper consensus algorithm to run a replicated state machine).\\\\\\\\n2. Use an eventually consistent system where different versions of the same object can be merged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis currently is not able to use any of the above systems, and is currently outside the development goals. However there are proxies implementing solution \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on top of Redis stores such as SoundCloud [Roshi](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi), or Netflix [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel persistent state\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel state is persisted in the sentinel configuration file. For example\\\\\\\\nevery time a new configuration is received, or created (leader Sentinels), for\\\\\\\\na master, the configuration is persisted on disk together with the configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch.

failover（`CLUSTER FAILOVER` 命令）是**安全的，不会丢失数据**。系统会确保新 master 处理完旧 master 的所有复制流后，才切换客户端连接。\n\n但**自动 failover**（Sentinel 触发）可能丢失少量数据，因为：\n- 主从复制是异步的，master 宕机时可能有部分写入未同步到 replica\n- 切换过程中的写入请求可能失败\n\n## 如何保证数据一致性？\n\n### 1. 使用 Sentinel 客户端（关键）\n- 应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel）\n- **禁止直连 master IP**，否则 failover 后应用仍连接旧 master，导致写入失败\n\n### 2. 连接池配置\n- 开启 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置，确保连接可用性\n- 配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`，及时清理失效连接\n\n### 3. 手动 failover（推荐用于运维操作）\n如果是计划内的主从切换（如升级），使用手动 failover：\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster\n```\n手动 failover 会等待复制流同步完成，**避免数据丢失**。\n\n### 4. 定期演练\n定期执行 failover 演练，验证应用层的自动切换能力。\n\n[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 概述、恢复操作、预防措施]  \n[来源: Redis Cluster 官方文档 > Manual failover]",

actually causing any problem\\\\\\\\non a master. For example, to upgrade the Redis process of one of the\\\\\\\\nmaster nodes it is a good idea to failover it to turn it into a replica\\\\\\\\nwith minimal impact on availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are supported by Redis Cluster using the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)\\\\\\\\ncommand, that must be executed in one of the replicas of the master you want\\\\\\\\nto failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are special and are safer compared to failovers resulting from\\\\\\\\nactual master failures. They occur in a way that avoids data loss in the\\\\\\\\nprocess, by switching clients from the original master to the new master only\\\\\\\\nwhen the system is sure that the new master processed all the replication stream\\\\\\\\nfrom the old one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what you see in the replica log when you perform a manual failover:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Manual failover user request accepted.\\\\\\\\n    # Received replication offset for paused master manual failover: 347540\\\\\\\\n    # All master replication stream processed, manual failover can start.\\\\\\\\n    # Start of election delayed for 0 milliseconds (rank #0, offset 347540).\\\\\\\\n    # Starting a failover election for epoch 7545.\\\\\\\\n    # Failover election won: I\\'m the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically clients connected to the master we are failing over are stopped.\\\\\\\\nAt the same time the master sends its replication offset to the replica, that\\\\\\\\nwaits to reach the offset on its side. When the replication offset is reached,\\\\\\\\nthe failover starts, and the old master is informed about the configuration\\\\\\\\nswitch. When the clients are unblocked on the old master, they are redirected\\\\\\\\nto the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTo promote a replica to master, it must first be known as a replica by a majority of the masters in the cluster.\\\\\\\\n  Otherwise, it cannot win the failover election.\\\\\\\\n  If the replica has just been added to the cluster (see [Add a new node as a replica](#add-a-new-node-as-a-replica)), you may need to wait a while before sending the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover) command, to make sure the masters in cluster are aware of the new replica.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_jnQH8lZnMDBg3ojWreGUAi', name='Read', input={'file_path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/runbook/redis-failover.md'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_jnQH8lZnMDBg3ojWreGUAi', content=\"     1→---\\n     2→id: redis-failover-001\\n     3→title: Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\n     4→owner: sre-team\\n     5→tags: [redis, failover, runbook, 高可用]\\n     6→created: 2025-02-13\\n     7→last_reviewed: 2025-02-13\\n     8→confidence: high\\n     9→---\\n    10→\\n    11→# Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\n    12→\\n    13→## 概述\\n    14→\\n    15→当 Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换（failover）后，应用层需要正确处理连接重建。本文档描述完整的故障恢复流程。\\n    16→\\n    17→## 故障现象\\n    18→\\n    19→- 应用日志出现大量 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\\n    20→- Sentinel 日志显示 `+switch-master` 事件\\n    21→- 监控告警：Redis 写入延迟突增\\n    22→\\n    23→## 排查步骤\\n    24→\\n    25→### 1. 确认 Sentinel 状态\\n    26→\\n    27→```bash\\n    28→redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n    29→redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n    30→```\\n    31→\\n    32→确认新 master 的 IP 和端口。\\n    33→\\n    34→### 2. 检查新 master 状态\\n    35→\\n    36→```bash\\n    37→redis-cli -h <new-master-ip> -p 6379 INFO replication\\n    38→```\\n    39→\\n    40→确认 `role:master`，检查 `connected_slaves` 数量。\\n    41→\\n    42→### 3. 检查应用连接池\\n    43→\\n    44→确认应用是否已经切换到新 master：\\n    45→\\n    46→```bash\\n    47→# 查看应用连接数\\n    48→redis-cli -h <new-master-ip> CLIENT LIST | wc -l\\n    49→```\\n    50→\\n    51→## 恢复操作\\n    52→\\n    53→### 自动恢复（推荐）\\n    54→\\n    55→如果应用使用 Sentinel 客户端（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会自动切换。检查：\\n    56→\\n    57→1. 确认客户端配置了 Sentinel 地址而非直连 master\\n    58→2. 确认连接池的 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置已开启\\n    59→3. 等待 30 秒，观察错误率是否下降\\n    60→\\n    61→### 手动恢复\\n    62→\\n    63→如果应用直连 master IP：\\n    64→\\n    65→1. 获取新 master 地址：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\\n    66→2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\\n    67→3. 滚动重启应用 Pod\\n    68→\\n    69→```bash\\n    70→kubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\\n    71→```\\n    72→\\n    73→## 预防措施\\n    74→\\n    75→- 所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\\n    76→- 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\\n    77→- 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\\n    78→\\n    79→## 相关文档\\n    80→\\n    81→- Redis Sentinel 架构设计\\n    82→- 应用连接池配置规范\\n    83→\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.
