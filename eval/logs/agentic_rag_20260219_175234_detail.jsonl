This will change the command reply.\\\\\\\\n             e.g., HGETALL returns a map instead of a flat array.\\\\\\\\n    * `0` -- Return the reply in auto mode, i.e. the reply format will be the\\\\\\\\n             same as the client attached to the given RedisModuleCtx.

If there is an error before\\\\\\\\n             invoking the command, the error is returned using errno mechanism.\\\\\\\\n             This flag allows to get the error also as an error CallReply with\\\\\\\\n             relevant error message.\\\\\\\\n    * \\'D\\' -- A \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dry Run\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mode. Return before executing the underlying call().\\\\\\\\n             If everything succeeded, it will return with a NULL, otherwise it will\\\\\\\\n             return with a CallReply object denoting the error, as if it was called with\\\\\\\\n             the \\'E\\' code.\\\\\\\\n    * \\'K\\' -- Allow running blocking commands. If enabled and the command gets blocked, a\\\\\\\\n             special REDISMODULE_REPLY_PROMISE will be returned. This reply type\\\\\\\\n             indicates that the command was blocked and the reply will be given asynchronously.\\\\\\\\n             The module can use this reply object to set a handler which will be called when\\\\\\\\n             the command gets unblocked using RedisModule_CallReplyPromiseSetUnblockHandler.\\\\\\\\n             The handler must be set immediately after the command invocation (without releasing\\\\\\\\n             the Redis lock in between). If the handler is not set, the blocking command will\\\\\\\\n             still continue its execution but the reply will be ignored (fire and forget),\\\\\\\\n             notice that this is dangerous in case of role change, as explained below.\\\\\\\\n             The module can use RedisModule_CallReplyPromiseAbort to abort the command invocation\\\\\\\\n             if it was not yet finished (see RedisModule_CallReplyPromiseAbort documentation for more\\\\\\\\n             details). It is also the module\\'s responsibility to abort the execution on role change, either by using\\\\\\\\n             server event (to get notified when the instance becomes a replica) or relying on the disconnect\\\\\\\\n             callback of the original client. Failing to do so can result in a write operation on a replica.\\\\\\\\n             Unlike other call replies, promise call reply **must** be freed while the Redis GIL is locked.\\\\\\\\n             Notice that on unblocking, the only promise is that the unblock handler will be called,\\\\\\\\n             If the blocking RedisModule_Call caused the module to also block some real client (using RedisModule_BlockClient),\\\\\\\\n             it is the module responsibility to unblock this client on the unblock handler.\\\\\\\\n             On the unblock handler it is only allowed to perform the following:\\\\\\\\n             * Calling additional Redis commands using RedisModule_Call\\\\\\\\n             * Open keys using RedisModule_OpenKey\\\\\\\\n             * Replicate data to the replica or AOF\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n             Specifically, it is not allowed to call any Redis module API which are client related such as:\\\\\\\\n             * RedisModule_Reply* API\\'s\\\\\\\\n             * RedisModule_BlockClient\\\\\\\\n             * RedisModule_GetCurrentUserName\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **...**: The actual arguments to the Redis command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn success a `RedisModuleCallReply` object is returned, otherwise\\\\\\\\nNULL is returned and errno is set to the following values:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* EBADF: wrong format specifier.\\\\\\\\n* EINVAL: wrong command arity.\\\\\\\\n* ENOENT: command does not exist.\\\\\\\\n* EPERM: operation in Cluster instance with key in non local slot.\\\\\\\\n* EROFS: operation in Cluster instance when a write command is sent\\\\\\\\n         in a readonly state.\\\\\\\\n* ENETDOWN: operation in Cluster instance when cluster is down.\\\\\\\\n* ENOTSUP: No ACL user for the specified module context\\\\\\\\n* EACCES: Command cannot be executed, according to ACL rules\\\\\\\\n* ENOSPC: Write or deny-oom command is not allowed\\\\\\\\n* ESPIPE: Command not allowed on script mode\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample code fragment:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n     reply = RedisModule_Call(ctx,\\\\\\\\\\\\\"INCRBY\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"sc\\\\\\\\\\\\\",argv[1],\\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n     if (RedisModule_CallReplyType(reply) == REDISMODULE_REPLY_INTEGER) {\\\\\\\\n       long long myval = RedisModule_CallReplyInteger(reply);\\\\\\\\n       // Do something with myval.\\\\\\\\n     }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis API is documented here: [https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/modules/](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/modules/)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<span id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"RedisModule_CallReplyProto\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></span>\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"agent_hint\\\\\": \\\\\"[reference | gaps:missing_example]\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"evidence_flags\\\\\": {\\\\n      \\\\\"has_command\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_config\\\\\": true,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_code_block\\\\\": true,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_steps\\\\\": false\\\\n    }\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.5675,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c0d5e595\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c0d5e595-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 1,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"../my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/gears-v1/python/recipes/write-behind.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Write Behind\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Install the write-behind recipe > Import requirements\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If you want to do write-behind with an Oracle database:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.
