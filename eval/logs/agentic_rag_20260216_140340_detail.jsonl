For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3277,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis set is an unordered collection of unique strings (members).\\\\\\\\nYou can use Redis sets to efficiently:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Track unique items (e.g., track all unique IP addresses accessing a given blog post).\\\\\\\\n* Represent relations (e.g., the set of all users with a given role).\\\\\\\\n* Perform common set operations such as intersection, unions, and differences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`SADD`]() adds a new member to a set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SREM`]() removes the specified member from the set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SISMEMBER`]() tests a string for set membership.\\\\\\\\n* [`SINTER`]() returns the set of members that two or more sets have in common (i.e., the intersection).\\\\\\\\n* [`SCARD`]() returns the size (a.k.a. cardinality) of a set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of set commands](?group=set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Store the sets of bikes racing in France and the USA.

For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_45BecS2idXZuochIRdz8lD', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='## Redis Sorted Sets vs Regular Sets\\n\\n**Key Differences:**\\n\\n1. **Ordering**\\n   - **Sets**: Unordered collection of unique strings\\n   - **Sorted Sets**: Ordered collection of unique strings, sorted by an associated score\\n\\n2. **Score Association**\\n   - **Sets**: Members have no associated values\\n   - **Sorted Sets**: Each member is associated with a floating-point score that determines its position\\n\\n3. **Sorting Behavior**\\n   - **Sets**: No inherent order; members are stored without any sequence\\n   - **Sorted Sets**: Members are automatically sorted by score (ascending).

It's designed for message queuing and event streaming use cases.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md > Data type features]\n\n### Adding Messages to a Stream\n\nUse the `XADD` command to add entries to a stream:\n\n```\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\n```\n\nThe `*` tells Redis to auto-generate a unique ID for each message based on timestamp.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/triggers/Stream_Triggers.md > Register a stream consumer]\n\n### Idempotent Message Processing (Redis 8.6+)\n\nFor reliable message delivery with automatic deduplication, Redis 8.6 introduced idempotent message processing:\n\n```\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # Manual producer and message IDs\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value        # Auto-generated message ID\n```\n\nThis prevents duplicate entries when producers need to retry sending messages due to network issues or crashes.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/streams/idempotency.md > Idempotency modes]\n\n### Consumer Groups\n\nThe knowledge base mentions `XREADGROUP` with a new `CLAIM` option (Redis 8.4+) for reading both idle pending and incoming stream entries, but detailed consumer group documentation isn't available in the current search results.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.4-release-notes.md]\n\n### Reading from Streams\n\nRedis 7.4+ introduced the ability to start reading from the last stream message using `XREAD` with the new ID value `+`.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.4-release-notes.md]\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **Note**: The knowledge base contains limited tutorial content on Redis Streams basics.

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.501,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"It\\'s not just a matter of RTT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Request/Response server can be implemented so that it is able to process new requests even if the client hasn\\'t already read the old responses.\\\\\\\\nThis way it is possible to send *multiple commands* to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use for many decades.\\\\\\\\nFor instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has supported pipelining since its early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.\\\\\\\\nThis is an example using the raw netcat utility:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash \\\\\\\\n$ (printf \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; sleep 1) | nc localhost 6379\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time we don\\'t pay the cost of RTT for every call, but just once for the three commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be explicit, with pipelining the order of operations of our very first example will be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the client sends commands using pipelining, the server will be forced to queue the replies, using memory. So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.0149,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"76ce88f3-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/streams/idempotency.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotent message processing\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Idempotency modes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when using at-least-once delivery patterns.

Producer-Redis network issues (disconnection and reconnection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If a disconnection occurs after the producer executes `XADD`, but before it receives the reply, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The producer crashes and restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If the producer crashes after calling `XADD` but before receiving the reply and marking a message as delivered, after a restart, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases, to guarantee that the message is added to the stream, the producer must call `XADD` again with the same message. Without idempotent message processing, a retry may result in a message being delivered twice. With idempotent message processing, producers can guarantee at-most-once production even under such scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA unique ID, called an idempotent ID or *iid*, is associated with each message that is added to a stream. \\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to assign iids:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

\\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Data Structures**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Hash`: Redis now supports expiration of individual hash fields. Redis already supports key expiration. For each key, users can specify a time when it should expire, or specify the remaining time-to-live (TTL) after which it would expire. One very frequent request was to allow specifying expiration time or TTL also for individual hash fields, which is now supported using nine new Redis commands:\\\\\\\\n- `HEXPIRE`, `HPEXPIRE`, `HEXPIREAT`, `HPEXPIREAT` - set the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields. \\\\\\\\n- `HTTL`, `HPTTL`, `HEXPIRETIME`, `HPEXPIRETIME` - retrieve the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields\\\\\\\\n- `HPERSIST` - remove the expiration of specific hash fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Streams`: It is now possible to start reading from the last stream message using `XREAD` with the new id value `+`.\\\\\\\\nThere are many additional improvements, including new command arguments, security, performance, and resource utilization enhancements, several new metrics and configuration parameters were introduced, and multiple bugs were fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Time series`: The latest time series data structure adds a highly requested feature: insertion-filter for close samples. Many sensors report data periodically. Often, the difference between the measured value and the previously measured value is negligible and related to random noise or to measurement accuracy limitations. When both the time difference and the value difference between the current and the previous sample are small, it may be preferable to ignore (not to add) the new measurement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`JSON`: Introduces a fix to avoid duplicating AOF commands multiple times in `JSON.MSET`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Probabilistic`: Now, an error is returned if `CMS.MERGE` results in an overflow or underflow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and query**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- New `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` vector data types reduce memory consumed by vectors while preserving accuracy.\\\\\\\\n- Support for indexing empty and missing values and enhanced developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities.\\\\\\\\n- Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax simpler.\\\\\\\\n- Geospatial search capabilities have been expanded with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, and ergonomics have been improved by providing better reporting of the memory consumed by the index and exposing the Full-text scoring in the aggregation pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf one or more fields of a hash key expire after a query begins (using FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE), Redis does not account for these lazily expired fields. As a result, keys with expired fields may still be included in the query results, leading to potentially incorrect or inconsistent results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Removal of triggers and functions**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Stack 7.4 will no longer include triggers and functions. To ensure a seamless upgrade, remove any T&F functions created before loading an RDB file into the new Redis Stack.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.7719,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0904b4cf\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0904b4cf-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/redis-in-ai.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis In Ai\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Use Cases in GenAI Apps > Advancing Natural Language Processing\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis improves session persistence and caching for conversational agents managing high interaction volumes.

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

This feature enables reliable message submission with automatic deduplication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdempotent message processing ensures that handling the same message multiple times produces the same system state as handling it once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeginning with Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when producers resend messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProducers may need to resend messages under two scenarios:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producer-Redis network issues (disconnection and reconnection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If a disconnection occurs after the producer executes `XADD`, but before it receives the reply, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The producer crashes and restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If the producer crashes after calling `XADD` but before receiving the reply and marking a message as delivered, after a restart, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases, to guarantee that the message is added to the stream, the producer must call `XADD` again with the same message. Without idempotent message processing, a retry may result in a message being delivered twice. With idempotent message processing, producers can guarantee at-most-once production even under such scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA unique ID, called an idempotent ID or *iid*, is associated with each message that is added to a stream. \\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to assign iids:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producers provide a unique iid for each message. An iid can be some identifier already associated with this message: a transaction ID, a counter, or a UUID.\\\\\\\\n1. Redis generates an iid based on each message’s content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the same message is added to the stream more than once, the same iid would need to be provided by the producer.\\\\\\\\nFor (1), this is the producer’s responsibility, and for (2), Redis will calculate the same iid, as long as the message content hasn’t changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the [`XADD`]() command with idempotency parameters, `IDMP` or `IDMPAUTO`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # producer-1 (pid) and iid-1 (iid) are provided manually\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value        # producer-2 (pid) is provided manually, Redis provides the iid\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Let me search for the core Redis Streams data type documentation that should cover the basic usage patterns.')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_ifnTlDZIRM8r2QAY0CSTvL', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Streams data type introduction overview', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_ifnTlDZIRM8r2QAY0CSTvL', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.4037,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redistimeseries 1.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.0.0 (June 2019) > Features\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In RedisTimeSeries, we are introducing a new data type that uses chunks of memory of fixed size for time series samples, indexed by the same [Radix Tree implementation](https://github.com/antirez/rax) as Redis Streams.

For example, for a desired false positive rate of 0.1% (1 in 1000), error_rate should be set to 0.001.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the number of items you expect having in your filter in total and is trivial when you have a static set but it becomes more challenging when your set grows over time. It\\'s important to get the number right because if you **oversize** - you\\'ll end up wasting memory. If you **undersize**, the filter will fill up and a new one will have to be stacked on top of it (sub-filter stacking). In the cases when a filter consists of multiple sub-filters stacked on top of each other latency for adds stays the same, but the latency for presence checks increases. The reason for this is the way the checks work: a regular check would first be performed on the top (latest) filter and if a negative answer is returned the next one is checked and so on. That\\'s where the added latency comes from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding an item to a Bloom filter never fails due to the data structure \\\\\\\\\\\\\"filling up\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Instead, the error rate starts to grow. To keep the error close to the one set on filter initialization, the Bloom filter will auto-scale, meaning, when capacity is reached, an additional sub-filter will be created.  \\\\\\\\n The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by `EXPANSION`. If the number of items to be stored in the filter is unknown, we recommend that you use an expansion of 2 or more to reduce the number of sub-filters. Otherwise, we recommend that you use an expansion of 1 to reduce memory consumption. The default expansion value is 2. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n The filter will keep adding more hash functions for every new sub-filter in order to keep your desired error rate. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMaybe you\\'re wondering \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why would I create a smaller filter with a high expansion rate if I know I\\'m going to scale anyway?\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; the answer is: for cases where you need to keep many filters (let\\'s say a filter per user, or per product) and most of them will stay small, but some with more activity will have to scale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you know you\\'re not going to scale use the `NONSCALING` flag because that way the filter will use one hash function less. Just remember that if you ever do reach the initially assigned capacity - your error rate will start to grow.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.4508,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Open Source that enables you to check if an element is present in a set using a very small memory space of a fixed size.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInstead of storing all the items in a set, a Bloom Filter stores only the items\\' hashed representations, thus sacrificing some precision. The trade-off is that Bloom Filters are very space-efficient and fast.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Bloom filter can guarantee the absence of an item from a set, but it can only give an estimation about its presence. So when it responds that an item is not present in a set (a negative answer), you can be sure that indeed is the case. But one out of every N positive answers will be wrong. Even though it looks unusual at first glance, this kind of uncertainty still has its place in computer science. There are many cases out there where a negative answer will prevent more costly operations, for example checking if a username has been taken, if a credit card has been reported as stolen, if a user has already seen an ad and much more.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.6566,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Reserving Bloom filters > Total size of a Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The actual memory used by a Bloom filter is a function of the chosen error rate:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe optimal number of hash functions is `ceil(-ln(error_rate) / ln(2))`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe required number of bits per item, given the desired `error_rate` and the optimal number of hash functions, is `-ln(error_rate) / ln(2)^2`.

Hashes offer a middle ground with indexing support but simpler structure.\n\n**Atomic Operations:** JSON allows atomic operations on nested elements without retrieving/reserializing the entire object, which is more efficient than serializing JSON as a string.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md > Choose a data type > Documents]\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/use_cases.md]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisjson/redisjson-2.0-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/document-database.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/use_cases.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/ram.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["hash", "field", "integer", "geo"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisjson/redisjson-2.0-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/document-database.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/use_cases.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/json/ram.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "877764ce-c5f8-4990-bd4e-8477ac453b03", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "d8778200-0d42-43f9-9d3d-cfdb9b6a55d2", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information comparing Redis Hashes and JSON data types.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_VGesoBFSQTi6Yhzv5t0wAg', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Hashes vs JSON comparison when to use', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_uXSphXt1Cxdog5IYKV0uV3', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'Hash.*JSON|JSON.*Hash'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_VGesoBFSQTi6Yhzv5t0wAg', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.7747,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Compare data types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Choose a data type > Documents\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"You would normally store document data using the string, hash, or JSON\\\\\\\\ntypes.

Instead of storing actual elements (which would require memory proportional to the number of items), it maintains a compact state that allows it to estimate unique counts.\n\n**Key characteristics**:\n- Uses up to 12 KB of memory maximum (or much less for smaller sets)\n- Provides a standard error rate of 0.81% (less than 1%)\n- Can estimate cardinality of sets with up to 2^64 members\n- Constant time and space for writes and reads\n\n## Basic operations\n\n```redis\n> PFADD bikes Hyperion Deimos Phobes Quaoar\n(integer) 1\n> PFCOUNT bikes\n(integer) 4\n> PFADD commuter_bikes Salacia Mimas Quaoar\n(integer) 1\n> PFMERGE all_bikes bikes commuter_bikes\nOK\n> PFCOUNT all_bikes\n(integer) 6\n```\n\n**Commands**:\n- `PFADD` - adds an item to the HyperLogLog (constant time)\n- `PFCOUNT` - returns estimated count of unique items (constant time)\n- `PFMERGE` - combines multiple HyperLogLogs into one (O(n) where n is number of sketches)\n\n## Use cases\n\n**Anonymous unique visitor tracking**: Count unique page views, video plays, or song listens without storing personal identifiers (IP addresses), which is important for privacy compliance.\n\n**Comparison with Sets**: Conceptually similar to using `SADD` and `SCARD` on Redis Sets, but HyperLogLog uses constant memory regardless of cardinality, while Sets require memory proportional to the number of elements.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md > Use cases]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/gears-v1/python/quickstart.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisce-7.4-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["error rate", "hyperloglog", "cardinality", "PFADD", "list", "integer", "TS.", "probabilistic"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/gears-v1/python/quickstart.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisce-7.4-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "ecdad171-e636-4edb-8dc1-8a4fc43de874", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "a9e84718-8af9-4ac0-a757-f437089f8866", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about HyperLogLog in Redis using multiple approaches.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_UoRww5vxO6dgd44idX7RPj', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'HyperLogLog'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_DKYWO5Zha3I3ZTLtAeGrnl', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'HyperLogLog count unique elements Redis', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_UoRww5vxO6dgd44idX7RPj', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_DKYWO5Zha3I3ZTLtAeGrnl', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 6.0663,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Use cases\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the cardinality of a set, trading perfect accuracy for efficient space utilization. The Redis implementation uses up to 12 KB of memory and provides a standard error rate of 0.81%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCounting unique items usually requires an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items you want to count, because you need\\\\\\\\nto remember the elements you have already seen in the past in order to avoid\\\\\\\\ncounting them multiple times. However, a set of algorithms exist that trade \\\\\\\\nmemory for precision: they return an estimated measure with a standard error, \\\\\\\\nwhich, in the case of the Redis implementation for HyperLogLog, is less than 1%.\\\\\\\\nThe magic of this algorithm is that you no longer need to use an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items counted, and instead can use a\\\\\\\\nconstant amount of memory; 12k bytes in the worst case, or a lot less if your\\\\\\\\nHyperLogLog (We\\'ll just call them HLL from now) has seen very few elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHLLs in Redis, while technically a different data structure, are encoded\\\\\\\\nas a Redis string, so you can call [`GET`]() to serialize a HLL, and [`SET`]()\\\\\\\\nto deserialize it back to the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConceptually the HLL API is like using Sets to do the same task.

From the `redis-cli`, run the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> RG.PYEXECUTE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GearsBuilder().run()\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis command doesn\\'t do much; it simply iterates over the keyspace. Let\\'s add a key and run it again:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> SET message \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello world\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> RG.PYEXECUTE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GearsBuilder().run()\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'event\\': None, \\'key\\': \\'message\\', \\'type\\': \\'string\\', \\'value\\': \\'hello world\\'}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ve added a single string, and you can see that this gears function processes it, even though it does nothing with the data. Let\\'s actually do something with the data. So first, we\\'ll add a few more strings:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud::6379> SET message:2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello galaxy\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\nredis.cloud:6379> SET message:3 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello universe\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe now have three strings in our database. Suppose we want to perform a unique word count on these strings. We can write a RedisGears function to do this just that. So open a file called `wordcount.py`, and add the following code:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```py\\\\\\\\ngb = GearsBuilder()\\\\\\\\ngb.map(lambda x: x[\\'value\\'])     # map each key object to its string value\\\\\\\\ngb.flatmap(lambda x: x.split())  # split each string into a list of words\\\\\\\\ngb.countby()                     # run a count-unique on these words\\\\\\\\ngb.run()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to load files into RedisGears. For production deployments, we recommend using the special [`gears-cli`](https://github.com/gears-project/gears-cli). However, for the purpose of this demonstration, the easiest way is to pass the filename through the `redis-cli` command, like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli rg.pyexecute \\\\\\\\\\\\\"`cat wordcount.py`\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'world\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'galaxy\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'hello\\', \\'value\\': 3}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n   4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\'key\\': \\'universe\\', \\'value\\': 1}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe results here show the number of occurrences of each word in all of our strings. So, we\\'ve effectively processed the data in our Redis database all at once, in a batch.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='HyperLogLog in Redis is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the cardinality (count of unique elements) of a set with remarkable space efficiency.\\n\\n## How it works\\n\\n**Core principle**: HyperLogLog trades perfect accuracy for efficient space utilization.

Lists）实现，元素按插入顺序排列\n- **Streams**: 使用固定大小的内存块（chunks）+ Radix Tree 索引，专为流式数据设计\n\n### 2. **消息队列能力**\n**Lists 的局限**：\n- 适合简单的栈和队列场景\n- 使用 `LPUSH`/`RPUSH` 添加，`LPOP`/`RPOP` 消费\n- 缺乏消费者组（Consumer Group）机制\n- 无法追踪消息处理状态\n\n**Streams 的优势**：\n- 提供完整的消息队列功能\n- 支持消费者组（Consumer Groups）\n- 可追踪消息处理状态（pending/acknowledged）\n- 支持消息去重（Idempotency）\n- 实时流式处理（real streaming API）\n\n### 3. **数据保留策略**\n- **Lists**: 按消息数量限制（capped stream）\n- **Streams**: 按时间窗口保留（retention policy in milliseconds），更适合时序数据\n\n### 4. **性能特点**\n- **Lists**: 头尾操作 O(1)，但按索引访问较慢\n- **Streams**: 使用 Radix Tree 索引，支持高效的范围查询和消费者组管理\n\n### 5. **使用场景**\n- **Lists**: 简单的后台任务队列、栈/队列操作\n- **Streams**: 复杂的消息队列、事件溯源、实时数据处理、需要消费者组协作的场景\n\n## 总结\n如果只需要简单的 FIFO 队列，Lists 足够；但如果需要消费者组、消息确认、去重、时间窗口保留等企业级消息队列特性，应该使用 Streams。\n\n---\n\n**来源**:\n- [redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md > Basic commands]\n-

Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2> {\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1657030402506\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"record\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo1\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]]}\\\\\\\\n2630021:M

`data` argument which pass to the stream consumer callback are in the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"<ms>\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<seq>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<stream name>\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream_name_raw\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<stream name as ArrayBuffer>\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"record\\\\\\\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\\n

],\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why the record is a list of touples and not an object is because the Redis Stream specifications allows duplicate keys.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotice that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS` `ArrayBuffer`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can observe the streams which are tracked by our registered consumer using `TFUNCTION LIST` command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFUNCTION LIST

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To communicate with the Redis server, Redis clients use a protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.5467,\\\\n

This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='根据检索结果，我来回答 Redis Lists 和 Streams 作为消息队列的区别：\\n\\n## 核心区别\\n\\n### 1. **数据结构实现**\\n- **Lists**: 基于链表（Linked Lists）实现，元素按插入顺序排列\\n- **Streams**: 使用固定大小的内存块（chunks）+ Radix Tree 索引，专为流式数据设计\\n\\n### 2. **消息队列能力**\\n**Lists 的局限**：\\n- 适合简单的栈和队列场景\\n- 使用 `LPUSH`/`RPUSH` 添加，`LPOP`/`RPOP` 消费\\n- 缺乏消费者组（Consumer Group）机制\\n- 无法追踪消息处理状态\\n\\n**Streams 的优势**：\\n- 提供完整的消息队列功能\\n- 支持消费者组（Consumer Groups）\\n- 可追踪消息处理状态（pending/acknowledged）\\n- 支持消息去重（Idempotency）\\n- 实时流式处理（real streaming API）\\n\\n### 3. **数据保留策略**\\n- **Lists**: 按消息数量限制（capped stream）\\n- **Streams**: 按时间窗口保留（retention policy in milliseconds），更适合时序数据\\n\\n### 4. **性能特点**\\n- **Lists**: 头尾操作 O(1)，但按索引访问较慢\\n- **Streams**: 使用 Radix Tree 索引，支持高效的范围查询和消费者组管理\\n\\n### 5. **使用场景**\\n- **Lists**: 简单的后台任务队列、栈/队列操作\\n- **Streams**: 复杂的消息队列、事件溯源、实时数据处理、需要消费者组协作的场景\\n\\n## 总结\\n如果只需要简单的 FIFO 队列，Lists 足够；但如果需要消费者组、消息确认、去重、时间窗口保留等企业级消息队列特性，应该使用 Streams。\\n\\n---\\n\\n**来源**:\\n- [redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md > Basic commands]\\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md > v1.0.0 Features]\\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/triggers/Stream_Triggers.md]')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "根据检索结果，我来回答 Redis Lists 和 Streams 作为消息队列的区别：\n\n## 核心区别\n\n### 1. **数据结构实现**\n- **Lists**: 基于链表（Linked Lists）实现，元素按插入顺序排列\n- **Streams**: 使用固定大小的内存块（chunks）+ Radix Tree 索引，专为流式数据设计\n\n### 2. **消息队列能力**\n**Lists 的局限**：\n- 适合简单的栈和队列场景\n- 使用 `LPUSH`/`RPUSH` 添加，`LPOP`/`RPOP` 消费\n- 缺乏消费者组（Consumer Group）机制\n- 无法追踪消息处理状态\n\n**Streams 的优势**：\n- 提供完整的消息队列功能\n- 支持消费者组（Consumer Groups）\n- 可追踪消息处理状态（pending/acknowledged）\n- 支持消息去重（Idempotency）\n- 实时流式处理（real streaming API）\n\n### 3. **数据保留策略**\n- **Lists**: 按消息数量限制（capped stream）\n- **Streams**: 按时间窗口保留（retention policy in milliseconds），更适合时序数据\n\n### 4. **性能特点**\n- **Lists**: 头尾操作 O(1)，但按索引访问较慢\n- **Streams**: 使用 Radix Tree 索引，支持高效的范围查询和消费者组管理\n\n### 5. **使用场景**\n- **Lists**: 简单的后台任务队列、栈/队列操作\n- **Streams**: 复杂的消息队列、事件溯源、实时数据处理、需要消费者组协作的场景\n\n## 总结\n如果只需要简单的 FIFO 队列，Lists 足够；但如果需要消费者组、消息确认、去重、时间窗口保留等企业级消息队列特性，应该使用 Streams。\n\n---\n\n**来源**:\n- [redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md > Basic commands]\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md > v1.0.0 Features]\n- [redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/triggers/Stream_Triggers.md]", "session_id": "2b91ecc2-9f9c-4b9b-a910-e7ec2972b019", "num_turns": 2, "duration_ms": 144562, "total_cost_usd": 0.05991025, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1413, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2827, "cache_read_input_tokens": 35353, "output_tokens": 700, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

You can work with anything from unsigned 1-bit integers to signed 63-bit integers.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Atomic operations**: Bitfields support atomic read, write, and increment operations\n- **Flexible integer sizes**: Handle any integer width from 1 to 63 bits\n- **Multiple operations**: Can perform multiple operations in a single command\n- **Efficient storage**: Values are stored as binary-encoded strings\n\n### When to Use Bitfields\n\nBitfields are ideal for:\n\n1. **Managing counters and numerical values** - The atomic operations make them perfect for tracking metrics\n2. **Space-efficient storage** - When you need to pack multiple integer values into a single key\n3. **Scenarios requiring multiple related counters** - You can store and update multiple values atomically\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nHere's a practical example tracking bicycle statistics (price and number of owners):\n\n```redis\n# Set initial price to 1000\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats SET u32 #0 1000\n1) (integer) 0\n\n# Decrease price by 50, increment owner count\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 -50 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 950\n2) (integer) 1\n\n# Increase price by 500, increment owner count again\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 500 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n\n# Read both values\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats GET u32 #0 GET u32 #1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n```\n\n### Available Commands\n\n- `BITFIELD` - Atomically sets, increments, and reads one or more values\n- `BITFIELD_RO` - Read-only variant of BITFIELD\n\n### Performance\n\n`BITFIELD` has O(n) complexity, where n is the number of counters accessed.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitfields.md > Performance]",

However, if your use case allows you to have less fine-grained data further back in time, downsampling can be applied. This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function. RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using Redis’ core data structures, you can only retrieve a time series by knowing the exact key holding the time series. Unfortunately, for many time series use cases (such as root cause analysis or monitoring), your application won’t know the exact key it’s looking for. These use cases typically want to query a set of time series that relate to each other in a couple of dimensions to extract the insight you need. You could create your own secondary index with core Redis data structures to help with this, but it would come with a high development cost and require you to manage edge cases to make sure the index is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries does this indexing for you based on `field value` pairs (a.k.a labels) you can add to each time series, and use to filter at query time (a full list of these filters is available in our documentation). Here’s an example of creating a time series with two labels (sensor_id and area_id are the fields with values 2 and 32 respectively) and a retention window of 60,000 milliseconds:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to query a time series, it’s cumbersome to stream all raw data points if you’re only interested in, say, an average over a given time interval. RedisTimeSeries follows the Redis philosophy to only transfer the minimum required data to ensure lowest latency. Below is an example of aggregation query over time buckets of 5,000 milliseconds with an aggregation function:  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.RANGE temperature:3:32 1548149180000 1548149210000 AGGREGATION avg 5000\\\\\\\\n1) 1) (integer) 1548149180000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"26.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) 1) (integer) 1548149185000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"27.399999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) 1) (integer) 1548149190000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"24.800000000000001\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) 1) (integer) 1548149195000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"23.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) 1) (integer) 1548149200000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"25.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) 1) (integer) 1548149205000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"28\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n7) 1) (integer) 1548149210000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"20\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries comes with several integrations into existing time series tools. One such integration is our [RedisTimeSeries adapter for Prometheus](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-redistimeseries-adapter), which keeps all your monitoring metrics inside RedisTimeSeries while leveraging the entire Prometheus ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, we also created direct integration for [Grafana](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/grafana-redistimeseries).

Use the `GEOADD` command to add locations:\n\n```redis\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.27652 37.805186 station:1\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2674626 37.8062344 station:2\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2469854 37.8104049 station:3\n```\n\n**Important**: Longitude comes **before** latitude with this command.\n\n## Querying Geospatial Data\n\n### 1. Radius Search\nFind all locations within a given radius and return distances:\n\n```redis\nGEOSEARCH bikes:rentable FROMLONLAT -122.2612767 37.7936847 BYRADIUS 5 km WITHDIST\n```\n\nReturns:\n```\n1) 1) \"station:1\"\n   2) \"1.8523\"\n2) 1) \"station:2\"\n   2) \"1.4979\"\n3) 1) \"station:3\"\n   2) \"2.2441\"\n```\n\n### 2. Bounding Box Search\nYou can also query using a bounding box with `GEOSEARCH`.\n\n## Advanced: Geospatial Polygons (Redis Stack 7.2+)\n\nFor more complex shapes, Redis Stack 7.2+ introduces **polygon queries**:\n\n- Use the `GEOSHAPE` field type with `FT.CREATE` to index polygon shapes\n- Supports WKT notation: `POLYGON((x1 y1, x2 y2, ...))`\n- Query with operators like `WITHIN` and `CONTAINS`\n- Supports both cartesian (X,Y) and geographic (lon, lat) coordinate systems\n\n## Use Cases\n\nPerfect for finding nearby points like:\n- Bike rental stations\n- Store locations\n- Delivery zones\n- Park attractions\n\n[Source: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/geospatial.md]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths":

performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process.

Adding the `GEOSHAPE` field type that supports polygon shapes using [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). Besides the current `GEO` (alias for `GEOPOINT`) used already geo range queries, we add the support for `POLYGON` as new shapes.

Detailed documentation and examples can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears#redisgears-20). The Triggers and Functions commands are aligned with the Redis Functions command.

It\\'s also possible\\\\\\\\nto do a number of other operations against sets like testing if a given element\\\\\\\\nalready exists, performing the intersection, union or difference between\\\\\\\\nmultiple sets, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> SMEMBERS bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) bike:3\\\\\\\\n2) bike:1\\\\\\\\n3) bike:2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere I\\'ve added three elements to my set and told Redis to return all the\\\\\\\\nelements. There is no order guarantee with a set. Redis is free to return the\\\\\\\\nelements in any order at every call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has commands to test for set membership. These commands can be used on single as well as multiple items:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> SISMEMBER bikes:racing:france bike:1\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SMISMEMBER bikes:racing:france bike:2 bike:3 bike:4\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can also find the difference between two sets. For instance, we may want\\\\\\\\nto know which bikes are racing in France but not in the USA:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:usa bike:1 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are other non trivial operations that are still easy to implement\\\\\\\\nusing the right Redis commands. For instance we may want a list of all the\\\\\\\\nbikes racing in France, the USA, and some other races. We can do this using\\\\\\\\nthe [`SINTER`]() command, which performs the intersection between different\\\\\\\\nsets. In addition to intersection you can also perform\\\\\\\\nunions, difference, and more. For example \\\\\\\\nif we add a third race we can see some of these commands in action:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:usa bike:1 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:italy bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> SINTER bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SUNION bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(empty array)\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll note that the [`SDIFF`]() command returns an empty array when the\\\\\\\\ndifference between all sets is empty. You\\'ll also note that the order of sets\\\\\\\\npassed to [`SDIFF`]() matters, since the difference is not commutative.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you want to remove items from a set, you can use the [`SREM`]() command to\\\\\\\\nremove one or more items from a set, or you can use the [`SPOP`]() command to\\\\\\\\nremove a random item from a set. You can also _return_ a random item from a\\\\\\\\nset without removing it using the [`SRANDMEMBER`]() command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> SREM bikes:racing:france bike:1\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SPOP bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SMEMBERS bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SRANDMEMBER bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe max size of a Redis set is 2^32 - 1 (4,294,967,295) members.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.0195,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a0527f7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a0527f7-043\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisstack 7.2 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Stack 7.2.0-rc1 (June 2023) > Details:\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Features**\\\\\\\\n* **Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#3553](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3553) Introduce support for Geo-polygon shapes and queries\\\\\\\\n    * [#3476](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3476) Adding `GEOMETRY` [field type](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) to map polygons in the `SCHEMA` on `FT.CREATE`\\\\\\\\n    * Adding polygons using [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry), for example `POLYGON((x1 y1, x2 y2, ...))`\\\\\\\\n    * [#3556](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3556) Adjust the [query syntax](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) on `FT.SEARCH` for Polygons using the predicate `@geom:[OPERATOR $poly]` and defining polygon in WKT format as `PARAMS 2 poly \\\\\\\\\\\\\"POLYGON((10 20, ...))\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` using `DIALECT 3`\\\\\\\\n    * Initially `WITHIN` and `CONTAINS` operators with Geometries only\\\\\\\\n  * [#3046](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3046) Introduce the `OPTIMIZE` keyword to `SORTBY` queries using `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` that improve performance in 4 different scenarios:\\\\\\\\n    * **Skip Sorter** - applied when there is no sort of any kind. The query can return once it reaches the `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * **Partial Range** - applied when there is a `SORTBY` numeric field, with no filter or filter by the same numeric field, the query iterate on a range large enough to satisfy the `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * **Hybrid** - applied when there is a `SORTBY` numeric field in addition to another non-numeric filter.

Geographic coordinate system using spherical indexing as default (`SPHERICAL`).\\\\\\\\n  * [#3046](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3046) Introduce performance optimization for sorting operations on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` as default on `DIALECT 4`. It will improve performance in 4 different scenarios, listed below:\\\\\\\\n    * Skip Sorter - applied when there is no sort of any kind. The query can return once it reaches the `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * Partial Range - applied when there is a `SORTBY` a numeric field, with no filter or filter by the same numeric field, the query iterate on a range large enough to satisfy the `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * Hybrid - applied when there is a `SORTBY` a numeric field in addition to another non-numeric filter.

Registrations of functions and triggers is done with mandatory arguments and a single optional object.\\\\\\\\n  * [#935](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/935) Ability to load an RDB from a Redis Server with the RedisGears module loaded but NOT used into a Redis Server without the RedisGears module.\\\\\\\\n  * Updated commands:\\\\\\\\n    * [#910](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/910) `TFUNCTION` and `TFCALL` is used instead of `RG.FUNCTION` and `RG.FCALL`.\\\\\\\\n    * [#939](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/939) The commands are updated to match the Redis Functions commands. `TFCALL` combines the library and function in a single argument with \\'.\\' separated. Example: `TFCALL <library_name>.<function_name>`.\\\\\\\\n    * [#900](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/900) rated the ability to run functions as a coroutine in `TFCALLASYNC`.

服务间网络延迟追踪\n- 存储系统 IO 带宽分析\n- 应用响应时间（如 99th percentile）监控\n\n### 2. 环境数据分析\n- **气象数据**：日照时长、降雨量、温度等多年数据追踪\n- **大气监测**：CO2 浓度的季节性和年度趋势分析\n\n### 3. 物联网与传感器数据\n- **飞行数据记录**：高度、航线、引擎温度、振动、压力等黑匣子数据\n- **船舶日志**：风速、海况、航速、位置等航行数据\n- **车联网**：加速度、位置、油耗、轮胎压力、保养里程等\n- **智能电表**：能源消耗/生产数据的实时采集与计费\n\n### 4. 电信服务质量\n- 基站流量监控\n- 峰值流量与事件关联分析\n- 负载均衡与基础设施预测性规划\n\n### 5. 金融交易\n- 股票价格波动（毫秒级响应）\n- 交易行为与社交网络事件关联\n- 异常检测（如内幕交易识别）\n\n---\n\n## Retention（数据保留）配置\n\n### 配置优先级\n1. **Key 级别**：通过 `TS.CREATE` 或 `TS.ALTER` 的 `RETENTION` 参数设置\n2. **全局默认**：通过 `ts-retention-policy` 配置参数\n3. **无保留策略**：数据永久保留\n\n### 配置方法\n\n#### 创建时间序列时指定 retention（单位：毫秒）\n```sh\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\n```\n上例设置 60 秒（60,000 毫秒）的保留窗口。\n\n#### 设置全局默认 retention\n\n**Redis < 8.0**（启动时加载）：\n```sh\nredis-server --loadmodule ./redistimeseries.so RETENTION_POLICY 25920000000\n```\n\n**Redis >= 8.0**（运行时配置）：\n```sh\nCONFIG SET ts-retention-policy 25920000000\n```\n上例设置默认保留 300 天（25,920,000,000 毫秒）。\n\n### 关键特性\n- Retention 以**毫秒为单位**，更适合时间序列场景（相比 Redis Streams 的按消息数量限制）\n- 超过保留期的数据会自动删除\n- 可结合 **downsampling**（降采样）实现分层存储：原始数据短期保留，聚合数据长期保留\n\n---\n\n**来源**：\n- [use_cases.md

center)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern data centers have a lot of moving pieces, such as infrastructure (servers and networks) and software systems (applications and services) that need to be monitored around the clock.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Time Series allows you to plan for new resources upfront, optimize the utilization of existing resources, reconstruct the circumstances that led to outages, and identify application performance issues by analyzing and reporting on the following metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Maximum CPU utilization per server\\\\\\\\n- Maximum network latency between two services\\\\\\\\n- Average IO bandwidth utilization of a storage system\\\\\\\\n- 99th percentile of the response time of a specific application outages\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Weather analysis (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Time Series can be used to track environmental measurements such as the number of daily sunshine hours and hourly rainfall depth, over a period of many years. Seasonally, you can measure average rainfall depth, average daily temperature, and the maximum number of sunny hours per day, for example. Watch the increase of the maximum daily temperature over the years. Predict the expected temperature and rainfall depth in a specific location for a particular week of the year.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultiple time series can be collected, each for a different location. By utilizing secondary indexes, measurements can be aggregated over given geographical regions (e.g., minimal and maximal daily temperature in Europe) or over locations with specific attributes (e.g., average rainfall depth in mountainous regions).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample metrics include: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Rain (cm)\\\\\\\\n- Temperature (C)\\\\\\\\n- Sunny periods (h)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Analysis of the atmosphere (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe atmospheric concentration of CO2 is more important than ever before. Use TimeSeries to track average, maximum and minimum CO2 level per season and average yearly CO2 over the last decades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Concentration of CO2 (ppm)\\\\\\\\n- Location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Flight data recording (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlanes have a multitude of sensors. This sensor data is stored in a black box and also shared with external systems. TimeSeries can help you reconstruct the sequence of events over time, optimize operations and maintenance intervals, improve safety, and provide feedback to the equipment manufacturers about the part quality. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Altitude\\\\\\\\n- Flight path\\\\\\\\n- Engine temperature\\\\\\\\n- Level of vibrations\\\\\\\\n- Pressure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ship logbooks (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s very common to keep track of ship voyages via (digital) logbooks. Use TimeSeries to calculate optimal routes using these metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Wind (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Ocean conditions (classes)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (knots)\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Connected car (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern cars are exposing several metrics via a standard interface. Use TimeSeries to correlate average fuel consumption with the tire pressure, figure out how long to keep a car in the fleet, determine optimal maintenance intervals, and calculate tax savings by type of the road (taxable vs. nontaxable roads). Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Acceleration\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n- Fuel level (liter)\\\\\\\\n- Distances (km)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Tire pressure\\\\\\\\n- Distance until next maintenance check\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Smart metering (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern houses and facilities gather details about energy consumption/production. Use Redis Time Series to aggregate billing based on monthly consumption. Optimize the network by redirecting the energy delivery relative to the fluctuations in need. Provide recommendations on how to improve the energy consumption behavior. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Consumption per location\\\\\\\\n- Produced amount of electrical energy per location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Quality of service (telecom)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMobile phone usage is increasing, producing a natural growth that just correlates to the increasing number of cellphones. However, there might also be spikes that correlate with specific events (for example, more messages around world championships). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTelecom providers need to ensure that they are providing the necessary infrastructure to deliver the right quality of service. This includes using mini towers for short-term peaks. Use TimeSeries to correlate traffic peaks to specific events, load balance traffic over several towers or mini towers, and predictively plan the infrastructure. Metrics include the amount of traffic per tower.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Stock trading (finance)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStock trading is highly automated today. Algorithms, and not just human beings, are trading, from the amount of bids and asks for the trading of a stock to the extreme volumes of trades per second (millions of ops per second). Computer-driven trading requires millisecond response times. It\\'s necessary to keep a lot of data points within a very short period of time (for example, price fluctuations per second within a minute). In addition, the long-term history needs to be kept to make statements about trends or for regulatory purposes.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse Redis Time Series to identify correlations between the trading behavior and other events (for example, social network posts). Discover a developing market. Detect anomalies to discover insider trades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Exact time and order of a trade by itself\\\\\\\\n- Type of the event (trade/bid)\\\\\\\\n- The stock price\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7569,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redistimeseries 1.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.0.0 (June 2019) > Features > Integrations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If you want to keep all of your raw data points indefinitely, your data set will grow linearly over time. However, if your use case allows you to have less fine-grained data further back in time, downsampling can be applied. This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function. RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using Redis’ core data structures, you can only retrieve a time series by knowing the exact key holding the time series. Unfortunately, for many time series use cases (such as root cause analysis or monitoring), your application won’t know the exact key it’s looking for. These use cases typically want to query a set of time series that relate to each other in a couple of dimensions to extract the insight you need. You could create your own secondary index with core Redis data structures to help with this, but it would come with a high development cost and require you to manage edge cases to make sure the index is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries does this indexing for you based on `field value` pairs (a.k.a labels) you can add to each time series, and use to filter at query time (a full list of these filters is available in our documentation). Here’s an example of creating a time series with two labels (sensor_id and area_id are the fields with values 2 and 32 respectively) and a retention window of 60,000 milliseconds:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to query a time series, it’s cumbersome to stream all raw data points if you’re only interested in, say, an average over a given time interval. RedisTimeSeries follows the Redis philosophy to only transfer the minimum required data to ensure lowest latency. Below is an example of aggregation query over time buckets of 5,000 milliseconds with an aggregation function:  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.RANGE temperature:3:32 1548149180000 1548149210000 AGGREGATION avg 5000\\\\\\\\n1) 1) (integer) 1548149180000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"26.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) 1) (integer) 1548149185000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"27.399999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) 1) (integer) 1548149190000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"24.800000000000001\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) 1) (integer) 1548149195000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"23.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) 1) (integer) 1548149200000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"25.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) 1) (integer) 1548149205000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"28\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n7) 1) (integer) 1548149210000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"20\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries comes with several integrations into existing time series tools. One such integration is our [RedisTimeSeries adapter for Prometheus](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-redistimeseries-adapter), which keeps all your monitoring metrics inside RedisTimeSeries while leveraging the entire Prometheus ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, we also created direct integration for [Grafana](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/grafana-redistimeseries). [This repository](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-demos) contains a docker-compose setup of RedisTimeSeries, its remote write adaptor, Prometheus and Grafana.

Redis has special list commands to make this use case both more reliable and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example both the popular Ruby libraries [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) and\\\\\\\\n[sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) use Redis lists under the hood in order to\\\\\\\\nimplement background jobs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe popular Twitter social network [takes the latest tweets](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Real-Time-Delivery-Twitter)\\\\\\\\nposted by users into Redis lists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo describe a common use case step by step, imagine your home page shows the latest\\\\\\\\nphotos published in a photo sharing social network and you want to speedup access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time a user posts a new photo, we add its ID into a list with [`LPUSH`]().\\\\\\\\n* When users visit the home page, we use `LRANGE 0 9` in order to get the latest 10 posted items.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn many use cases we just want to use lists to store the *latest items*,\\\\\\\\nwhatever they are: social network updates, logs, or anything else.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis allows us to use lists as a capped collection, only remembering the latest\\\\\\\\nN items and discarding all the oldest items using the [`LTRIM`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`LTRIM`]() command is similar to [`LRANGE`](), but **instead of displaying the\\\\\\\\nspecified range of elements** it sets this range as the new list value. All\\\\\\\\nthe elements outside the given range are removed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you\\'re adding bikes on the end of a list of repairs, but only\\\\\\\\nwant to worry about the 3 that have been on the list the longest:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs 0 2\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above [`LTRIM`]() command tells Redis to keep just list elements from index\\\\\\\\n0 to 2, everything else will be discarded. This allows for a very simple but\\\\\\\\nuseful pattern: doing a List push operation + a List trim operation together \\\\\\\\nto add a new element and discard elements exceeding a limit. Using \\\\\\\\n[`LTRIM`]() with negative indexes can then be used to keep only the 3 most recently added:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs -3 -1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above combination adds new elements and keeps only the 3\\\\\\\\nnewest elements into the list. With [`LRANGE`]() you can access the top items\\\\\\\\nwithout any need to remember very old data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: while [`LRANGE`]() is technically an O(N) command, accessing small ranges\\\\\\\\ntowards the head or the tail of the list is a constant time operation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.8369,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Client and Server roles in the Redis cluster protocol > Write safety\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster uses asynchronous replication between nodes, and **last failover wins** implicit merge function. This means that the last elected master dataset eventually replaces all the other replicas. There is always a window of time when it is possible to lose writes during partitions. However these windows are very different in the case of a client that is connected to the majority of masters, and a client that is connected to the minority of masters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster tries harder to retain writes that are performed by clients connected to the majority of masters, compared to writes performed in the minority side.\\\\\\\\nThe following are examples of scenarios that lead to loss of acknowledged\\\\\\\\nwrites received in the majority partitions during failures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A write may reach a master, but while the master may be able to reply to the client, the write may not be propagated to replicas via the asynchronous replication used between master and replica nodes. If the master dies without the write reaching the replicas, the write is lost forever if the master is unreachable for a long enough period that one of its replicas is promoted. This is usually hard to observe in the case of a total, sudden failure of a master node since masters try to reply to clients (with the acknowledge of the write) and replicas (propagating the write) at about the same time. However it is a real world failure mode.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Another theoretically possible failure mode where writes are lost is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A master is unreachable because of a partition.\\\\\\\\n* It gets failed over by one of its replicas.\\\\\\\\n* After some time it may be reachable again.\\\\\\\\n* A client with an out-of-date routing table may write to the old master before it is converted into a replica (of the new master) by the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second failure mode is unlikely to happen because master nodes unable to communicate with the majority of the other masters for enough time to be failed over will no longer accept writes, and when the partition is fixed writes are still refused for a small amount of time to allow other nodes to inform about configuration changes. This failure mode also requires that the client\\'s routing table has not yet been updated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWrites targeting the minority side of a partition have a larger window in which to get lost. For example, Redis Cluster loses a non-trivial number of writes on partitions where there is a minority of masters and at least one or more clients, since all the writes sent to the masters may potentially get lost if the masters are failed over in the majority side.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, for a master to be failed over it must be unreachable by the majority of masters for at least `NODE_TIMEOUT`, so if the partition is fixed before that time, no writes are lost. When the partition lasts for more than `NODE_TIMEOUT`, all the writes performed in the minority side up to that point may be lost. However the minority side of a Redis Cluster will start refusing writes as soon as `NODE_TIMEOUT` time has elapsed without contact with the majority, so there is a maximum window after which the minority becomes no longer available. Hence, no writes are accepted or lost after that time.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_QIQ37y7JUh7ap2zolYt4AB', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7623,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"608370db\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"608370db-009\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/timeseries/configuration.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration Parameters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Time series configuration parameters > RETENTION_POLICY / ts-retention-policy > Example\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Because the retention can be provided at different levels, the actual precedence of the retention is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Below is an example of aggregation query over time buckets of 5,000 milliseconds with an aggregation function:  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TS.RANGE temperature:3:32 1548149180000 1548149210000 AGGREGATION avg 5000\\\\\\\\n1) 1) (integer) 1548149180000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"26.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) 1) (integer) 1548149185000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"27.399999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) 1) (integer) 1548149190000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"24.800000000000001\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) 1) (integer) 1548149195000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"23.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) 1) (integer) 1548149200000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"25.199999999999999\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) 1) (integer) 1548149205000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"28\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n7) 1) (integer) 1548149210000\\\\\\\\n   2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"20\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries comes with several integrations into existing time series tools. One such integration is our [RedisTimeSeries adapter for Prometheus](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-redistimeseries-adapter), which keeps all your monitoring metrics inside RedisTimeSeries while leveraging the entire Prometheus ecosystem.\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, we also created direct integration for [Grafana](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/grafana-redistimeseries). [This repository](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/prometheus-demos) contains a docker-compose setup of RedisTimeSeries, its remote write adaptor, Prometheus and Grafana.

"passed", "elapsed_seconds": 174.82125234603882, "cost_usd": 0.06905275, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 3841, "answer": "Based on the search results from the Redis knowledge base, here's a comparison of Count-Min Sketch and Top-K probabilistic data structures:\n\n## Overview\n\nBoth are probabilistic data structures in Redis for analyzing data streams, but they serve different purposes:\n\n- **Count-Min Sketch (CMS)**: Estimates the frequency/count of elements in a stream\n- **Top-K**: Identifies the K highest-frequency elements in a stream\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### Purpose & Use Cases\n\n**Count-Min Sketch:**\n- Answers: \"How many times has element X appeared?\"\n- Best for: Tracking sales volume, event frequencies, product popularity\n- Works well when you need counts for **specific known elements**\n- Only useful for higher counts; low counts should be ignored as noise\n\n**Top-K:**\n- Answers: \"What are the K most frequent elements?\"\n- Best for: Detecting network anomalies/DDoS attacks, trending hashtags, top news articles\n- Works well when you need to identify **unknown high-frequency elements**\n- Provides real-time notifications when elements enter/leave the top-K list\n\n### Algorithm & Implementation\n\n**Count-Min Sketch:**\n- Uses a 2D array (width × depth) with multiple hash functions\n- Each element hashed to multiple positions, increments counters\n- Query returns the minimum count across all hash positions\n- Over-counts due to collisions (conservative estimate)\n\n**Top-K:**\n- Based on the [HeavyKeepers algorithm](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong)\n- Uses two structures: hash table (like CMS) + min heap\n- Employs \"count-with-exponential-decay\" strategy\n- Biased against small flows, limited impact on large flows\n- Time complexity: O(K*log(k)) for listing top-K items\n\n### Accuracy & Thresholds\n\n**Count-Min Sketch:**\n- Has a threshold: `threshold = error_rate × total_count`\n- Results below threshold should be ignored/approximated to zero\n- Requires careful sizing based on expected distribution\n- Better for non-uniform distributions with clear heavy hitters\n\n**Top-K:**\n- Higher accuracy with shorter execution times than previous algorithms\n- Memory usage is a fraction of what a Sorted Set would require\n- More efficient for identifying top elements without tracking all counts\n\n### Operations\n\n**Count-Min Sketch:**\n- `CMS.INITBYPROB` - Initialize with error rate and probability\n- `CMS.INCRBY` - Increment element counts\n- `CMS.QUERY` - Get estimated count for specific elements\n- No deletion support\n\n**Top-K:**\n- `TOPK.RESERVE` - Initialize with K, width, depth, decay\n- `TOPK.ADD` / `TOPK.INCRBY` - Add/increment elements\n- `TOPK.LIST` - Get the top-K elements\n- `TOPK.QUERY` - Check if element is in top-K\n- Supports dynamic updates as elements enter/leave top-K\n\n## When to Use Which?\n\n**Use Count-Min Sketch when:**\n- You need to query counts for specific known elements\n- You have a non-uniform distribution with clear heavy hitters\n- You can tolerate over-counting and have a clear threshold\n- Example: \"How many units of product X sold today?\"\n\n**Use Top-K when:**\n- You need to discover which elements are most frequent\n- You want real-time updates on ranking changes\n- You need better performance for top-element queries\n- Example: \"What are the 10 most attacked IP addresses right now?\"\n\n## Overlap & Complementary Use\n\nAs noted in the documentation: \"There is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases.\"\n\nYou can use them together: Top-K to identify the most frequent elements, then Count-Min Sketch to track detailed counts for those specific elements over time.\n\n[来源:

score can be a count of how many times the element has appeared in the stream - thus making the data structure perfect for finding the elements with the highest frequency in a stream.\\\\\\\\nOne very common application is detecting network anomalies and DDoS attacks where Top K can answer the question: Is there a sudden increase in the flux of requests to the same address or from the same IP?\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Open Source implementation of Top-K is based on the [HeavyKeepers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong) algorithm presented by Junzhi Gong et al. It discards some older approaches like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"count-all\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"admit-all-count-some\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in favour of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**count-with-exponential-decay**\\\\\\\\\\\\\" strategy which is biased against mouse (small) flows and has a limited impact on elephant (large) flows. This implementation uses two data structures in tandem: a hash table that holds the probabilistic counts (much like the Count-Min Sketch), and a min heap that holds the `K` items with the highest counts. This ensures high accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms allowed, while keeping memory utilization to a fraction of what is typically required by a Sorted Set. It has the additional benefit of being able to get real time notifications when elements are added or removed from the Top K list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trending hashtags (social media platforms, news distribution networks)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What are the K hashtags people have mentioned the most in the last X hours? \\\\\\\\n- What are the K news with highest read/view count today? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData flow is the incoming social media posts from which you parse out the different hashtags. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`TOPK.LIST`]() command has a time complexity of `O(K*log(k))` so if `K` is small, there is no need to keep a separate set or sorted set of all the hashtags. You can query directly from the Top K itself.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.4181,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/count-min-sketch.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-min sketch\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-Min Sketch is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Open Source that can be used to estimate the frequency of events/elements in a stream of data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt uses a sub-linear space at the expense of over-counting some events due to collisions. It consumes a stream of events/elements and keeps estimated counters of their frequency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is very important to know that the results coming from a Count-Min sketch lower than a certain threshold (determined by the error_rate) should be ignored and often even approximated to zero. So Count-Min sketch is indeed a data-structure for counting frequencies of elements in a stream, but it\\'s only useful for higher counts. Very low counts should be ignored as noise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Products (retail, online shops)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers this question: What was the sales volume (on a certain day) for a product? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse one Count-Min sketch created per day (period). Every product sale goes into the CMS. The CMS give reasonably accurate results for the products that contribute the most toward the sales. Products with low percentage of the total sales are ignored.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAssume you select an error rate of 0.1% (0.001) with a certainty of 99.8% (0.998). This means you have an error probability of 0.02% (0.002). Your sketch strives to keep the error within 0.1% of the total count of all elements you\\'ve added. There\\'s a 0.02% chance the error might exceed this—like when an element below the threshold overlaps with one above it. When you add a few items to the CMS and evaluate their frequency, remember that in such a small sample, collisions are rare, as seen with other probabilistic data structures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INITBYPROB bikes:profit 0.001 0.002\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 100\\\\\\\\n(integer) 100\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 200 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 150\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n> CMS.QUERY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Terrible Bike Name\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 100\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INFO bikes:profit\\\\\\\\n1) width\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 2000\\\\\\\\n3) depth\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 9\\\\\\\\n5) count\\\\\\\\n6) (integer) 450\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.9105,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ede072de\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ede072de-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisbloom/redisbloom-2.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisbloom 2.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v2.0.0 (June 2019)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"RedisBloom v2.0.3 requires:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Minimum Redis compatibility version (database): 4.0.0\\\\\\\\n- Minimum Redis Enterprise Software version (cluster): 5.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Performance improvements:\\\\\\\\n    - #[95](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/95) Top-K - Reduce checks on heap, now only checks if item count is larger than minimum in heap.\\\\\\\\n    - #[95](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/issues/95) Top-K - The power of decay was calculated every time.

It can be used to answer the following questions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What fraction of the values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- How many values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- Which value is smaller than _p_ percent of the values in the data stream? (what is the _p_-percentile value)?\\\\\\\\n- What is the mean value between the _p1_-percentile value and the _p2_-percentile value?\\\\\\\\n- What is the value of the _n_-th smallest / largest value in the data stream? (what is the value with [reverse] rank _n_)?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs for any other probabilistic data structures, t-digest requires sublinear space and has controllable space-accuracy tradeoffs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing t-digest is simple and straightforward:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Creating a sketch and adding observations**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.CREATE key [COMPRESSION compression]` initializes a new t-digest sketch (and errors if the key already exists). The `COMPRESSION` argument is used to specify the tradeoff between accuracy and memory consumption. The default is 100. Higher values mean more accuracy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.ADD key value...` adds new observations (floating-point values) to the sketch. You can repeat calling [TDIGEST.ADD]() whenever new observations are available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating fractions or ranks by values**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.CDF key value...` to retrieve, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **fraction** of (observations **smaller** than the given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.RANK key value...` is similar to [TDIGEST.CDF](), but used for estimating the number of observations instead of the fraction of observations. More accurately it returns, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **number** of (observations **smaller** than a given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  And lastly, `TDIGEST.REVRANK key value...` is similar to [TDIGEST.RANK](), but returns, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **number** of (observations **larger** than a given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating values by fractions or ranks**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.QUANTILE key fraction...` returns, for each input **fraction**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) that is **smaller** than the given fraction of observations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.BYRANK key rank...` returns, for each input **rank**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) with that rank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.BYREVRANK key rank...` returns, for each input **reverse rank**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) with that reverse rank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating trimmed mean**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.TRIMMED_MEAN key lowFraction highFraction` to retrieve an estimation of the mean value between the specified fractions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  This is especially useful for calculating the average value ignoring outliers. For example, calculating the average value between the 20th percentile and the 80th percentile.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Merging sketches**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Sometimes it is useful to merge sketches. For example, suppose we measure latencies for 3 servers, and we want to calculate the 90%, 95%, and 99% latencies for all the servers combined.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.MERGE destKey numKeys sourceKey... [COMPRESSION compression] [OVERRIDE]` merges multiple sketches into a single sketch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  If `destKey` does not exist, a new sketch is created.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  If `destKey` is an existing sketch, its values are merged with the values of the source keys. To override the destination key contents, use `OVERRIDE`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Retrieving sketch information**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.MIN` key and `TDIGEST.MAX key` to retrieve the minimal and maximal values in the sketch, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Both return NaN (Not a Number) when the sketch is empty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Both commands return accurate results and are equivalent to `TDIGEST.BYRANK key 0` and `TDIGEST.BYREVRANK key 0` respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.INFO key` to retrieve some additional information about the sketch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Resetting a sketch**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.RESET key` empties the sketch and reinitializes it.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6481,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Use cases\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog is a probabilistic data structure that estimates the cardinality of a set, trading perfect accuracy for efficient space utilization.

Here's how it works:\n\n## Failover Process Overview\n\nWhen a master fails, Sentinel performs automatic failover through these key steps:\n\n**1. Failure Detection**\n- Multiple Sentinel processes must agree that a master is down before triggering failover\n- A master is marked as **ODOWN** (Objectively Down) when the configured **quorum** of Sentinels detect it as unreachable\n- This consensus approach reduces false positives\n\n**2. Authorization**\n- After ODOWN is triggered, the Sentinel attempting failover must get authorization from a **majority** of Sentinels (not just the quorum)\n- Example: With 5 Sentinels and quorum=2, failover triggers when 2 Sentinels detect failure, but requires authorization from at least 3 Sentinels to proceed\n- This prevents failovers in network partitions where only a minority of Sentinels exist\n\n**3. Replica Selection**\nSentinel selects a new master by evaluating replicas based on:\n- **Disconnection time**: Replicas disconnected for more than `(down-after-milliseconds * 10) + time_since_SDOWN` are excluded\n- **Priority**: Lower `replica-priority` values are preferred (configurable in redis.conf)\n- **Replication offset**: Replicas with more data from the master are preferred\n- **Run ID**: Lexicographically smaller run ID as a tiebreaker\n\n**4. Promotion**\n- Sentinel sends `REPLICAOF NO ONE` command to the selected replica\n- The replica becomes the new master\n- Failover is considered successful once the role change is confirmed via `INFO` command\n\n**5. Configuration Propagation**\n- The successful Sentinel broadcasts the new configuration with an incremented version number (configuration epoch)\n- All Sentinels receive updates via the `__sentinel__:hello` Pub/Sub channel\n- Sentinels converge to the configuration with the highest version number\n- Other replicas are reconfigured to replicate from the new master\n- Clients are notified of the new master address\n\nThis distributed approach ensures high availability while preventing split-brain scenarios and maintaining consistency across the Sentinel cluster.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Sentinel as a distributed system, Quorum, Replica selection and priority, Configuration propagation]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "docs/eval-review.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "failover", "master", "cluster", "AOF", "replication", "replica", "OBJECT", "MULTI", "EVAL", "Lua"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "docs/eval-review.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "ade7d270-33fb-4b91-a8ee-20ba2a3faebb", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "3f56360f-a370-4a9d-8127-2dfbc1397948", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Redis Sentinel's automatic failover handling.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_5fJiy35EGE0TeWrMu8eQEN', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Sentinel automatic failover process', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_uhu3S1lk9s4ef3CIYunhdx', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'Sentinel.*failover|automatic failover'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_5fJiy35EGE0TeWrMu8eQEN', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.726,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis service discovery via Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel is a monitoring solution for Redis instances that handles\\\\\\\\nautomatic failover of Redis masters and service discovery (who is the current\\\\\\\\nmaster for a given group of instances?).

However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel.

Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties. In this document concepts will be introduced gradually\\\\\\\\nstarting from basic information needed in order to understand the basic\\\\\\\\nproperties of Sentinel, to more complex information (that are optional) in\\\\\\\\norder to understand how exactly Sentinel works.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.479,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-027\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Algorithms and internals > Configuration propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Once a Sentinel is able to failover a master successfully, it will start to broadcast the new configuration so that the other Sentinels will update their information about a given master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor a failover to be considered successful, it requires that the Sentinel was able to send the `REPLICAOF NO ONE` command to the selected replica, and that the switch to master was later observed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) output of the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt this point, even if the reconfiguration of the replicas is in progress, the failover is considered to be successful, and all the Sentinels are required to start reporting the new configuration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe way a new configuration is propagated is the reason why we need that every\\\\\\\\nSentinel failover is authorized with a different version number (configuration epoch).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery Sentinel continuously broadcast its version of the configuration of a master using Redis Pub/Sub messages, both in the master and all the replicas.  At the same time all the Sentinels wait for messages to see what is the configuration\\\\\\\\nadvertised by the other Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfigurations are broadcast in the `__sentinel__:hello` Pub/Sub channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause every configuration has a different version number, the greater version\\\\\\\\nalways wins over smaller versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example the configuration for the master `mymaster` start with all the\\\\\\\\nSentinels believing the master is at 192.168.1.50:6379. This configuration\\\\\\\\nhas version 1. After some time a Sentinel is authorized to failover with version 2. If the failover is successful, it will start to broadcast a new configuration, let\\'s say 192.168.1.50:9000, with version 2. All the other instances will see this configuration and will update their configuration accordingly, since the new configuration has a greater version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that Sentinel guarantees a second liveness property: a set of\\\\\\\\nSentinels that are able to communicate will all converge to the same configuration with the higher version number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically if the net is partitioned, every partition will converge to the higher\\\\\\\\nlocal configuration. In the special case of no partitions, there is a single\\\\\\\\npartition and every Sentinel will agree about the configuration.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8874,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-025\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Algorithms and internals > Quorum\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The previous sections showed that every master monitored by Sentinel is associated to a configured **quorum**. It specifies the number of Sentinel processes\\\\\\\\nthat need to agree about the unreachability or error condition of the master in\\\\\\\\norder to trigger a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, after the failover is triggered, in order for the failover to actually be performed, **at least a majority of Sentinels must authorize the Sentinel to\\\\\\\\nfailover**. Sentinel never performs a failover in the partition where a\\\\\\\\nminority of Sentinels exist.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s try to make things a bit more clear:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Quorum: the number of Sentinel processes that need to detect an error condition in order for a master to be flagged as **ODOWN**.\\\\\\\\n* The failover is triggered by the **ODOWN** state.\\\\\\\\n* Once the failover is triggered, the Sentinel trying to failover is required to ask for authorization to a majority of Sentinels (or more than the majority if the quorum is set to a number greater than the majority).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe difference may seem subtle but is actually quite simple to understand and use.  For example if you have 5 Sentinel instances, and the quorum is set to 2, a failover will be triggered as soon as 2 Sentinels believe that the master is not reachable, however one of the two Sentinels will be able to failover only if it gets authorization at least from 3 Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf instead the quorum is configured to 5, all the Sentinels must agree about the master error condition, and the authorization from all Sentinels is required in order to failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that the quorum can be used to tune Sentinel in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. If a quorum is set to a value smaller than the majority of Sentinels we deploy, we are basically making Sentinel more sensitive to master failures, triggering a failover as soon as even just a minority of Sentinels is no longer able to talk with the master.\\\\\\\\n2. If a quorum is set to a value greater than the majority of Sentinels, we are making Sentinel able to failover only when there are a very large number (larger than majority) of well connected Sentinels which agree about the master being down.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.5916,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-023\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > Replica selection and priority\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When a Sentinel instance is ready to perform a failover, since the master\\\\\\\\nis in `ODOWN` state and the Sentinel received the authorization to failover\\\\\\\\nfrom the majority of the Sentinel instances known, a suitable replica needs\\\\\\\\nto be selected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe replica selection process evaluates the following information about replicas:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Hash Slot 基本原理\n\nRedis Cluster 将整个键空间分为 **16384 个 hash slots**（编号 0-16383）。每个 key 通过以下算法映射到特定的 slot：\n\n```\nHASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\n```\n\n- 使用 CRC16 算法（XMODEM 变体）计算 key 的哈希值\n- 对 16384 取模，得到该 key 所属的 slot 编号\n\n## 2. 数据分片方式\n\n每个 master 节点负责一部分 hash slots。例如 3 节点集群：\n\n- **Node A**: 负责 slots 0-5500\n- **Node B**: 负责 slots 5501-11000  \n- **Node C**: 负责 slots 11001-16383\n\n当客户端访问某个 key 时，先计算其 hash slot，然后路由到负责该 slot 的节点。\n\n## 3. Hash Tags（哈希标签）\n\n为了支持多 key 操作，Redis Cluster 提供 hash tags 机制，确保多个 key 映射到同一个 slot：\n\n- 如果 key 包含 `{...}` 模式，只对花括号内的内容计算哈希\n- 例如：`{user1000}.following` 和 `{user1000}.followers` 会映射到同一 slot（只哈希 `user1000`）\n\n**规则**：\n- key 中有 `{` 字符\n- `{` 右侧有 `}` 字符\n- 第一个 `{` 和第一个 `}` 之间有内容\n\n则只哈希花括号内的内容。\n\n## 4. 动态扩缩容\n\n添加/删除节点时，只需 **迁移 hash slots**：\n\n- **添加节点 D**：从 A、B、C 各移动部分 slots 到 D\n- **删除节点 A**：将 A 的 slots 迁移到 B、C\n- 迁移过程中集群保持可用，无需停机\n\n迁移通过 `CLUSTER SETSLOT` 命令实现，使用 `MIGRATING` 和 `IMPORTING` 状态协调数据搬迁。\n\n## 5. 配置传播机制\n\nHash slot 分配信息通过两种方式在集群中传播：\n\n1. **心跳消息**：每个节点在 ping/pong 包中携带自己负责的 slots 信息\n2. **UPDATE 消息**：当节点发现其他节点信息过期时，主动发送更新\n\n配置更新遵循 **\"last failover wins\"** 原则：拥有最大 `configEpoch` 的节点声明的 slot 归属最终生效。\n\n---\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md > Key distribution model]**  \n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md > Hash tags]**  \n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md > Redis Cluster master-replica model]**  \n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md > Live reconfiguration]**", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["failover", "master", "cluster", "hash slot", "16384", "user", "replica"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "376af47e-2a05-454f-bba9-8ca2c02aceb0", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "fb050f6e-aa7e-4888-838d-6db231db34be", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我会并行使用 Grep 和 hybrid_search 来检索 Redis cluster 数据分片和 hash slot 的相关信息。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_JPl1e3XzWYXqRp2HOMGxQq', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'hash slot|数据分片|cluster.*shard'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_O3u7pfZQvNBB4dAENaCrDI', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis cluster 数据分片 hash slot 机制', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_JPl1e3XzWYXqRp2HOMGxQq', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_O3u7pfZQvNBB4dAENaCrDI', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.689,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-025\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration handling, propagation, and failovers > Hash slots configuration propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"An important part of Redis Cluster is the mechanism used to propagate the information about which cluster node is serving a given set of hash slots. This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.8117,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Hash tags\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"There is an exception for the computation of the hash slot that is used in order\\\\\\\\nto implement **hash tags**. Hash tags are a way to ensure that multiple keys\\\\\\\\nare allocated in the same hash slot. This is used in order to implement\\\\\\\\nmulti-key operations in Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo implement hash tags, the hash slot for a key is computed in a\\\\\\\\nslightly different way in certain conditions.\\\\\\\\nIf the key contains a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{...}\\\\\\\\\\\\\" pattern only the substring between\\\\\\\\n`{` and `}` is hashed in order to obtain the hash slot. However since it is\\\\\\\\npossible that there are multiple occurrences of `{` or `}` the algorithm is\\\\\\\\nwell specified by the following rules:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* IF the key contains a `{` character.\\\\\\\\n* AND IF there is a `}` character to the right of `{`.\\\\\\\\n* AND IF there are one or more characters between the first occurrence of `{` and the first occurrence of `}`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen instead of hashing the key, only what is between the first occurrence of `{` and the following first occurrence of `}` is hashed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExamples:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The two keys `{user1000}.following` and `{user1000}.followers` will hash to the same hash slot since only the substring `user1000` will be hashed in order to compute the hash slot.\\\\\\\\n* For the key `foo{}{bar}` the whole key will be hashed as usual since the first occurrence of `{` is followed by `}` on the right without characters in the middle.\\\\\\\\n* For the key `foo{{bar}}zap` the substring `{bar` will be hashed, because it is the substring between the first occurrence of `{` and the first occurrence of `}` on its right.\\\\\\\\n* For the key `foo{bar}{zap}` the substring `bar` will be hashed, since the algorithm stops at the first valid or invalid (without bytes inside) match of `{` and `}`.\\\\\\\\n* What follows from the algorithm is that if the key starts with `{}`, it is guaranteed to be hashed as a whole.

For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.5445,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > Live reconfiguration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster supports the ability to add and remove nodes while the cluster\\\\\\\\nis running. Adding or removing a node is abstracted into the same\\\\\\\\noperation: moving a hash slot from one node to another. This means\\\\\\\\nthat the same basic mechanism can be used in order to rebalance the cluster, add\\\\\\\\nor remove nodes, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To add a new node to the cluster an empty node is added to the cluster and some set of hash slots are moved from existing nodes to the new node.\\\\\\\\n* To remove a node from the cluster the hash slots assigned to that node are moved to other existing nodes.\\\\\\\\n* To rebalance the cluster a given set of hash slots are moved between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe core of the implementation is the ability to move hash slots around.\\\\\\\\nFrom a practical point of view a hash slot is just a set of keys, so\\\\\\\\nwhat Redis Cluster really does during *resharding* is to move keys from\\\\\\\\nan instance to another instance. Moving a hash slot means moving all the keys\\\\\\\\nthat happen to hash into this hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo understand how this works we need to show the [`CLUSTER`](/commands/cluster) subcommands\\\\\\\\nthat are used to manipulate the slots translation table in a Redis Cluster node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following subcommands are available (among others not useful in this case):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) slot1 [slot2] ...

Assigning a slot means to tell a given\\\\\\\\nmaster node that it will be in charge of storing and serving content for\\\\\\\\nthe specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the hash slots are assigned they will propagate across the cluster\\\\\\\\nusing the gossip protocol, as specified later in the\\\\\\\\n*configuration propagation* section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `ADDSLOTS` and `ADDSLOTSRANGE` commands are usually used when a new cluster is created\\\\\\\\nfrom scratch to assign each master node a subset of all the 16384 hash\\\\\\\\nslots available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `DELSLOTS`  and `DELSLOTSRANGE` are mainly used for manual modification of a cluster configuration\\\\\\\\nor for debugging tasks: in practice it is rarely used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `SETSLOT` subcommand is used to assign a slot to a specific node ID if\\\\\\\\nthe `SETSLOT <slot> NODE` form is used. Otherwise the slot can be set in the\\\\\\\\ntwo special states `MIGRATING` and `IMPORTING`. Those two special states\\\\\\\\nare used in order to migrate a hash slot from one node to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as MIGRATING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the key in question\\\\\\\\nexists, otherwise the query is forwarded using a `-ASK` redirection to the\\\\\\\\nnode that is target of the migration.\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as IMPORTING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the request is\\\\\\\\npreceded by an [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command. If the [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command was not given\\\\\\\\nby the client, the query is redirected to the real hash slot owner via\\\\\\\\na `-MOVED` redirection error, as would happen normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s make this clearer with an example of hash slot migration.\\\\\\\\nAssume that we have two Redis master nodes, called A and B.\\\\\\\\nWe want to move hash slot 8 from A to B, so we issue commands like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We send B: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 IMPORTING A\\\\\\\\n* We send A: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 MIGRATING B\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll the other nodes will continue to point clients to node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" every time\\\\\\\\nthey are queried with a key that belongs to hash slot 8, so what happens\\\\\\\\nis that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* All queries about existing keys are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* All queries about non-existing keys in A are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\", because \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will redirect clients to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis way we no longer create new keys in \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\nIn the meantime, `redis-cli` used during reshardings\\\\\\\\nand Redis Cluster configuration will migrate existing keys in\\\\\\\\nhash slot 8 from A to B.\\\\\\\\nThis is performed using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT slot count\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will return `count` keys in the specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\nFor keys returned, `redis-cli` sends node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) command, that\\\\\\\\nwill migrate the specified keys from A to B in an atomic way (both instances\\\\\\\\nare locked for the time (usually very small time) needed to migrate keys so\\\\\\\\nthere are no race conditions). This is how [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    MIGRATE target_host target_port \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\" target_database id timeout KEYS key1 key2 ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) will connect to the target instance, send a serialized version of\\\\\\\\nthe key, and once an OK code is received, the old key from its own dataset\\\\\\\\nwill be deleted. From the point of view of an external client a key exists\\\\\\\\neither in A or B at any given time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis Cluster there is no need to specify a database other than 0, but\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is a general command that can be used for other tasks not\\\\\\\\ninvolving Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is optimized to be as fast as possible even when moving complex\\\\\\\\nkeys such as long lists, but in Redis Cluster reconfiguring the\\\\\\\\ncluster where big keys are present is not considered a wise procedure if\\\\\\\\nthere are latency constraints in the application using the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the migration process is finally finished, the `SETSLOT <slot> NODE <node-id>` command is sent to the two nodes involved in the migration in order to\\\\\\\\nset the slots to their normal state again. The same command is usually\\\\\\\\nsent to all other nodes to avoid waiting for the natural\\\\\\\\npropagation of the new configuration across the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.7042,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Key distribution model\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The cluster\\'s key space is split into 16384 slots, effectively setting an upper limit\\\\\\\\nfor the cluster size of 16384 master nodes (however, the suggested max size of\\\\\\\\nnodes is on the order of ~ 1000 nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach master node in a cluster handles a subset of the 16384 hash slots.\\\\\\\\nThe cluster is **stable** when there is no cluster reconfiguration in\\\\\\\\nprogress (i.e. where hash slots are being moved from one node to another).\\\\\\\\nWhen the cluster is stable, a single hash slot will be served by a single node\\\\\\\\n(however the serving node can have one or more replicas that will replace it in the case of net splits or failures,\\\\\\\\nand that can be used in order to scale read operations where reading stale data is acceptable).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe base algorithm used to map keys to hash slots is the following\\\\\\\\n(read the next paragraph for the hash tag exception to this rule):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe CRC16 is specified as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\\\\\\\\n* Width: 16 bit\\\\\\\\n* Poly: 1021 (That is actually x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\\\\\\\\n* Initialization: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Input byte: False\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Output CRC: False\\\\\\\\n* Xor constant to output CRC: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Output for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"123456789\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 31C3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n14 out of 16 CRC16 output bits are used (this is why there is\\\\\\\\na modulo 16384 operation in the formula above).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our tests CRC16 behaved remarkably well in distributing different kinds of\\\\\\\\nkeys evenly across the 16384 slots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note**: A reference implementation of the CRC16 algorithm used is available in the Appendix A of this document.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Redis Cluster 通过 **hash slot（哈希槽）机制** 实现数据分片。以下是详细说明：\\n\\n## 1.

Redis provides a range of persistence options. These include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RDB** (Redis Database): RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.\\\\\\\\n* **AOF** (Append Only File): AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server. These operations can then be replayed again at server startup, reconstructing the original dataset. Commands are logged using the same format as the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n* **No persistence**: You can disable persistence completely. This is sometimes used when caching.\\\\\\\\n* **RDB + AOF**: You can also combine both AOF and RDB in the same instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\'d rather not think about the tradeoffs between these different persistence strategies, you may want to consider [Redis Software\\'s persistence options](), which can be pre-configured using a UI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about how to evaluate your Redis persistence strategy, read on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is a very compact single-file point-in-time representation of your Redis data. RDB files are perfect for backups. For instance you may want to archive your RDB files every hour for the latest 24 hours, and to save an RDB snapshot every day for 30 days. This allows you to easily restore different versions of the data set in case of disasters.\\\\\\\\n* RDB is very good for disaster recovery, being a single compact file that can be transferred to far data centers, or onto Amazon S3 (possibly encrypted).\\\\\\\\n* RDB maximizes Redis performances since the only work the Redis parent process needs to do in order to persist is forking a child that will do all the rest. The parent process will never perform disk I/O or alike.\\\\\\\\n* RDB allows faster restarts with big datasets compared to AOF.\\\\\\\\n* On replicas, RDB supports [partial resynchronizations after restarts and failovers]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is NOT good if you need to minimize the chance of data loss in case Redis stops working (for example after a power outage). You can configure different *save points* where an RDB is produced (for instance after at least five minutes and 100 writes against the data set, you can have multiple save points). However you\\'ll usually create an RDB snapshot every five minutes or more, so in case of Redis stopping working without a correct shutdown for any reason you should be prepared to lose the latest minutes of data.\\\\\\\\n* RDB needs to fork() often in order to persist on disk using a child process. fork() can be time consuming if the dataset is big, and may result in Redis stopping serving clients for some milliseconds or even for one second if the dataset is very big and the CPU performance is not great. AOF also needs to fork() but less frequently and you can tune how often you want to rewrite your logs without any trade-off on durability.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8847,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Append-only file > How I can switch to AOF, if I\\'m currently using dump.rdb snapshots?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If you want to enable AOF in a server that is currently using RDB snapshots, you need to convert the data by enabling AOF via CONFIG command on the live server first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT:** not following this procedure (e.g. just changing the config and restarting the server) can result in data loss!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis >= 2.2**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreparations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Make a backup of your latest dump.rdb file.\\\\\\\\n* Transfer this backup to a safe place.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSwitch to AOF on live database:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Enable AOF: `redis-cli config set appendonly yes`\\\\\\\\n* Optionally disable RDB: `redis-cli config set save \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`\\\\\\\\n* Make sure writes are appended to the append only file correctly.\\\\\\\\n* **IMPORTANT:** Update your `redis.conf` (potentially through [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite)) and ensure that it matches the configuration above.\\\\\\\\n  If you forget this step, when you restart the server, the configuration changes will be lost and the server will start again with the old configuration, resulting in a loss of your data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext time you restart the server:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Before restarting the server, wait for AOF rewrite to finish persisting the data.\\\\\\\\n  You can do that by watching `INFO persistence`, waiting for `aof_rewrite_in_progress` and `aof_rewrite_scheduled` to be `0`, and validating that `aof_last_bgrewrite_status` is `ok`.\\\\\\\\n* After restarting the server, check that your database contains the same number of keys it contained previously.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis 2.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Make a backup of your latest dump.rdb file.\\\\\\\\n* Transfer this backup into a safe place.\\\\\\\\n* Stop all the writes against the database!\\\\\\\\n* Issue a `redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF`.

This is what we suggest:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Create a cron job in your server creating hourly snapshots of the RDB file in one directory, and daily snapshots in a different directory.\\\\\\\\n* Every time the cron script runs, make sure to call the `find` command to make sure too old snapshots are deleted: for instance you can take hourly snapshots for the latest 48 hours, and daily snapshots for one or two months. Make sure to name the snapshots with date and time information.\\\\\\\\n* At least one time every day make sure to transfer an RDB snapshot *outside your data center* or at least *outside the physical machine* running your Redis instance.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.2302,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"AOF disadvantages\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Using AOF Redis is much more durable: you can have different fsync policies: no fsync at all, fsync every second, fsync at every query. With the default policy of fsync every second, write performance is still great. fsync is performed using a background thread and the main thread will try hard to perform writes when no fsync is in progress, so you can only lose one second worth of writes.\\\\\\\\n* The AOF log is an append-only log, so there are no seeks, nor corruption problems if there is a power outage. Even if the log ends with a half-written command for some reason (disk full or other reasons) the redis-check-aof tool is able to fix it easily.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is able to automatically rewrite the AOF in background when it gets too big. The rewrite is completely safe as while Redis continues appending to the old file, a completely new one is produced with the minimal set of operations needed to create the current data set, and once this second file is ready Redis switches the two and starts appending to the new one.\\\\\\\\n* AOF contains a log of all the operations one after the other in an easy to understand and parse format. You can even easily export an AOF file. For instance even if you\\'ve accidentally flushed everything using the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command, as long as no rewrite of the log was performed in the meantime, you can still save your data set just by stopping the server, removing the latest command, and restarting Redis again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF files are usually bigger than the equivalent RDB files for the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n* AOF can be slower than RDB depending on the exact fsync policy. In general with fsync set to *every second* performance is still very high, and with fsync disabled it should be exactly as fast as RDB even under high load. Still RDB is able to provide more guarantees about the maximum latency even in the case of a huge write load.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis < 7.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF can use a lot of memory if there are writes to the database during a rewrite (these are buffered in memory and written to the new AOF at the end).\\\\\\\\n* All write commands that arrive during rewrite are written to disk twice.\\\\\\\\n* Redis could freeze writing and fsyncing these write commands to the new AOF file at the end of the rewrite.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nOk, so what should I use?\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe general indication you should use both persistence methods is if\\\\\\\\nyou want a degree of data safety comparable to what PostgreSQL can provide you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you care a lot about your data, but still can live with a few minutes of\\\\\\\\ndata loss in case of disasters, you can simply use RDB alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are many users using AOF alone, but we discourage it since to have an\\\\\\\\nRDB snapshot from time to time is a great idea for doing database backups,\\\\\\\\nfor faster restarts, and in the event of bugs in the AOF engine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following sections will illustrate a few more details about the two persistence models.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8067,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis FAQ\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Why does Redis keep its entire dataset in memory?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Redis has a different evolution path in the key-value DBs where values can contain more complex data types, with atomic operations defined on those data types. Redis data types are closely related to fundamental data structures and are exposed to the programmer as such, without additional abstraction layers.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can\\'t be larger than memory. Another advantage of\\\\\\\\nin-memory databases is that the memory representation of complex data structures\\\\\\\\nis much simpler to manipulate compared to the same data structures on disk, so\\\\\\\\nRedis can do a lot with little internal complexity. At the same time the\\\\\\\\ntwo on-disk storage formats (RDB and AOF) don\\'t need to be suitable for random\\\\\\\\naccess, so they are compact and always generated in an append-only fashion\\\\\\\\n(Even the AOF log rotation is an append-only operation, since the new version\\\\\\\\nis generated from the copy of data in memory). However this design also involves\\\\\\\\ndifferent challenges compared to traditional on-disk stores. Being the main data\\\\\\\\nrepresentation on memory, Redis operations must be carefully handled to make sure\\\\\\\\nthere is always an updated version of the data set on disk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An empty instance uses ~ 3MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 85MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 160 MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting your use case is trivial. Use the `redis-benchmark` utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the `INFO memory` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n64-bit systems will use considerably more memory than 32-bit systems to store the same keys, especially if the keys and values are small. This is because pointers take 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. But of course the advantage is that you can\\\\\\\\nhave a lot of memory in 64-bit systems, so in order to run large Redis servers a 64-bit system is more or less required. The alternative is sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past the Redis developers experimented with Virtual Memory and other systems in order to allow larger than RAM datasets, but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well: data served from memory, disk used for storage. So for now there are no plans to create an on disk backend for Redis. Most of what\\\\\\\\nRedis is, after all, a direct result of its current design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf your real problem is not the total RAM needed, but the fact that you need\\\\\\\\nto split your data set into multiple Redis instances, please read the\\\\\\\\n[partitioning page]() in this documentation for more info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Ltd., the company sponsoring Redis development, has developed a\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis on Flash\\\\\\\\\\\\\" solution that uses a mixed RAM/flash approach for\\\\\\\\nlarger data sets with a biased access pattern.

Here's how to configure it:\n\n## Basic Configuration\n\nRedis ACL uses a DSL (domain specific language) to define user permissions. You can configure ACLs in two ways:\n\n1. **Directly in redis.conf**:\n```\nuser <username> ... acl rules ...\n```\n\n2. **External ACL file** (recommended for complex environments):\n```\naclfile /etc/redis/users.acl\n```\n\n## ACL Rule Format\n\nRules are applied left-to-right. Example:\n```\nuser worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99\n```\n\n## Key Components\n\n- **Authentication**: `AUTH <username> <password>` (Redis 6+)\n- **Default user**: New connections authenticate as \"default\" user automatically\n- **Backward compatibility**: Old `requirepass` directive now sets password for default user\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n1. **Security**: Restrict untrusted clients to read-only commands\n2. **Operational safety**: Prevent accidental data loss (e.g., block FLUSHALL for workers)\n3. **Managed instances**: Exclude configuration commands for customers\n\n## Managing ACLs\n\n- **View current ACLs**: `ACL LIST`\n- **Reload from file**: `ACL LOAD` (validates before applying)\n- **Save to file**: `ACL SAVE`\n- **Note**: `CONFIG REWRITE` doesn't trigger `ACL SAVE` when using external ACL file\n\n## Example: Sentinel User\n```\nACL SETUSER sentinel-user on >somepassword allchannels +multi +slaveof +ping +exec +subscribe +config|rewrite +role +publish +info +client|setname +client|kill +script|kill\n```\n\n## Example: Replica User\n```\nACL setuser replica-user on >somepassword +psync +replconf +ping\n```\n\n[来源:

ACL, short for Access Control List, is the feature that allows certain\\\\\\\\nconnections to be limited in terms of the commands that can be executed and the\\\\\\\\nkeys that can be accessed. The way it works is that, after connecting, a client\\\\\\\\nis required to provide a username and a valid password to authenticate. If authentication succeeded, the connection is associated with a given\\\\\\\\nuser and the limits the user has. Redis can be configured so that new\\\\\\\\nconnections are already authenticated with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\" user (this is the\\\\\\\\ndefault configuration). Configuring the default user has, as a side effect,\\\\\\\\nthe ability to provide only a specific subset of functionalities to connections\\\\\\\\nthat are not explicitly authenticated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the default configuration, Redis 6 (the first version to have ACLs) works\\\\\\\\nexactly like older versions of Redis. Every new connection is\\\\\\\\ncapable of calling every possible command and accessing every key, so the\\\\\\\\nACL feature is backward compatible with old clients and applications. Also\\\\\\\\nthe old way to configure a password, using the **requirepass** configuration\\\\\\\\ndirective, still works as expected. However, it now\\\\\\\\nsets a password for the default user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command was extended in Redis 6, so now it is possible to\\\\\\\\nuse it in the two-arguments form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <username> <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of the old form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat happens is that the username used to authenticate is \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so\\\\\\\\njust specifying the password implies that we want to authenticate against\\\\\\\\nthe default user. This provides backward compatibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore using ACLs, you may want to ask yourself what\\'s the goal you want to\\\\\\\\naccomplish by implementing this layer of protection. Normally there are\\\\\\\\ntwo main goals that are well served by ACLs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You want to improve security by restricting the access to commands and keys, so that untrusted clients have no access and trusted clients have just the minimum access level to the database in order to perform the work needed. For instance, certain clients may just be able to execute read only commands.\\\\\\\\n2. You want to improve operational safety, so that processes or humans accessing Redis are not allowed to damage the data or the configuration due to software errors or manual mistakes. For instance, there is no reason for a worker that fetches delayed jobs from Redis to be able to call the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother typical usage of ACLs is related to managed Redis instances. Redis is\\\\\\\\noften provided as a managed service both by internal company teams that handle\\\\\\\\nthe Redis infrastructure for the other internal customers they have, or is\\\\\\\\nprovided in a software-as-a-service setup by cloud providers. In both \\\\\\\\nsetups, we want to be sure that configuration commands are excluded for the\\\\\\\\ncustomers.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5007,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a0527f7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0a0527f7-031\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisstack 7.2 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Stack 7.2.0-v1 (September 2023) > Details:\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This version contains security fixes for the Redis server for cases when users may access keys that are not explicitly authorized by the ACL configuration using the [SORT_RO](https://redis.io/commands/sort_ro/) command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Security Fixes**\\\\\\\\n* **Redis**:\\\\\\\\n  * (CVE-2023-41053) Redis does not correctly identify keys accessed by SORT_RO and,\\\\\\\\nas a result, may grant users executing this command access to keys that are not\\\\\\\\nexplicitly authorized by the ACL configuration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bug Fixes**\\\\\\\\n* **Redis**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#12538](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12538) Fix crashes when joining a node to an existing 7.0 Redis Cluster\\\\\\\\n  * [#12545](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12545), [#12530](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12530) Correct request_policy and response_policy command tips on for some admin /\\\\\\\\nconfiguration commands\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis version**\\\\\\\\n* __[Redis 7.2.1](https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.2.1)__\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Module versions**\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n* __[RediSearch 2.8.4](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/releases/tag/v2.8.4)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisJSON 2.6.6](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/releases/tag/v2.6.6)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisTimeSeries 1.10.4](https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/releases/tag/v1.10.4)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisBloom 2.6.3](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom/releases/tag/v2.6.3)__\\\\\\\\n* __[RedisGears 2.0.11](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/releases/tag/v2.0.11-m12)__\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Recommended Client Libraries**\\\\\\\\n* Java\\\\\\\\n  * [Jedis 5.0.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/jedis/releases/tag/v5.0.0)\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-spring 0.8.7 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-spring/releases/tag/v0.8.7)\\\\\\\\n* Python\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-py 5.0.0 or greater ](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/releases/tag/v5.0.0)\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-python 0.2.1 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-python/releases/tag/v0.2.1)\\\\\\\\n* NodeJS\\\\\\\\n  * [node-redis 4.6.8 or greater](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/releases/tag/redis%404.6.8)\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-node 0.2.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-node/releases/tag/v0.2.0)\\\\\\\\n* .NET\\\\\\\\n  * [redis-om-dotnet 0.5.3 or greater](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-dotnet/releases/tag/v0.5.3)\\\\\\\\n  * [NRedisStack 0.9.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/NRedisStack/releases/tag/v0.9.0)\\\\\\\\n* Go\\\\\\\\n  * [go-redis 9.1.0 or greater](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/releases/tag/v9.1.0)\\\\\\\\n  * [rueidis 1.0.17 or greater](https://github.com/redis/rueidis/releases/tag/v1.0.17)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCompatible with [RedisInsight](https://redis.io/download).

RDB 文件生成完成后传输给从节点\n4. 从节点保存到磁盘并加载到内存\n5. 主节点发送缓冲的所有命令给从节点\n\n---\n\n## PSYNC 工作原理\n\nPSYNC（Partial Sync）是 Redis 用于智能同步的核心命令，取代了旧的 SYNC 命令。\n\n### 核心概念：Replication ID + Offset\n\n每个 Redis 主节点维护两个关键标识：\n\n- **Replication ID**：一个大型伪随机字符串，标记数据集的特定历史版本\n- **Replication Offset**：复制流的字节偏移量，每次产生复制数据时递增\n\n这两个值的组合 `(Replication ID, Offset)` 唯一标识主节点数据集的精确版本。\n\n### PSYNC 工作流程\n\n1. **从节点发起连接**：从节点使用 `PSYNC` 命令发送：\n   - 旧主节点的 Replication ID\n   - 已处理的 Offset\n\n2. **主节点判断同步方式**：\n   - **部分重同步**：如果主节点的 backlog 缓冲区包含从节点缺失的数据，只发送增量部分\n   - **完全重同步**：如果 backlog 不足或 Replication ID 不匹配，执行完整的 RDB 传输\n\n3. **双 Replication ID 机制**：\n   - 主节点维护 **主 ID** 和 **次 ID**\n   - 当从节点提升为主节点时，将旧的主 ID 保存为次 ID\n   - 这样其他从节点连接新主节点时，仍可使用旧主节点的 ID 进行部分重同步\n   - 避免故障转移后强制全量同步\n\n### 关键特性\n\n- **异步复制**：主节点不等待从节点确认，从节点定期向主节点报告已处理的数据量\n- **非阻塞**：主节点在同步期间仍可处理查询\n- **并发优化**：多个从节点同时请求同步时，主节点只执行一次后台保存\n\n---\n\n## 引用来源\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md > How Redis replication works]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "docs/progress-2025-02-13.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RDB", "replication", "replica", "PSYNC"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "docs/progress-2025-02-13.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "0caeac1d-e77e-43fa-b832-6ee181afaf3e", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "6e70446b-ab2e-4416-a933-106b571ddcda", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来检索 Redis 主从复制和 PSYNC 的相关信息。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_8MKg33unJJuL8eH9PjUokh', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis 主从复制 replication PSYNC 工作原理', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_ZatzLpogemRSKy2Vo6bSVL', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'PSYNC|主从复制|replication'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_8MKg33unJJuL8eH9PjUokh', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.6812,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"How Redis replication works\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Every Redis master has a replication ID: it is a large pseudo random string\\\\\\\\nthat marks a given history of the dataset. Each master also takes an offset that\\\\\\\\nincrements for every byte of replication stream that it is produced to be\\\\\\\\nsent to replicas, to update the state of the replicas with the new changes\\\\\\\\nmodifying the dataset. The replication offset is incremented even if no replica\\\\\\\\nis actually connected, so basically every given pair of:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Replication ID, offset\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdentifies an exact version of the dataset of a master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen replicas connect to masters, they use the [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) command to send\\\\\\\\ntheir old master replication ID and the offsets they processed so far. This way\\\\\\\\nthe master can send just the incremental part needed. However if there is not\\\\\\\\nenough *backlog* in the master buffers, or if the replica is referring to an\\\\\\\\nhistory (replication ID) which is no longer known, then a full resynchronization\\\\\\\\nhappens: in this case the replica will get a full copy of the dataset, from scratch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how a full synchronization works in more details:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe master starts a background saving process to produce an RDB file. At the same time it starts to buffer all new write commands received from the clients. When the background saving is complete, the master transfers the database file to the replica, which saves it on disk, and then loads it into memory. The master will then send all buffered commands to the replica. This is done as a stream of commands and is in the same format of the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can try it yourself via telnet. Connect to the Redis port while the\\\\\\\\nserver is doing some work and issue the [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) command. You\\'ll see a bulk\\\\\\\\ntransfer and then every command received by the master will be re-issued\\\\\\\\nin the telnet session. Actually [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) is an old protocol no longer used by\\\\\\\\nnewer Redis instances, but is still there for backward compatibility: it does\\\\\\\\nnot allow partial resynchronizations, so now [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) is used instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs already said, replicas are able to automatically reconnect when the master-replica link goes down for some reason. If the master receives multiple concurrent replica synchronization requests, it performs a single background save in to serve all of them.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2978,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Important facts about Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Redis uses asynchronous replication, with asynchronous replica-to-master acknowledges of the amount of data processed.\\\\\\\\n* A master can have multiple replicas.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas are able to accept connections from other replicas. Aside from connecting a number of replicas to the same master, replicas can also be connected to other replicas in a cascading-like structure. Since Redis 4.0, all the sub-replicas will receive exactly the same replication stream from the master.\\\\\\\\n* Redis replication is non-blocking on the master side. This means that the master will continue to handle queries when one or more replicas perform the initial synchronization or a partial resynchronization.\\\\\\\\n* Replication is also largely non-blocking on the replica side. While the replica is performing the initial synchronization, it can handle queries using the old version of the dataset, assuming you configured Redis to do so in redis.conf.  Otherwise, you can configure Redis replicas to return an error to clients if the replication stream is down. However, after the initial sync, the old dataset must be deleted and the new one must be loaded. The replica will block incoming connections during this brief window (that can be as long as many seconds for very large datasets). Since Redis 4.0 you can configure Redis so that the deletion of the old data set happens in a different thread, however loading the new initial dataset will still happen in the main thread and block the replica.\\\\\\\\n* Replication can be used both for scalability, to have multiple replicas for read-only queries (for example, slow O(N) operations can be offloaded to replicas), or simply for improving data safety and high availability.\\\\\\\\n* You can use replication to avoid the cost of having the master writing the full dataset to disk: a typical technique involves configuring your master `redis.conf` to avoid persisting to disk at all, then connect a replica configured to save from time to time, or with AOF enabled. However, this setup must be handled with care, since a restarting master will start with an empty dataset: if the replica tries to sync with it, the replica will be emptied as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.9901,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-005\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To configure basic Redis replication is trivial: just add the following line to the replica configuration file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    replicaof 192.168.1.1 6379\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOf course you need to replace 192.168.1.1 6379 with your master IP address (or\\\\\\\\nhostname) and port.

It allows replica Redis instances to be exact copies of master instances. The replica will automatically reconnect to the master every time the link breaks, and will attempt to be an exact copy of it *regardless* of what happens to the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis system works using three main mechanisms:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. When a master and a replica instance are well-connected, the master keeps the replica updated by sending a stream of commands to the replica to replicate the effects on the dataset happening on the master side due to: client writes, keys expired or evicted, any other action changing the master dataset.\\\\\\\\n2. When the link between the master and the replica breaks, for network issues or because a timeout is sensed in the master or the replica, the replica reconnects and attempts to proceed with a partial resynchronization: it means that it will try to just obtain the part of the stream of commands it missed during the disconnection.\\\\\\\\n3. When a partial resynchronization is not possible, the replica will ask for a full resynchronization. This will involve a more complex process in which the master needs to create a snapshot of all its data, send it to the replica, and then continue sending the stream of commands as the dataset changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses by default asynchronous replication, which being low latency and\\\\\\\\nhigh performance, is the natural replication mode for the vast majority of Redis\\\\\\\\nuse cases. However, Redis replicas asynchronously acknowledge the amount of data\\\\\\\\nthey receive periodically with the master. So the master does not wait every time\\\\\\\\nfor a command to be processed by the replicas, however it knows, if needed, what\\\\\\\\nreplica already processed what command. This allows having optional synchronous replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSynchronous replication of certain data can be requested by the clients using\\\\\\\\nthe [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) command. However [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) is only able to ensure there are the\\\\\\\\nspecified number of acknowledged copies in the other Redis instances, it does not\\\\\\\\nturn a set of Redis instances into a CP system with strong consistency: acknowledged\\\\\\\\nwrites can still be lost during a failover, depending on the exact configuration\\\\\\\\nof the Redis persistence. However, [WAIT]() dramatically reduces the probability of losing a write after a failure event to specific hard-to-trigger failure modes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can check the Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster documentation for more information\\\\\\\\nabout high availability and failover.

Such a feature depends\\\\\\\\non the ability of an instance to count the time, however Redis replicas correctly\\\\\\\\nreplicate keys with expires, even when such keys are altered using Lua\\\\\\\\nscripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo implement such a feature Redis cannot rely on the ability of the master and\\\\\\\\nreplica to have synced clocks, since this is a problem that cannot be solved\\\\\\\\nand would result in race conditions and diverging data sets, so Redis\\\\\\\\nuses three main techniques to make the replication of expired keys\\\\\\\\nable to work:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Replicas don\\'t expire keys, instead they wait for masters to expire the keys. When a master expires a key (or evict it because of LRU), it synthesizes a [`DEL`](/commands/del) command which is transmitted to all the replicas.\\\\\\\\n2. However because of master-driven expire, sometimes replicas may still have in memory keys that are already logically expired, since the master was not able to provide the [`DEL`](/commands/del) command in time. To deal with that the replica uses its logical clock to report that a key does not exist **only for read operations** that don\\'t violate the consistency of the data set (as new commands from the master will arrive). In this way replicas avoid reporting logically expired keys that are still existing. In practical terms, an HTML fragments cache that uses replicas to scale will avoid returning items that are already older than the desired time to live.\\\\\\\\n3. During Lua scripts executions no key expiries are performed. As a Lua script runs, conceptually the time in the master is frozen, so that a given key will either exist or not for all the time the script runs. This prevents keys expiring in the middle of a script, and is needed to send the same script to the replica in a way that is guaranteed to have the same effects in the data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce a replica is promoted to a master it will start to expire keys independently, and will not require any help from its old master.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3938,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Diskless replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In the previous section we said that if two instances have the same replication\\\\\\\\nID and replication offset, they have exactly the same data. However it is useful\\\\\\\\nto understand what exactly is the replication ID, and why instances have actually\\\\\\\\ntwo replication IDs: the main ID and the secondary ID.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA replication ID basically marks a given *history* of the data set. Every time\\\\\\\\nan instance restarts from scratch as a master, or a replica is promoted to master,\\\\\\\\na new replication ID is generated for this instance. The replicas connected to\\\\\\\\na master will inherit its replication ID after the handshake. So two instances\\\\\\\\nwith the same ID are related by the fact that they hold the same data, but\\\\\\\\npotentially at a different time. It is the offset that works as a logical time\\\\\\\\nto understand, for a given history (replication ID), who holds the most updated\\\\\\\\ndata set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, if two instances A and B have the same replication ID, but one\\\\\\\\nwith offset 1000 and one with offset 1023, it means that the first lacks certain\\\\\\\\ncommands applied to the data set. It also means that A, by applying just a few\\\\\\\\ncommands, may reach exactly the same state of B.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why Redis instances have two replication IDs is because of replicas\\\\\\\\nthat are promoted to masters. After a failover, the promoted replica requires\\\\\\\\nto still remember what was its past replication ID, because such replication ID\\\\\\\\nwas the one of the former master. In this way, when other replicas will sync\\\\\\\\nwith the new master, they will try to perform a partial resynchronization using the\\\\\\\\nold master replication ID. This will work as expected, because when the replica\\\\\\\\nis promoted to master it sets its secondary ID to its main ID, remembering what\\\\\\\\nwas the offset when this ID switch happened. Later it will select a new random\\\\\\\\nreplication ID, because a new history begins. When handling the new replicas\\\\\\\\nconnecting, the master will match their IDs and offsets both with the current\\\\\\\\nID and the secondary ID (up to a given offset, for safety). In short this means\\\\\\\\nthat after a failover, replicas connecting to the newly promoted master don\\'t have\\\\\\\\nto perform a full sync.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn case you wonder why a replica promoted to master needs to change its\\\\\\\\nreplication ID after a failover: it is possible that the old master is still\\\\\\\\nworking as a master because of some network partition: retaining the same\\\\\\\\nreplication ID would violate the fact that the same ID and same offset of any\\\\\\\\ntwo random instances mean they have the same data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally a full resynchronization requires creating an RDB file on disk,\\\\\\\\nthen reloading the same RDB from disk to feed the replicas with the data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith slow disks this can be a very stressing operation for the master.\\\\\\\\nRedis version 2.8.18 is the first version to have support for diskless\\\\\\\\nreplication. In this setup the child process directly sends the\\\\\\\\nRDB over the wire to replicas, without using the disk as intermediate storage.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6767,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Read-only replica\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Since Redis 2.6, replicas support a read-only mode that is enabled by default.\\\\\\\\nThis behavior is controlled by the `replica-read-only` option in the redis.conf file, and can be enabled and disabled at runtime using [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRead-only replicas will reject all write commands, so that it is not possible to write to a replica because of a mistake. This does not mean that the feature is intended to expose a replica instance to the internet or more generally to a network where untrusted clients exist, because administrative commands like [`DEBUG`](/commands/debug) or [`CONFIG`](/commands/config) are still enabled. The [Security]() page describes how to secure a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may wonder why it is possible to revert the read-only setting\\\\\\\\nand have replica instances that can be targeted by write operations.\\\\\\\\nThe answer is that writable replicas exist only for historical reasons.\\\\\\\\nUsing writable replicas can result in inconsistency between the master and the replica, so it is not recommended to use writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nTo understand in which situations this can be a problem, we need to understand how replication works.\\\\\\\\nChanges on the master is replicated by propagating regular Redis commands to the replica.\\\\\\\\nWhen a key expires on the master, this is propagated as a DEL command.\\\\\\\\nIf a key which exists on the master but is deleted, expired or has a different type on the replica compared to the master will react differently to commands like DEL, INCR or RPOP propagated from the master than intended.\\\\\\\\nThe propagated command may fail on the replica or result in a different outcome.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risks (if you insist on using writable replicas) we suggest you follow these recommendations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t write to keys in a writable replica that are also used on the master.\\\\\\\\n  (This can be hard to guarantee if you don\\'t have control over all the clients that write to the master.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica as an intermediary step when upgrading a set of instances in a running system.\\\\\\\\n  In general, don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica if it can ever be promoted to a master if you want to guarantee data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHistorically, there were some use cases that were considered legitimate for writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, these use cases are now all obsolete and the same can be achieved by other means.\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Computing slow Set or Sorted set operations and storing the result in temporary local keys using commands like [`SUNIONSTORE`](/commands/sunionstore) and [`ZINTERSTORE`](/commands/zinterstore).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use commands that return the result without storing it, such as [`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and [`ZINTER`](/commands/zinter).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using the [`SORT`](/commands/sort) command (which is not considered a read-only command because of the optional STORE option and therefore cannot be used on a read-only replica).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`SORT_RO`](/commands/sort_ro), which is a read-only command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using [`EVAL`](/commands/eval) and [`EVALSHA`](/commands/evalsha) are also not considered read-only commands, because the Lua script may call write commands.\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`EVAL_RO`](/commands/eval_ro) and [`EVALSHA_RO`](/commands/evalsha_ro) where the Lua script can only call read-only commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile writes to a replica will be discarded if the replica and the master resync or if the replica is restarted, there is no guarantee that they will sync automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore version 4.0, writable replicas were incapable of expiring keys with a time to live set.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if you use [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) or other commands that set a maximum TTL for a key, the key will leak, and while you may no longer see it while accessing it with read commands, you will see it in the count of keys and it will still use memory.\\\\\\\\nRedis 4.0 RC3 and greater versions are able to evict keys with TTL as masters do, with the exceptions of keys written in DB numbers greater than 63 (but by default Redis instances only have 16 databases).\\\\\\\\nNote though that even in versions greater than 4.0, using [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) on a key that could ever exists on the master can cause inconsistency between the replica and the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that since Redis 4.0 replica writes are only local, and are not propagated to sub-replicas attached to the instance. Sub-replicas instead will always receive the replication stream identical to the one sent by the top-level master to the intermediate replicas. So for example in the following setup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    A ---> B ---> C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if `B` is writable, C will not see `B` writes and will instead have identical dataset as the master instance `A`.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6004,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-027\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration handling, propagation, and failovers > Replica migration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster implements a concept called *replica migration* in order to\\\\\\\\nimprove the availability of the system. The idea is that in a cluster with\\\\\\\\na master-replica setup, if the map between replicas and masters is fixed\\\\\\\\navailability is limited over time if multiple independent failures of single\\\\\\\\nnodes happen.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example in a cluster where every master has a single replica, the cluster\\\\\\\\ncan continue operations as long as either the master or the replica fail, but not\\\\\\\\nif both fail the same time. However there is a class of failures that are\\\\\\\\nthe independent failures of single nodes caused by hardware or software issues\\\\\\\\nthat can accumulate over time. For example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A has a single replica A1.\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted as new master.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails in an independent manner (unrelated to the failure of A). No other replica is available for promotion since node A is still down. The cluster cannot continue normal operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the map between masters and replicas is fixed, the only way to make the cluster\\\\\\\\nmore resistant to the above scenario is to add replicas to every master, however\\\\\\\\nthis is costly as it requires more instances of Redis to be executed, more\\\\\\\\nmemory, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn alternative is to create an asymmetry in the cluster, and let the cluster\\\\\\\\nlayout automatically change over time. For example the cluster may have three\\\\\\\\nmasters A, B, C. A and B have a single replica each, A1 and B1. However the master\\\\\\\\nC is different and has two replicas: C1 and C2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReplica migration is the process of automatic reconfiguration of a replica\\\\\\\\nin order to *migrate* to a master that has no longer coverage (no working\\\\\\\\nreplicas). With replica migration the scenario mentioned above turns into the\\\\\\\\nfollowing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted.\\\\\\\\n* C2 migrates as replica of A1, that is otherwise not backed by any replica.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails as well.\\\\\\\\n* C2 is promoted as new master to replace A1.\\\\\\\\n* The cluster can continue the operations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4997,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Safety of replication when master has persistence turned off\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In setups where Redis replication is used, it is strongly advised to have\\\\\\\\npersistence turned on in the master and in the replicas.

We have a setup with node A acting as master, with persistence turned down, and nodes B and C replicating from node A.\\\\\\\\n2.

Use `LATENCY DOCTOR` for human-readable analysis.\n\n**2. Measure Baseline Latency**\n```bash\nredis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\n```\nRun this on the server (not client) to measure OS/hypervisor baseline latency.\n\n**3. Check for Slow Commands**\n```bash\nSLOWLOG GET 10\n```\nIdentifies blocking commands like `KEYS`, `SORT`, `SUNION` on large datasets.\n\n**4. Monitor Latency Events**\n- `LATENCY LATEST` - recent latency samples\n- `LATENCY HISTORY <event>` - time series for specific events\n- `LATENCY GRAPH <event>` - ASCII visualization\n\n## Common Causes & Fixes\n\n**Slow Commands**\n- ❌ Avoid `KEYS` in production (use `SCAN` instead)\n- ❌ Avoid O(N) commands on large datasets\n- Use replicas for expensive queries\n\n**Transparent Huge Pages**\n```bash\necho never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\n```\nThis is critical - THP causes massive latency spikes during fork operations.\n\n**Swapping**\nCheck if Redis memory is swapped:\n```bash\ncat /proc/$(pidof redis-server)/smaps | grep 'Swap:'\n```\nFix: Add more RAM or reduce memory pressure.\n\n**Fork Operations (BGSAVE/AOF rewrite)**\n- Use HVM-based EC2 instances (not Xen)\n- On VMs, expect 10-400ms fork time per GB\n- Disable AOF or use `appendfsync everysec`\n\n**AOF Persistence**\nDurability vs latency tradeoffs:\n1. `appendfsync always` - slowest, strongest durability\n2. `appendfsync everysec` - good compromise (recommended)\n3. `appendfsync no` - fastest, weakest durability\n4. Add `no-appendfsync-on-rewrite yes` to reduce disk pressure\n\n**Expiration Cycles**\nIf >25% of keys expire in the same second, Redis blocks to clean them up. Avoid using `EXPIREAT` with identical timestamps.\n\n**Network Latency**\n- Use Unix domain sockets if client is on same host\n- Use pipelining to reduce round trips\n- Keep connections

number of queries per second per instance, but also has strict latency requirements for the average response\\\\\\\\ntime and the worst-case latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile Redis is an in-memory system, it deals with the operating system in\\\\\\\\ndifferent ways, for example, in the context of persisting to disk.\\\\\\\\nMoreover Redis implements a rich set of commands. Certain commands\\\\\\\\nare fast and run in constant or logarithmic time. Other commands are slower\\\\\\\\nO(N) commands that can cause latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, Redis is single threaded. This is usually an advantage\\\\\\\\nfrom the point of view of the amount of work it can perform per core, and in\\\\\\\\nthe latency figures it is able to provide. However, it poses\\\\\\\\na challenge for latency, since the single\\\\\\\\nthread must be able to perform certain tasks incrementally, for\\\\\\\\nexample key expiration, in a way that does not impact the other clients\\\\\\\\nthat are served.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor all these reasons, Redis 2.8.13 introduced a new feature called\\\\\\\\n**Latency Monitoring**, that helps the user to check and troubleshoot possible\\\\\\\\nlatency problems. Latency monitoring is composed of the following conceptual\\\\\\\\nparts:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Latency hooks that sample different latency-sensitive code paths.\\\\\\\\n* Time series recording of latency spikes, split by different events.\\\\\\\\n* Reporting engine to fetch raw data from the time series.\\\\\\\\n* Analysis engine to provide human-readable reports and hints according to the measurements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe rest of this document covers the latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\ndetails.

Other events are less generic and monitor\\\\\\\\nspecific operations performed by Redis. For example, the `fork` event\\\\\\\\nonly monitors the time taken by Redis to execute the `fork(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA latency spike is an event that takes more time to run than the configured latency\\\\\\\\nthreshold. There is a separate time series associated with every monitored\\\\\\\\nevent. This is how the time series work:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time a latency spike happens, it is logged in the appropriate time series.\\\\\\\\n* Every time series is composed of 160 elements.\\\\\\\\n* Each element is a pair made of a Unix timestamp of the time the latency spike was measured and the number of milliseconds the event took to execute.\\\\\\\\n* Latency spikes for the same event that occur in the same second are merged by taking the maximum latency. Even if continuous latency spikes are measured for a given event, which could happen with a low threshold, at least 160 seconds of history are available.\\\\\\\\n* Records the all-time maximum latency for every element.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe framework monitors and logs latency spikes in the execution time of these events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `command`: regular commands.\\\\\\\\n* `fast-command`: O(1) and O(log N) commands.\\\\\\\\n* `fork`: the `fork(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n* `rdb-unlink-temp-file`: the `unlink(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-fsync-always`: the `fsync(2)` system call when invoked by the `appendfsync allways` policy.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write`: writing to the AOF - a catchall event for `write(2)` system calls.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write-pending-fsync`: the `write(2)` system call when there is a pending fsync.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write-active-child`: the `write(2)` system call when there are active child processes.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write-alone`: the `write(2)` system call when no pending fsync and no active child process.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-fstat`: the `fstat(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-rename`: the `rename(2)` system call for renaming the temporary file after completing [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof).\\\\\\\\n* `aof-rewrite-diff-write`: writing the differences accumulated while performing [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof).\\\\\\\\n* `active-defrag-cycle`: the active defragmentation cycle.\\\\\\\\n* `expire-cycle`: the expiration cycle.\\\\\\\\n* `eviction-cycle`: the eviction cycle.\\\\\\\\n* `eviction-del`: deletes during the eviction cycle.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.8394,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1d4c65d2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1d4c65d2-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/troubleshooting.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Troubleshooting Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"List of known Linux related bugs affecting Redis.\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This page tries to help you with what to do if you have issues with Redis.

Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for. However\\\\\\\\nthere is not just a single swap field since the smaps file contains the\\\\\\\\ndifferent memory maps of our Redis process (The memory layout of a process\\\\\\\\nis more complex than a simple linear array of pages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince we are interested in all the memory swapped by our process the first thing\\\\\\\\nto do is to grep for the Swap field across all the file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | grep \\'Swap:\\'\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf everything is 0 kB, or if there are sporadic 4k entries, everything is\\\\\\\\nperfectly normal.

If this is the case with your\\\\\\\\nRedis instance you can further verify it using the **vmstat** command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ vmstat 1\\\\\\\\n    procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----\\\\\\\\n     r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697932 147180 1406456    0    0     2     2    2    0  4  4 91  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697428 147180 1406580    0    0     0     0 19088 16104  9  6 84  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697296 147180 1406616    0    0     0    28 18936 16193  7  6 87  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697048 147180 1406640    0    0     0     0 18613 15987  6  6 88  0\\\\\\\\n     2  0   3980 696924 147180 1406656    0    0     0     0 18744 16299  6  5 88  0\\\\\\\\n     0  0   3980 697048 147180 1406688    0    0     0     4 18520 15974  6  6 88  0\\\\\\\\n    ^C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe interesting part of the output for our needs are the two columns **si**\\\\\\\\nand **so**, that counts the amount of memory swapped from/to the swap file.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server. The stack trace is different if the server blocks in a different context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you happen to collect multiple watchdog stack traces you are encouraged to send everything to the Redis Google Group: the more traces we obtain, the simpler it will be to understand what the problem with your instance is.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5054,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency-monitor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis latency monitoring\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Report information with the LATENCY command\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"What is high latency for one use case may not be considered high latency for another.

Only events that take longer than the specified threshold will be logged as latency spikes. The user should set the threshold according to their needs.

While the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe user interface to the latency monitoring subsystem is the [`LATENCY`](/commands/latency) command.\\\\\\\\nLike many other Redis commands, [`LATENCY`](/commands/latency) accepts subcommands that modify its behavior. These subcommands are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY LATEST`](/commands/latency-latest) - returns the latest latency samples for all events.\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY HISTORY`](/commands/latency-history) - returns latency time series for a given event.\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY RESET`](/commands/latency-reset) - resets latency time series data for one or more events.\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY GRAPH`](/commands/latency-graph) - renders an ASCII-art graph of an event\\'s latency samples.\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) - replies with a human-readable latency analysis report.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRefer to each subcommand\\'s documentation page for further information.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.0334,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/admin.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis administration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis setup tips > Replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Deploy Redis using the Linux operating system. Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.6113,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search/query-performance-factor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Query Performance Factor\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Monitoring Redis Query Engine\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To monitor a database with a query performance factor configured:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.6765,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b1c1a56c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b1c1a56c-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisearch/redisearch-1.6-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisearch 1.6 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.6 GA (January 2020)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This is the General Availability Release of RediSearch 1.6 (v1.6.7).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHeadlines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Several performance improvements increasing full-text search queries up to 60% and aggregation queries up to 73%.\\\\\\\\n- Support for aliasing of indices.\\\\\\\\n- Low-level API in C (and [Rust bindings](https://github.com/RediSearch/redisearch-api-rs)) to make RediSearch embeddable in other Redis modules.

This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory error for write commands if and when it reaches the \\\\\\\\nlimit - which in turn may result in errors in the application but will not render the \\\\\\\\nwhole machine dead because of memory starvation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.0146,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Special encoding of small aggregate data types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Since Redis 2.2 many data types are optimized to use less space up to a certain size.\\\\\\\\nHashes, Lists, Sets composed of just integers, and Sorted Sets, when smaller than a given number of elements, and up to a maximum element size, are encoded in a very memory-efficient way that uses *up to 10 times less memory* (with 5 times less memory used being the average saving).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is completely transparent from the point of view of the user and API.\\\\\\\\nSince this is a CPU / memory tradeoff it is possible to tune the maximum \\\\\\\\nnumber of elements and maximum element size for special encoded types \\\\\\\\nusing the following redis.conf directives (defaults are shown):\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.9398,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Using hashes to abstract a very memory-efficient plain key-value store on top of Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"I understand the title of this section is a bit scary, but I\\'m going to explain in detail what this is about.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically it is possible to model a plain key-value store using Redis\\\\\\\\nwhere values can just be just strings, which is not just more memory efficient\\\\\\\\nthan Redis plain keys but also much more memory efficient than memcached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with some facts: a few keys use a lot more memory than a single key\\\\\\\\ncontaining a hash with a few fields. How is this possible? We use a trick.\\\\\\\\nIn theory to guarantee that we perform lookups in constant time\\\\\\\\n(also known as O(1) in big O notation) there is the need to use a data structure\\\\\\\\nwith a constant time complexity in the average case, like a hash table.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut many times hashes contain just a few fields. When hashes are small we can\\\\\\\\ninstead just encode them in an O(N) data structure, like a linear\\\\\\\\narray with length-prefixed key-value pairs. Since we do this only when N\\\\\\\\nis small, the amortized time for [`HGET`](/commands/hget) and [`HSET`](/commands/hset) commands is still O(1): the\\\\\\\\nhash will be converted into a real hash table as soon as the number of elements\\\\\\\\nit contains grows too large (you can configure the limit in redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis does not only work well from the point of view of time complexity, but\\\\\\\\nalso from the point of view of constant times since a linear array of key-value pairs happens to play very well with the CPU cache (it has a better\\\\\\\\ncache locality than a hash table).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since hash fields and values are not (always) represented as full-featured Redis objects, hash fields can\\'t have an associated time to live\\\\\\\\n(expire) like a real key, and can only contain a string. But we are okay with\\\\\\\\nthis, this was the intention anyway when the hash data type API was\\\\\\\\ndesigned (we trust simplicity more than features, so nested data structures\\\\\\\\nare not allowed, as expires of single fields are not allowed).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo hashes are memory efficient. This is useful when using hashes\\\\\\\\nto represent objects or to model other problems when there are group of\\\\\\\\nrelated fields. But what about if we have a plain key value business?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImagine we want to use Redis as a cache for many small objects, which can be JSON encoded objects, small HTML fragments, simple key -> boolean values\\\\\\\\nand so forth. Basically, anything is a string -> string map with small keys\\\\\\\\nand values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow let\\'s assume the objects we want to cache are numbered, like:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * object:102393\\\\\\\\n * object:1234\\\\\\\\n * object:5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what we can do. Every time we perform a\\\\\\\\nSET operation to set a new value, we actually split the key into two parts,\\\\\\\\none part used as a key, and the other part used as the field name for the hash. For instance, the\\\\\\\\nobject named \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:1234\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is actually split into:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* a Key named object:12\\\\\\\\n* a Field named 34\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo we use all the characters but the last two for the key, and the final\\\\\\\\ntwo characters for the hash field name. To set our key we use the following\\\\\\\\ncommand:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nHSET object:12 34 somevalue\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see every hash will end up containing 100 fields, which is an optimal compromise between CPU and memory saved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is another important thing to note, with this schema\\\\\\\\nevery hash will have more or\\\\\\\\nless 100 fields regardless of the number of objects we cached. This is because our objects will always end with a number and not a random string. In some way, the final number can be considered as a form of implicit pre-sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat about small numbers? Like object:2? We handle this case using just\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as a key name, and the whole number as the hash field name.\\\\\\\\nSo object:2 and object:10 will both end inside the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but one\\\\\\\\nas field name \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and one as \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow much memory do we save this way?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI used the following Ruby program to test how this works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```ruby\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'rubygems\\'\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'redis\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUSE_OPTIMIZATION = true\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef hash_get_key_field(key)\\\\\\\\n  s = key.split(\\':\\')\\\\\\\\n  if s[1].length > 2\\\\\\\\n    { key: s[0] + \\':\\' + s[1][0..-3], field: s[1][-2..-1] }\\\\\\\\n  else\\\\\\\\n    { key: s[0] + \\':\\', field: s[1] }\\\\\\\\n  end\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef hash_set(r, key, value)\\\\\\\\n  kf = hash_get_key_field(key)\\\\\\\\n  r.hset(kf[:key], kf[:field], value)\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef hash_get(r, key, value)\\\\\\\\n  kf = hash_get_key_field(key)\\\\\\\\n  r.hget(kf[:key], kf[:field], value)\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nr = Redis.new\\\\\\\\n(0..100_000).each do |id|\\\\\\\\n  key = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:#{id}\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n  if USE_OPTIMIZATION\\\\\\\\n    hash_set(r, key, \\'val\\')\\\\\\\\n  else\\\\\\\\n    r.set(key, \\'val\\')\\\\\\\\n  end\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the result against a 64 bit instance of Redis 2.2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * USE_OPTIMIZATION set to true: 1.7 MB of used memory\\\\\\\\n * USE_OPTIMIZATION set to false; 11 MB of used memory\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an order of magnitude, I think this makes Redis more or less the most\\\\\\\\nmemory efficient plain key value store out there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*WARNING*: for this to work, make sure that in your redis.conf you have\\\\\\\\nsomething like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nhash-max-zipmap-entries 256\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso remember to set the following field accordingly to the maximum size\\\\\\\\nof your keys and values:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nhash-max-zipmap-value 1024\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery time a hash exceeds the number of elements or element size specified\\\\\\\\nit will be converted into a real hash table, and the memory saving will be lost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may ask, why don\\'t you do this implicitly in the normal key space so that\\\\\\\\nI don\\'t have to care? There are two reasons: one is that we tend to make\\\\\\\\ntradeoffs explicit, and this is a clear tradeoff between many things: CPU,\\\\\\\\nmemory, and max element size. The second is that the top-level key space must\\\\\\\\nsupport a lot of interesting things like expires, LRU data, and so\\\\\\\\nforth so it is not practical to do this in a general way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut the Redis Way is that the user must understand how things work so that he can pick the best compromise and to understand how the system will\\\\\\\\nbehave exactly.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6567,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis FAQ\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Are Redis on-disk snapshots atomic?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Yes, a common design pattern involves taking very write-heavy small data\\\\\\\\nin Redis (and data you need the Redis data structures to model your problem\\\\\\\\nin an efficient way), and big *blobs* of data into an SQL or eventually\\\\\\\\nconsistent on-disk database. Similarly sometimes Redis is used in order to\\\\\\\\ntake in memory another copy of a subset of the same data stored in the on-disk\\\\\\\\ndatabase. This may look similar to caching, but actually is a more advanced model\\\\\\\\nsince normally the Redis dataset is updated together with the on-disk DB dataset,\\\\\\\\nand not refreshed on cache misses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA good practice is to consider memory consumption when mapping your logical data model to the physical data model within Redis. These considerations include using specific data types, key patterns, and normalization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeyond data modeling, there is more info in the [Memory Optimization page]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has built-in protections allowing the users to set a max limit on memory\\\\\\\\nusage, using the `maxmemory` option in the configuration file to put a limit\\\\\\\\nto the memory Redis can use. If this limit is reached, Redis will start to reply\\\\\\\\nwith an error to write commands (but will continue to accept read-only\\\\\\\\ncommands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also configure Redis to evict keys when the max memory limit\\\\\\\\nis reached. See the [eviction policy docs]() for more information on this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShort answer: `echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` :)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now the long one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis background saving schema relies on the copy-on-write semantic of the `fork` system call in\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems: Redis forks (creates a child process) that is an\\\\\\\\nexact copy of the parent. The child process dumps the DB on disk and finally\\\\\\\\nexits. In theory the child should use as much memory as the parent being a\\\\\\\\ncopy, but actually thanks to the copy-on-write semantic implemented by most\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems the parent and child process will _share_ the common\\\\\\\\nmemory pages. A page will be duplicated only when it changes in the child or in\\\\\\\\nthe parent. Since in theory all the pages may change while the child process is\\\\\\\\nsaving, Linux can\\'t tell in advance how much memory the child will take, so if\\\\\\\\nthe `overcommit_memory` setting is set to zero the fork will fail unless there is\\\\\\\\nas much free RAM as required to really duplicate all the parent memory pages.\\\\\\\\nIf you have a Redis dataset of 3 GB and just 2 GB of free\\\\\\\\nmemory it will fail.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSetting `overcommit_memory` to 1 tells Linux to relax and perform the fork in a\\\\\\\\nmore optimistic allocation fashion, and this is indeed what you want for Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can refer to the [proc(5)][proc5] man page for explanations of the\\\\\\\\navailable values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[proc5]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, the Redis background saving process is always forked when the server is\\\\\\\\noutside of the execution of a command, so every command reported to be atomic\\\\\\\\nin RAM is also atomic from the point of view of the disk snapshot.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6135,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process. These functions can be executed on-demand, by an event-driven trigger, or by a stream processing trigger. Triggers and functions empowers developers to build and maintain real-time applications by moving logic closer to the data, ensuring a lower latency whilst delivering the best developer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry it out with the [triggers and functions quick start](https://redis.io/docs/interact/programmability/triggers-and-functions/quick_start/).\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.9381,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/admin.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis administration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis setup tips > Replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Deploy Redis using the Linux operating system. Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4785,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"String objects APIs > `RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation`\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"void RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation(RedisModuleString *str);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 7.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTrim possible excess memory allocated for a `RedisModuleString`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes a `RedisModuleString` may have more memory allocated for\\\\\\\\nit than required, typically for argv arguments that were constructed\\\\\\\\nfrom network buffers.

Setting `port 0` disables the non-TLS port completely. You can also run both TLS and non-TLS simultaneously on different ports.\n\n### Client Authentication\n\nBy default, Redis uses mutual TLS and requires clients to authenticate with a valid certificate. To disable client authentication:\n\n```\ntls-auth-clients no\n```\n\n## Starting Redis with TLS\n\nExample command to start Redis server with TLS:\n\n```bash\n./src/redis-server --tls-port 6379 --port 0 \\\n    --tls-cert-file ./tests/tls/redis.crt \\\n    --tls-key-file ./tests/tls/redis.key \\\n    --tls-ca-cert-file ./tests/tls/ca.crt\n```\n\n## Connecting with redis-cli\n\n```bash\n./src/redis-cli --tls \\\n    --cert ./tests/tls/redis.crt \\\n    --key ./tests/tls/redis.key \\\n    --cacert ./tests/tls/ca.crt\n```\n\n## Additional Configurations\n\n### For Replication\nOn replica servers, enable TLS for connections to master:\n```\ntls-replication yes\n```\n\n### For Redis Cluster\nEnable TLS for cluster bus and cross-node connections:\n```\ntls-cluster yes\n```\n\n### For Sentinel\nSentinel inherits networking configuration from Redis. Use `tls-replication yes` to enable TLS for Sentinel's port and connections to masters.\n\n## Performance Note\n\n⚠️ TLS adds overhead due to encryption/decryption and integrity checks, which decreases achievable throughput. Starting with Redis 8.0, I/O threading with TLS is supported to help mitigate this.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md > TLS]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/build-stack/almalinux-rocky-8.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/install-redis-from-source.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "master", "cluster", "replication", "replica", "TLS", "SSL", "encrypt"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/build-stack/almalinux-rocky-8.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/archive/install-redis/install-redis-from-source.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "0c1acbcb-5608-4309-9820-86e50ea6b019", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "572ca61f-88cd-4917-a941-5002a3eaa48a", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about enabling TLS encryption for Redis connections.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_yQ6YuniddMaU7qomi4j37e', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'enable TLS encryption Redis connections SSL', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_qxFkFW2AI1oCcN1tzCnpuI', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'TLS|SSL|encryption|tls-port|tls-cert'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_yQ6YuniddMaU7qomi4j37e', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.9133,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TLS\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"SSL/TLS is supported by Redis starting with version 6 as an optional feature\\\\\\\\nthat needs to be enabled at compile time.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.4549,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"f7af41d8-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"TLS\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Getting Started > Limitations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Additional TLS configuration is available to control the choice of TLS protocol\\\\\\\\nversions, ciphers and cipher suites, etc. Please consult the self documented\\\\\\\\n`redis.conf` for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTLS adds a layer to the communication stack with overheads due to writing/reading to/from an SSL connection, encryption/decryption and integrity checks.

CLIENT 命令系列（客户端调试）\n\n**CLIENT LIST** — 查看所有连接的客户端状态\n```bash\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> CLIENT LIST\n```\n显示信息包括：客户端地址、连接时长、空闲时间、输出缓冲区占用、最后执行的命令等。\n\n**CLIENT KILL** — 关闭指定客户端连接\n```bash\nCLIENT KILL <client-address>\n```\n\n**CLIENT SETNAME / GETNAME** — 设置/获取连接名称，便于在 SLOWLOG 中识别客户端\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md > TCP keepalive]\n\n## 2. Lua 脚本调试工具\n\n**redis-cli --ldb** — 启动 Lua 脚本调试器\n```bash\n./redis-cli --ldb --eval /tmp/script.lua\n```\n\n调试命令：\n- `step` / `s` — 单步执行\n- `continue` / `c` — 运行到下一个断点\n- `breakpoint` / `b` — 设置/查看断点\n- `print` / `p` — 查看变量值\n- `list` / `l` — 显示源代码\n- `redis.debug()` — 在脚本中输出调试信息\n- `redis.breakpoint()` — 在脚本中设置断点\n\n**redis-cli --ldb-sync-mode** — 同步调试模式（会阻塞服务器）\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md > Synchronous mode, Quick start]\n\n## 3. GDB（进程级调试）\n\n用于调试 Redis 崩溃问题：\n- 附加到运行中的进程检查状态\n- 使用 core 文件分析崩溃时的内存状态\n\n编译无优化版本便于调试：\n```bash\nmake noopt\n```\n\n[来源:

Let\\'s look at what some of the data returned represents:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **addr**: The client address, that is, the client IP and the remote port number it used to connect with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n* **fd**: The client socket file descriptor number.\\\\\\\\n* **name**: The client name as set by [`CLIENT SETNAME`]().\\\\\\\\n* **age**: The number of seconds the connection existed for.\\\\\\\\n* **idle**: The number of seconds the connection is idle.\\\\\\\\n* **flags**: The kind of client (N means normal client, check the [full list of flags]()).\\\\\\\\n* **omem**: The amount of memory used by the client for the output buffer.\\\\\\\\n* **cmd**: The last executed command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [[`CLIENT LIST`]()](/commands/client-list) documentation for the full listing of fields and their purpose.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you have the list of clients, you can close a client\\'s connection using the [`CLIENT KILL`]() command, specifying the client address as its argument.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe commands [`CLIENT SETNAME`]() and [`CLIENT GETNAME`]() can be used to set and get the connection name. Starting with Redis 4.0, the client name is shown in the\\\\\\\\n[`SLOWLOG`]() output, to help identify clients that create latency issues.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom version 3.2 onwards, Redis has TCP keepalive (`SO_KEEPALIVE` socket option) enabled by default and set to about 300 seconds. This option is useful in order to detect dead peers (clients that cannot be reached even if they look connected). Moreover, if there is network equipment between clients and servers that need to see some traffic in order to take the connection open, the option will prevent unexpected connection closed events.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.0794,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"81091cbf\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"81091cbf-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-debugging.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Debugging Lua scripts in Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Synchronous mode\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When the scripts terminates naturally, the debugging session ends and\\\\\\\\n`redis-cli` returns in its normal non-debugging mode. You can restart the\\\\\\\\nsession using the `restart` command as usual.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother way to stop a debugging session is just interrupting `redis-cli`\\\\\\\\nmanually by pressing `Ctrl+C`. Note that also any event breaking the\\\\\\\\nconnection between `redis-cli` and the `redis-server` will interrupt the\\\\\\\\ndebugging session.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll the forked debugging sessions are terminated when the server is shut\\\\\\\\ndown.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDebugging can be a very repetitive task. For this reason every Redis\\\\\\\\ndebugger command starts with a different character, and you can use the single\\\\\\\\ninitial character in order to refer to the command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example instead of typing `step` you can just type `s`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding and removing breakpoints is trivial as described in the online help.\\\\\\\\nJust use `b 1 2 3 4` to add a breakpoint in line 1, 2, 3, 4.\\\\\\\\nThe command `b 0` removes all the breakpoints. Selected breakpoints can be\\\\\\\\nremoved using as argument the line where the breakpoint we want to remove is, but prefixed by a minus sign. \\\\\\\\nSo for example `b -3` removes the breakpoint from line 3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that adding breakpoints to lines that Lua never executes, like declaration of local variables or comments, will not work.\\\\\\\\nThe breakpoint will be added but since this part of the script will never be executed, the program will never stop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the `breakpoint` command it is possible to add breakpoints into specific\\\\\\\\nlines. However sometimes we want to stop the execution of the program only\\\\\\\\nwhen something special happens. In order to do so, you can use the\\\\\\\\n`redis.breakpoint()` function inside your Lua script. When called it simulates\\\\\\\\na breakpoint in the next line that will be executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nif counter > 10 then redis.breakpoint() end\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThis feature is extremely useful when debugging, so that we can avoid\\\\\\\\ncontinuing the script execution manually multiple times until a given condition\\\\\\\\nis encountered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs explained previously, but default LDB uses forked sessions with rollback\\\\\\\\nof all the data changes operated by the script while it has being debugged.\\\\\\\\nDeterminism is usually a good thing to have during debugging, so that successive\\\\\\\\ndebugging sessions can be started without having to reset the database content\\\\\\\\nto its original state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever for tracking certain bugs, you may want to retain the changes performed\\\\\\\\nto the key space by each debugging session.

While `redis-cli` is the default debug client, any client can be used for debugging as long as it meets one of the following conditions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The client provides a native interface for setting the debug mode and controlling the debug session.\\\\\\\\n2. The client provides an interface for sending arbitrary commands over RESP.\\\\\\\\n3. The client allows sending raw messages to the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, the [Redis plugin](https://redis.com/blog/zerobrane-studio-plugin-for-redis-lua-scripts) for [ZeroBrane Studio](http://studio.zerobrane.com/) integrates with LDB using [redis-lua](https://github.com/nrk/redis-lua).

We do our best with\\\\\\\\nevery release to make sure you\\'ll experience a stable product with no\\\\\\\\ncrashes. However, if you ever need to debug the Redis process itself, read on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis crashes, it produces a detailed report of what happened. However,\\\\\\\\nsometimes looking at the crash report is not enough, nor is it possible for\\\\\\\\nthe Redis core team to reproduce the issue independently. In this scenario, we\\\\\\\\nneed help from the user who can reproduce the issue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis guide shows how to use GDB to provide the information the\\\\\\\\nRedis developers will need to track the bug more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGDB is the Gnu Debugger: a program that is able to inspect the internal state\\\\\\\\nof another program. Usually tracking and fixing a bug is an exercise in\\\\\\\\ngathering more information about the state of the program at the moment the\\\\\\\\nbug happens, so GDB is an extremely useful tool.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGDB can be used in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It can attach to a running program and inspect the state of it at runtime.\\\\\\\\n* It can inspect the state of a program that already terminated using what is called a *core file*, that is, the image of the memory at the time the program was running.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of investigating Redis bugs we need to use both of these\\\\\\\\nGDB modes. The user able to reproduce the bug attaches GDB to their running Redis\\\\\\\\ninstance, and when the crash happens, they create the `core` file that in turn\\\\\\\\nthe developer will use to inspect the Redis internals at the time of the crash.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis way the developer can perform all the inspections in his or her computer\\\\\\\\nwithout the help of the user, and the user is free to restart Redis in their\\\\\\\\nproduction environment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default Redis is compiled with the `-O2` switch, this means that compiler\\\\\\\\noptimizations are enabled. This makes the Redis executable faster, but at the\\\\\\\\nsame time it makes Redis (like any other program) harder to inspect using GDB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is better to attach GDB to Redis compiled without optimizations using the\\\\\\\\n`make noopt` command (instead of just using the plain `make` command). However,\\\\\\\\nif you have an already running Redis in production there is no need to recompile\\\\\\\\nand restart it if this is going to create problems on your side. GDB still works\\\\\\\\nagainst executables compiled with optimizations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should not be overly concerned at the loss of performance from compiling Redis\\\\\\\\nwithout optimizations. It is unlikely that this will cause problems in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment as Redis is not very CPU-bound.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.2289,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1d4c65d2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1d4c65d2-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/troubleshooting.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Troubleshooting Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"List of known Linux related bugs affecting Redis.\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This page tries to help you with what to do if you have issues with Redis.

Start a debugging session with:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-cli --ldb --eval /tmp/script.lua\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that with the `--eval` option of `redis-cli` you can pass key names and arguments to the script, separated by a comma, like in the following example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n./redis-cli --ldb --eval /tmp/script.lua mykey somekey , arg1 arg2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll enter a special mode where `redis-cli` no longer accepts its normal\\\\\\\\ncommands, but instead prints a help screen and passes the unmodified debugging\\\\\\\\ncommands directly to Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe only commands which are not passed to the Redis debugger are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `quit` -- this will terminate the debugging session.\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s like removing all the breakpoints and using the `continue` debugging command.\\\\\\\\nMoreover the command will exit from `redis-cli`.\\\\\\\\n* `restart` -- the debugging session will restart from scratch, **reloading the new version of the script from the file**.\\\\\\\\nSo a normal debugging cycle involves modifying the script after some debugging, and calling `restart` in order to start debugging again with the new script changes.\\\\\\\\n* `help` -- this command is passed to the Redis Lua debugger, that will print a list of commands like the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nlua debugger> help\\\\\\\\nRedis Lua debugger help:\\\\\\\\n[h]elp               Show this help.\\\\\\\\n[s]tep               Run current line and stop again.\\\\\\\\n[n]ext               Alias for step.\\\\\\\\n[c]ontinue           Run till next breakpoint.\\\\\\\\n[l]ist               List source code around current line.\\\\\\\\n[l]ist [line]        List source code around [line].\\\\\\\\n                     line = 0 means: current position.\\\\\\\\n[l]ist [line] [ctx]  In this form [ctx] specifies how many lines\\\\\\\\n                     to show before/after [line].\\\\\\\\n[w]hole              List all source code.

In sync\\\\\\\\n                     mode dataset changes will be retained.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDebugger functions you can call from Lua scripts:\\\\\\\\nredis.debug()        Produce logs in the debugger console.\\\\\\\\nredis.breakpoint()   Stop execution as if there was a breakpoint in the\\\\\\\\n                     next line of code.\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that when you start the debugger it will start in **stepping mode**.\\\\\\\\nIt will stop at the first line of the script that actually does something before executing it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom this point you usually call `step` in order to execute the line and go to the next line.\\\\\\\\nWhile you step Redis will show all the commands executed by the server like in the following example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n* Stopped at 1, stop reason = step over\\\\\\\\n-> 1   redis.call(\\'ping\\')\\\\\\\\nlua debugger> step\\\\\\\\n<redis> ping\\\\\\\\n<reply> \\\\\\\\\\\\\"+PONG\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n* Stopped at 2, stop reason = step over\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `<redis>` and `<reply>` lines show the command executed by the line just\\\\\\\\nexecuted, and the reply from the server. Note that this happens only in stepping mode.\\\\\\\\nIf you use `continue` in order to execute the script till the next breakpoint, commands will not be dumped on the screen to prevent too much output.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.5963,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1c57d308\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1c57d308-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/Debugging.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Debugging\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"There are two methods you can use to debug your Redis Stack functions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

Clients using replicas for read scaling will automatically reconnect to other available replicas.\n\n### For Master Nodes (Zero-Downtime Procedure)\n\n1. **Trigger manual failover** - Use `CLUSTER FAILOVER` to promote one of the master's replicas to become the new master\n2. **Wait for role change** - The old master automatically becomes a replica\n3. **Upgrade the node** - Stop and upgrade this node (now a replica) with the new Redis version\n4. **Optional: Restore master role** - Trigger another manual failover to promote the upgraded node back to master\n\n### Before Starting\n\n- **Practice in non-production** - Test the upgrade process in a controlled environment (Docker recommended)\n- **Create snapshots** on each node:\n  ```bash\n  redis-cli -p <port> SAVE\n  ```\n- **Backup data directories** - Identify and copy data directories:\n  ```bash\n  redis-cli -p <port> CONFIG GET dir\n  ```\n\n### Verification\n\nAfter upgrading each node, verify:\n```bash\nredis-cli -p <port> INFO server | grep redis_version\nredis-cli -p <port> cluster info\nredis-cli --cluster check <IP address>:<port>\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- **Redis Query Engine** won't be fully operational until all master shards complete their upgrades.

This guide assumes you have installed Redis using one of the supported methods listed [here]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore upgrading, create a snapshot of your current dataset on each node (identified by its port) using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> SAVE\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRepeat for every node in your cluster, both masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis creates or updates an `RDB` file, for example `dump.rdb`, in the node\\'s Redis data directory. If you use AOF persistence, the files will be named `appendonly.aof.*` and they will be written in the `appendonlydir` directory inside the data directory. The AOF-related directory and file names are the defaults. Use the names defined in your `redis.conf` file if different from the defaults.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the following command on each node to identify where your data directories are located:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> CONFIG GET dir\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake a copy of the files contained in each of those directories before proceeding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpgrade each node one at a time, starting with the replicas, using these steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

However while net-splits are likely to isolate a number of nodes\\\\\\\\nat the same time, many other kind of failures, like hardware or software failures\\\\\\\\nlocal to a single node, are a very notable class of failures that are unlikely\\\\\\\\nto happen at the same time, so it is possible that in your cluster where\\\\\\\\nevery master has a replica, the replica is killed at 4am, and the master is killed\\\\\\\\nat 6am. This still will result in a cluster that can no longer operate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo improve reliability of the system we have the option to add additional\\\\\\\\nreplicas to every master, but this is expensive. Replica migration allows to\\\\\\\\nadd more replicas to just a few masters. So you have 10 masters with 1 replica\\\\\\\\neach, for a total of 20 instances. However you add, for example, 3 instances\\\\\\\\nmore as replicas of some of your masters, so certain masters will have more\\\\\\\\nthan a single replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith replicas migration what happens is that if a master is left without\\\\\\\\nreplicas, a replica from a master that has multiple replicas will migrate to\\\\\\\\nthe *orphaned* master. So after your replica goes down at 4am as in the example\\\\\\\\nwe made above, another replica will take its place, and when the master\\\\\\\\nwill fail as well at 5am, there is still a replica that can be elected so that\\\\\\\\nthe cluster can continue to operate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo what you should know about replicas migration in short?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The cluster will try to migrate a replica from the master that has the greatest number of replicas in a given moment.\\\\\\\\n* To benefit from replica migration you have just to add a few more replicas to a single master in your cluster, it does not matter what master.\\\\\\\\n* There is a configuration parameter that controls the replica migration feature that is called `cluster-migration-barrier`: you can read more about it in the example `redis.conf` file provided with Redis Cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.7408,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-018\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Upgrade nodes in a Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Upgrading replica nodes is easy since you just need to stop the node and restart\\\\\\\\nit with an updated version of Redis.

When received, Redis doesn't exit immediately but schedules a shutdown similar to the `SHUTDOWN` command. The process starts as soon as the current command completes (with a possible delay of ≤0.1 seconds).\n\n**Graceful shutdown steps:**\n1. **Replica synchronization** (Redis 7.0+): If replicas are lagging, Redis pauses write clients and waits up to `shutdown-timeout` (default 10 seconds) for replicas to catch up\n2. **Kill background processes**: Any RDB save or AOF rewrite child processes are terminated\n3. **Flush AOF**: If AOF is active, calls `fsync` to flush buffers to disk\n4. **Synchronous RDB save**: If configured for RDB persistence, performs a blocking save (doesn't use extra memory)\n5. **Cleanup**: Removes PID file (if daemonized) and Unix socket (if enabled)\n6. **Exit**: Server exits with code 0\n\n**Important notes:**\n- If RDB save fails, shutdown is aborted to prevent data loss\n- If blocked by a long Lua script, use `SCRIPT KILL` first\n- Before Redis 7.0, shutting down a diskless master could cause data loss. Consider using `FAILOVER` to demote the master first\n\n### Crash Signals\nThese are handled as crashes: **SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL**\n\nWhen trapped, Redis:\n- Logs a bug report (stack trace, registers, client state)\n- Runs a fast memory test (Redis 2.8+)\n- Removes PID file\n- Re-sends the signal to itself for default action (e.g., core dump)\n\n### SIGUSR1 (Kill RDB Child Without Error)\nSince Redis 2.6.10, this signal kills the RDB-saving child process without triggering an error condition, allowing the server to continue accepting writes.\n\n[Source: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md > SIGTERM and SIGINT]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.6-release-notes.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["failover", "master", "RDB", "AOF", "replica", "memory", "MEMORY", "signal", "SIGTERM", "shutdown", "Lua", "script"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.6-release-notes.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "7485580c-c850-475b-99c8-7d1885f0fb2a", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "520b7aef-2105-4ad7-a9c1-f6a5451d2442", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Redis signal handling and graceful shutdown.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_RjUGcBEjwPHvKdaehbL992', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'signal|SIGTERM|SIGINT|shutdown'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_UfnlHA8uSh3cIspIScLkYS', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis signal handling graceful shutdown SIGTERM SIGINT', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_RjUGcBEjwPHvKdaehbL992', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_UfnlHA8uSh3cIspIScLkYS', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.5927,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis signal handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"SIGTERM and SIGINT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This document provides information about how Redis reacts to different POSIX signals such as `SIGTERM` and `SIGSEGV`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe information in this document **only applies to Redis version 2.6 or greater**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals tell Redis to shut down gracefully.

Since the save is synchronous, it doesn\\'t use any additional memory.\\\\\\\\n* If the server is daemonized, the PID file is removed.\\\\\\\\n* If the Unix domain socket is enabled, it gets removed.\\\\\\\\n* The server exits with an exit code of zero.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIF the RDB file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails, and the server continues to run in order to ensure no data loss.\\\\\\\\nLikewise, if the user just turned on AOF, and the server triggered the first AOF rewrite in order to create the initial AOF file but this file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails and the server continues to run.\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.6.11, no further attempt to shut down will be made unless a new `SIGTERM` is received or the [`SHUTDOWN`](/commands/shutdown) command is issued.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 7.0, the server waits for lagging replicas up to a configurable `shutdown-timeout`, 10 seconds by default, before shutting down.\\\\\\\\nThis provides a best effort to minimize the risk of data loss in a situation where no save points are configured and AOF is deactivated.\\\\\\\\nBefore version 7.0, shutting down a heavily loaded master node in a diskless setup was more likely to result in data loss.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risk of data loss in such setups, trigger a manual [`FAILOVER`](/commands/failover) (or [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)) to demote the master to a replica and promote one of the replicas to a new master before shutting down a master node.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.7774,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis signal handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Kill the RDB file without errors\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The following signals are handled as a Redis crash:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* SIGSEGV\\\\\\\\n* SIGBUS\\\\\\\\n* SIGFPE\\\\\\\\n* SIGILL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce one of these signals is trapped, Redis stops any current operation and performs the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Adds a bug report to the log file.

Another is called *Objectively Down*\\\\\\\\ncondition (ODOWN) and is reached when enough Sentinels (at least the\\\\\\\\nnumber configured as the `quorum` parameter of the monitored master) have\\\\\\\\nan SDOWN condition, and get feedback from other Sentinels using\\\\\\\\nthe `SENTINEL is-master-down-by-addr` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of a Sentinel an SDOWN condition is reached when it\\\\\\\\ndoes not receive a valid reply to PING requests for the number of seconds\\\\\\\\nspecified in the configuration as `is-master-down-after-milliseconds`\\\\\\\\nparameter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn acceptable reply to PING is one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with +PONG.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -LOADING error.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -MASTERDOWN error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAny other reply (or no reply at all) is considered non valid.\\\\\\\\nHowever note that **a logical master that advertises itself as a replica in\\\\\\\\nthe INFO output is considered to be down**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that SDOWN requires that no acceptable reply is received for the whole\\\\\\\\ninterval configured, so for instance if the interval is 30000 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n(30 seconds) and we receive an acceptable ping reply every 29 seconds, the\\\\\\\\ninstance is considered to be working.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSDOWN is not enough to trigger a failover: it only means a single Sentinel\\\\\\\\nbelieves a Redis instance is not available. To trigger a failover, the\\\\\\\\nODOWN state must be reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo switch from SDOWN to ODOWN no strong consensus algorithm is used, but\\\\\\\\njust a form of gossip: if a given Sentinel gets reports that a master\\\\\\\\nis not working from enough Sentinels **in a given time range**, the SDOWN is\\\\\\\\npromoted to ODOWN. If this acknowledge is later missing, the flag is cleared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA more strict authorization that uses an actual majority is required in\\\\\\\\norder to really start the failover, but no failover can be triggered without\\\\\\\\nreaching the ODOWN state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ODOWN condition **only applies to masters**. For other kind of instances\\\\\\\\nSentinel doesn\\'t require to act, so the ODOWN state is never reached for replicas\\\\\\\\nand other sentinels, but only SDOWN is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever SDOWN has also semantic implications. For example a replica in SDOWN\\\\\\\\nstate is not selected to be promoted by a Sentinel performing a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels and replicas auto discovery\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels stay connected with other Sentinels in order to reciprocally\\\\\\\\ncheck the availability of each other, and to exchange messages. However you\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t need to configure a list of other Sentinel addresses in every Sentinel\\\\\\\\ninstance you run, as Sentinel uses the Redis instances Pub/Sub capabilities\\\\\\\\nin order to discover the other Sentinels that are monitoring the same masters\\\\\\\\nand replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is implemented by sending *hello messages* into the channel named\\\\\\\\n`__sentinel__:hello`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly you don\\'t need to configure what is the list of the replicas attached\\\\\\\\nto a master, as Sentinel will auto discover this list querying Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel publishes a message to every monitored master and replica Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello`, every two seconds, announcing its presence with ip, port, runid.\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel is subscribed to the Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello` of every master and replica, looking for unknown sentinels. When new sentinels are detected, they are added as sentinels of this master.\\\\\\\\n* Hello messages also include the full current configuration of the master. If the receiving Sentinel has a configuration for a given master which is older than the one received, it updates to the new configuration immediately.\\\\\\\\n* Before adding a new sentinel to a master a Sentinel always checks if there is already a sentinel with the same runid or the same address (ip and port pair). In that case all the matching sentinels are removed, and the new added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel reconfiguration of instances outside the failover procedure\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven when no failover is in progress, Sentinels will always try to set the\\\\\\\\ncurrent configuration on monitored instances. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Replicas (according to the current configuration) that claim to be masters, will be configured as replicas to replicate with the current master.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas connected to a wrong master, will be reconfigured to replicate with the right master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinels to reconfigure replicas, the wrong configuration must be observed for some time, that is greater than the period used to broadcast new configurations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis prevents Sentinels with a stale configuration (for example because they just rejoined from a partition) will try to change the replicas configuration before receiving an update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note how the semantics of always trying to impose the current configuration makes the failover more resistant to partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Masters failed over are reconfigured as replicas when they return available.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas partitioned away during a partition are reconfigured once reachable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe important lesson to remember about this section is: **Sentinel is a system where each process will always try to impose the last logical configuration to the set of monitored instances**.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.675,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis client handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Query Buffer Hard Limit\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis needs to handle a variable-length output buffer for every client, since\\\\\\\\na command can produce a large amount of data that needs to be transferred to the\\\\\\\\nclient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever it is possible that a client sends more commands producing more output\\\\\\\\nto serve at a faster rate than that which Redis can send the existing output to the\\\\\\\\nclient. This is especially true with Pub/Sub clients in case a client is not\\\\\\\\nable to process new messages fast enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth conditions will cause the client output buffer to grow and consume\\\\\\\\nmore and more memory. For this reason by default Redis sets limits to the\\\\\\\\noutput buffer size for different kind of clients. When the limit is reached\\\\\\\\nthe client connection is closed and the event logged in the Redis log file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two kind of limits Redis uses:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The **hard limit** is a fixed limit that when reached will make Redis close the client connection as soon as possible.\\\\\\\\n* The **soft limit** instead is a limit that depends on the time, for instance a soft limit of 32 megabytes per 10 seconds means that if the client has an output buffer bigger than 32 megabytes for, continuously, 10 seconds, the connection gets closed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDifferent kind of clients have different default limits:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Normal clients** have a default limit of 0, that means, no limit at all, because most normal clients use blocking implementations sending a single command and waiting for the reply to be completely read before sending the next command, so it is always not desirable to close the connection in case of a normal client.\\\\\\\\n* **Pub/Sub clients** have a default hard limit of 32 megabytes and a soft limit of 8 megabytes per 60 seconds.\\\\\\\\n* **Replicas** have a default hard limit of 256 megabytes and a soft limit of 64 megabyte per 60 seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to change the limit at runtime using the [`CONFIG SET`]() command or in a permanent way using the Redis configuration file `redis.conf`. See the example `redis.conf` in the Redis distribution for more information about how to set the limit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery client is also subject to a query buffer limit. This is a non-configurable hard limit that will close the connection when the client query buffer (that is the buffer we use to accumulate commands from the client) reaches 1 GB, and is actually only an extreme limit to avoid a server crash in case of client or server software bugs.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.1677,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis client handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"What Order are Client Requests Served In?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This document provides information about how Redis handles clients at the network layer level: connections, timeouts, buffers, and other similar topics are covered here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe information contained in this document is **only applicable to Redis version 2.6 or greater**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis accepts clients connections on the configured TCP port and on the Unix socket if enabled. When a new client connection is accepted the following operations are performed:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client socket is put in the non-blocking state since Redis uses multiplexing and non-blocking I/O.\\\\\\\\n* The `TCP_NODELAY` option is set in order to ensure that there are no delays to the connection.\\\\\\\\n* A *readable* file event is created so that Redis is able to collect the client queries as soon as new data is available to read on the socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the client is initialized, Redis checks if it is already at the limit\\\\\\\\nconfigured for the number of simultaneous clients (configured using the `maxclients` configuration directive, see the next section of this document for further information).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis can\\'t accept a new client connection because the maximum number of clients\\\\\\\\nhas been reached, it tries to send an error to the client in order to\\\\\\\\nmake it aware of this condition, closing the connection immediately.\\\\\\\\nThe error message will reach the client even if the connection is\\\\\\\\nclosed immediately by Redis because the new socket output buffer is usually\\\\\\\\nbig enough to contain the error, so the kernel will handle transmission\\\\\\\\nof the error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe order is determined by a combination of the client socket file descriptor\\\\\\\\nnumber and order in which the kernel reports events, so the order should be \\\\\\\\nconsidered as unspecified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, Redis does the following two things when serving clients:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It only performs a single `read()` system call every time there is something new to read from the client socket. This ensures that if we have multiple clients connected, and a few send queries at a high rate, other clients are not penalized and will not experience latency issues.\\\\\\\\n* However once new data is read from a client, all the queries contained in the current buffers are processed sequentially. This improves locality and does not need iterating a second time to see if there are clients that need some processing time.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.2477,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c5c59021-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis client handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Client Timeouts\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"By default recent versions of Redis don\\'t close the connection with the client\\\\\\\\nif the client is idle for many seconds: the connection will remain open forever.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever if you don\\'t like this behavior, you can configure a timeout, so that\\\\\\\\nif the client is idle for more than the specified number of seconds, the client connection will be closed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can configure this limit via `redis.conf` or simply using `CONFIG SET timeout <value>`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the timeout only applies to normal clients and it **does not apply to Pub/Sub clients**, since a Pub/Sub connection is a *push style* connection so a client that is idle is the norm.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if by default connections are not subject to timeout, there are two conditions when it makes sense to set a timeout:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Mission critical applications where a bug in the client software may saturate the Redis server with idle connections, causing service disruption.\\\\\\\\n* As a debugging mechanism in order to be able to connect with the server if a bug in the client software saturates the server with idle connections, making it impossible to interact with the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTimeouts are not to be considered very precise: Redis avoids setting timer events or running O(N) algorithms in order to check idle clients, so the check is performed incrementally from time to time.

Pipelining is supported by most Redis clients. This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.6657,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Appendix: Why are busy loops slow even on the loopback interface?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In the following benchmark we\\'ll use the Redis Ruby client, supporting pipelining, to test the speed improvement due to pipelining:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```ruby\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'rubygems\\'\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'redis\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef bench(descr)\\\\\\\\n  start = Time.now\\\\\\\\n  yield\\\\\\\\n  puts \\\\\\\\\\\\\"#{descr} #{Time.now -

So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8042,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"fc275d19\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"fc275d19-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/benchmarks/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis benchmark\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Other Redis benchmarking tools\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"It is critically important that Redis performance is retained or improved seamlessly on every released version. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo assess it, we\\'ve conducted benchmarks on the released versions of Redis (starting on v2.6.0) using `redis-benchmark` on a series of command types over a standalone redis-server, repeating the same benchmark multiple times, ensuring its statistical significance, and measuring the run-to-run variance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe used hardware platform was a stable bare-metal HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 Server, with one Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6230 CPU @ 2.10GHz, disabling Intel HT Technology, disabling CPU Frequency scaling, with all configurable BIOS and CPU system settings set to performance. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe box was running Ubuntu 18.04 Linux release 4.15.0-123, and Redis was compiled with gcc 7.5.0.\\\\\\\\nThe used benchmark client (`redis-benchmark`) was kept stable across all tests, with version `redis-benchmark 6.2.0 (git:445aa844)`.\\\\\\\\nBoth the redis-server and redis-benchmark processes were pinned to specific physical cores.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following benchmark options were used across tests:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The tests were done with 50 simultaneous clients performing 5 million requests.\\\\\\\\n* Tests were executed using the loopback interface.\\\\\\\\n* Tests were executed without pipelining.\\\\\\\\n* The used payload size was 256 Bytes.\\\\\\\\n* For each redis-benchmark process, 2 threads were used to ensure that the benchmark client was not the bottleneck.\\\\\\\\n* Strings, Hashes, Sets, and Sorted Sets data types were benchmarked.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow we present the obtained results, broken by data type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Strings performance over versions](./performance-strings.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Hashes performance over versions](./performance-hashes.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Sets performance over versions](./performance-sets.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Sorted sets performance over versions](./performance-sorted-sets.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are several third-party tools that can be used for benchmarking Redis.

No other client's request can interrupt the transaction execution.\n\n**All-or-nothing on connection loss**: If the client loses connection before calling `EXEC`, none of the operations are performed. If `EXEC` is called, all operations are performed.\n\n## Error handling\n\n- **Syntax errors** (before EXEC): Detected during command queuing. Redis refuses to execute the transaction and returns an error during `EXEC`.\n- **Runtime errors** (after EXEC): Redis does NOT stop processing. Even if one command fails, all other commands in the queue are still executed. **No rollback support**.\n\n## Aborting transactions\n\nUse `DISCARD` to abort a transaction and flush the command queue:\n\n```redis\n> MULTI\nOK\n> INCR foo\nQUEUED\n> DISCARD\nOK\n```\n\n## Optimistic locking with WATCH\n\n`WATCH` provides check-and-set (CAS) behavior. If a watched key is modified before `EXEC`, the entire transaction aborts:\n\n```redis\nWATCH mykey\nval = GET mykey\nval = val + 1\nMULTI\nSET mykey $val\nEXEC\n```\n\nIf another client modifies `mykey` between `WATCH` and `EXEC`, the transaction fails and returns a Null reply.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md > Usage, Discarding the command queue, Optimistic locking using check-and-set]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md", "docs/design.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/multi-key-operations.md", "docs/dual-repo-architecture.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["MULTI", "EXEC", "transaction"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md", "docs/design.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/multi-key-operations.md", "docs/dual-repo-architecture.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "2e0f02bc-0977-4a9e-8a6c-027c66ebd481", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "7d0a61d2-9969-40a5-b230-3625ab580204", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis transactions and MULTI/EXEC commands.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_1KXfy6mLtJ7nW5pqZ29TT9', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis transactions MULTI EXEC', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_ZVsOsKvOdHObxxz9Mt4Ncn', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'MULTI|EXEC'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_1KXfy6mLtJ7nW5pqZ29TT9', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.4467,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Transactions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Usage\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Transactions allow the execution of a group of commands\\\\\\\\nin a single step, they are centered around the commands \\\\\\\\n[`MULTI`](), [`EXEC`](), [`DISCARD`]() and [`WATCH`]().\\\\\\\\nRedis Transactions make two important guarantees:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* All the commands in a transaction are serialized and executed\\\\\\\\nsequentially.

Default Mode (Memory-based tracking)**\n- Server remembers which keys each client accessed\n- Sends invalidation messages only for keys the client might have cached\n- Costs memory on server side but is more efficient with invalidation messages\n\n**2. Broadcasting Mode**\n- Server doesn't track individual client access\n- Zero memory cost on server side\n- Clients subscribe to key prefixes (e.g., `object:`, `user:`)\n- Receives notifications for all keys matching subscribed prefixes\n\n## How Tracking Works\n\n1. **Enable tracking**: `CLIENT TRACKING ON`\n2. **Server tracks reads**: When client requests keys (e.g., `GET foo`), server remembers this\n3. **Invalidation on modification**: When a key is modified, evicted, or expires, server sends invalidation messages to all tracking clients\n4. **Client evicts cache**: Clients must remove invalidated keys to avoid serving stale data\n\n**Example protocol flow:**\n```\nClient 1 -> Server: CLIENT TRACKING ON\nClient 1 -> Server: GET foo\n(Server remembers Client 1 may have \"foo\" cached)\nClient 2 -> Server: SET foo SomeOtherValue\nServer -> Client 1: INVALIDATE \"foo\"\n```\n\n## Key Implementation Details\n\n**Invalidation Table**: Server uses a global table with maximum entries. When full, it evicts old entries by sending fake invalidation messages to reclaim memory.\n\n**Client IDs**: Uses numerical IDs instead of pointers for efficient garbage collection when clients disconnect.\n\n**Single namespace**: Ignores database numbers - invalidation for `foo` in DB 2 triggers for `foo` in DB 3 as well.\n\n## Connection Models\n\n**RESP3 (Redis 6+)**: Single connection for both data queries and invalidation messages\n\n**RESP2 (Two-connection mode)**: \n- One connection for data queries\n- One connection for invalidation messages via Pub/Sub (`__redis__:invalidate` channel)\n- Use `CLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT <client-id>` to redirect invalidations\n\n## Broadcasting Mode Usage\n\n```\nCLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 10 BCAST PREFIX object: PREFIX user:\n```\n- Subscribe to specific prefixes\n- Empty prefix = receive invalidations for all keys\n- Prefixes cannot overlap (e.g., can't have both \"foo\" and \"foob\")\n\n## NOLOOP Option\n\nPrevents clients from receiving invalidation messages for keys they just modified - useful when clients cache their own writes locally.\n\n## Race Condition Handling\n\nWhen using two connections, invalidation messages may arrive before GET responses. Solution:\n1. Set placeholder value when sending GET\n2. If invalidation arrives, delete from cache\n3. Don't cache the response if entry is missing\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md > The Redis implementation of client-side caching, Two connections mode, The NOLOOP option, Other hints for implementing client libraries]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["user", "memory", "OBJECT", "MEMORY", "client-side", "caching", "invalidat"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "fb73701a-820a-45fe-b323-ad6d578db974", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "cf679510-50d9-4c2b-8fde-557606ec445a", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis client-side caching mechanism and invalidation using both keyword search and semantic search.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_MP6cBr9qmZkDkSMrfgqKa4', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'client-side caching|client caching|invalidation'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_5K6rcZZuYdI9wGeZ2cwKxO', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis client-side caching mechanism invalidation tracking', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_MP6cBr9qmZkDkSMrfgqKa4', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_5K6rcZZuYdI9wGeZ2cwKxO', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 6.1017,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis implementation of client-side caching\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis client-side caching support is called _Tracking_, and has two modes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* In the default mode, the server remembers what keys a given client accessed, and sends invalidation messages when the same keys are modified. This costs memory in the server side, but sends invalidation messages only for the set of keys that the client might have in memory.\\\\\\\\n* In the _broadcasting_ mode, the server does not attempt to remember what keys a given client accessed, so this mode costs no memory at all in the server side. Instead clients subscribe to key prefixes such as `object:` or `user:`, and receive a notification message every time a key matching a subscribed prefix is touched.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo recap, for now let\\'s forget for a moment about the broadcasting mode, to\\\\\\\\nfocus on the first mode. We\\'ll describe broadcasting in more detail later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Clients can enable tracking if they want. Connections start without tracking enabled.\\\\\\\\n2. When tracking is enabled, the server remembers what keys each client requested during the connection lifetime (by sending read commands about such keys).\\\\\\\\n3. When a key is modified by some client, or is evicted because it has an associated expire time, or evicted because of a _maxmemory_ policy, all the clients with tracking enabled that may have the key cached, are notified with an _invalidation message_.\\\\\\\\n4. When clients receive invalidation messages, they are required to remove the corresponding keys, in order to avoid serving stale data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of the protocol:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: CLIENT TRACKING ON\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: GET foo\\\\\\\\n* (The server remembers that Client 1 may have the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" cached)\\\\\\\\n* (Client 1 may remember the value of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" inside its local memory)\\\\\\\\n* Client 2 `->` Server: SET foo SomeOtherValue\\\\\\\\n* Server `->` Client 1: INVALIDATE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis looks great superficially, but if you imagine 10k connected clients all\\\\\\\\nasking for millions of keys over long living connection, the server ends up\\\\\\\\nstoring too much information. For this reason Redis uses two key ideas in\\\\\\\\norder to limit the amount of memory used server-side and the CPU cost of\\\\\\\\nhandling the data structures implementing the feature:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The server remembers the list of clients that may have cached a given key in a single global table. This table is called the **Invalidation Table**. The invalidation table can contain a maximum number of entries. If a new key is inserted, the server may evict an older entry by pretending that such key was modified (even if it was not), and sending an invalidation message to the clients. Doing so, it can reclaim the memory used for this key, even if this will force the clients having a local copy of the key to evict it.\\\\\\\\n* Inside the invalidation table we don\\'t really need to store pointers to clients\\' structures, that would force a garbage collection procedure when the client disconnects: instead what we do is just store client IDs (each Redis client has a unique numerical ID). If a client disconnects, the information will be incrementally garbage collected as caching slots are invalidated.\\\\\\\\n* There is a single keys namespace, not divided by database numbers. So if a client is caching the key `foo` in database 2, and some other client changes the value of the key `foo` in database 3, an invalidation message will still be sent. This way we can ignore database numbers reducing both the memory usage and the implementation complexity.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.1171,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"The NOLOOP option\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"So far we described the first client-side caching model that Redis implements.\\\\\\\\nThere is another one, called broadcasting, that sees the problem from the\\\\\\\\npoint of view of a different tradeoff, does not consume any memory on the\\\\\\\\nserver side, but instead sends more invalidation messages to clients.\\\\\\\\nIn this mode we have the following main behaviors:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients enable client-side caching using the `BCAST` option, specifying one or more prefixes using the `PREFIX` option. For instance: `CLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 10 BCAST PREFIX object: PREFIX user:`. If no prefix is specified at all, the prefix is assumed to be the empty string, so the client will receive invalidation messages for every key that gets modified. Instead if one or more prefixes are used, only keys matching one of the specified prefixes will be sent in the invalidation messages.\\\\\\\\n* The server does not store anything in the invalidation table. Instead it uses a different **Prefixes Table**, where each prefix is associated to a list of clients.\\\\\\\\n* No two prefixes can track overlapping parts of the keyspace. For instance, having the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foob\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would not be allowed, since they would both trigger an invalidation for the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foobar\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, just using the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is sufficient.\\\\\\\\n* Every time a key matching any of the prefixes is modified, all the clients subscribed to that prefix, will receive the invalidation message.\\\\\\\\n* The server will consume CPU proportional to the number of registered prefixes. If you have just a few, it is hard to see any difference. With a big number of prefixes the CPU cost can become quite large.\\\\\\\\n* In this mode the server can perform the optimization of creating a single reply for all the clients subscribed to a given prefix, and send the same reply to all. This helps to lower the CPU usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default client-side tracking will send invalidation messages to the\\\\\\\\nclient that modified the key. Sometimes clients want this, since they\\\\\\\\nimplement very basic logic that does not involve automatically caching\\\\\\\\nwrites locally. However, more advanced clients may want to cache even the\\\\\\\\nwrites they are doing in the local in-memory table. In such case receiving\\\\\\\\nan invalidation message immediately after the write is a problem, since it\\\\\\\\nwill force the client to evict the value it just cached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this case it is possible to use the `NOLOOP` option: it works both\\\\\\\\nin normal and broadcasting mode. Using this option, clients are able to\\\\\\\\ntell the server they don\\'t want to receive invalidation messages for keys\\\\\\\\nthat they modified.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7535,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Two connections mode\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Using the new version of the Redis protocol, RESP3, supported by Redis 6, it is possible to run the data queries and receive the invalidation messages in the same connection. However many client implementations may prefer to implement client-side caching using two separated connections: one for data, and one for invalidation messages. For this reason when a client enables tracking, it can specify to redirect the invalidation messages to another connection by specifying the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"client ID\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of a different connection. Many data connections can redirect invalidation messages to the same connection, this is useful for clients implementing connection pooling. The two connections model is the only one that is also supported for RESP2 (which lacks the ability to multiplex different kind of information in the same connection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of a complete session using the Redis protocol in the old RESP2 mode involving the following steps: enabling tracking redirecting to another connection, asking for a key, and getting an invalidation message once the key gets modified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo start, the client opens a first connection that will be used for invalidations, requests the connection ID, and subscribes via Pub/Sub to the special channel that is used to get invalidation messages when in RESP2 modes (remember that RESP2 is the usual Redis protocol, and not the more advanced protocol that you can use, optionally, with Redis 6 using the [`HELLO`]() command):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT ID\\\\\\\\n:4\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE __redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$9\\\\\\\\nsubscribe\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow we can enable tracking from the data connection:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 2 -- data connection)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 4\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGET foo\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nbar\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client may decide to cache `\\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" => \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` in the local memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA different client will now modify the value of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" key:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Some other unrelated connection)\\\\\\\\nSET foo bar\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result, the invalidations connection will receive a message that invalidates the specified key.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$7\\\\\\\\nmessage\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*1\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nfoo\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe client will check if there are cached keys in this caching slot, and will evict the information that is no longer valid.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the third element of the Pub/Sub message is not a single key but\\\\\\\\nis a Redis array with just a single element. Since we send an array, if there\\\\\\\\nare groups of keys to invalidate, we can do that in a single message.\\\\\\\\nIn case of a flush ([`FLUSHALL`]() or [`FLUSHDB`]()), a `null` message will be sent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA very important thing to understand about client-side caching used with\\\\\\\\nRESP2 and a Pub/Sub connection in order to read the invalidation messages,\\\\\\\\nis that using Pub/Sub is entirely a trick **in order to reuse old client\\\\\\\\nimplementations**, but actually the message is not really sent to a channel\\\\\\\\nand received by all the clients subscribed to it.

To avoid this problem, it is a good idea to populate the cache\\\\\\\\nwhen we send the command with a placeholder:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: set the local copy of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"caching-in-progress\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    [D] client-> server: GET foo.\\\\\\\\n    [I] server -> client: Invalidate foo (somebody else touched it)\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: delete \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the local cache.\\\\\\\\n    [D] server -> client: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the reply of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"GET foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n    Client cache: don\\'t set \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\" since the entry for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is missing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSuch a race condition is not possible when using a single connection for both\\\\\\\\ndata and invalidation messages, since the order of the messages is always known\\\\\\\\nin that case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, if we lost the connection with the socket we use in order to\\\\\\\\nget the invalidation messages, we may end with stale data. In order to avoid\\\\\\\\nthis problem, we need to do the following things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure that if the connection is lost, the local cache is flushed.\\\\\\\\n2. Both when using RESP2 with Pub/Sub, or RESP3, ping the invalidation channel periodically (you can send PING commands even when the connection is in Pub/Sub mode!). If the connection looks broken and we are not able to receive ping backs, after a maximum amount of time, close the connection and flush the cache.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients may want to run internal statistics about the number of times\\\\\\\\na given cached key was actually served in a request, to understand in the\\\\\\\\nfuture what is good to cache. In general:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that change continuously.\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that are requested very rarely.\\\\\\\\n* We want to cache keys that are requested often and change at a reasonable rate. For an example of key not changing at a reasonable rate, think of a global counter that is continuously [`INCR`]()emented.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever simpler clients may just evict data using some random sampling just\\\\\\\\nremembering the last time a given cached value was served, trying to evict\\\\\\\\nkeys that were not served recently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Handling TTLs: make sure you also request the key TTL and set the TTL in the local cache if you want to support caching keys with a TTL.\\\\\\\\n* Putting a max TTL on every key is a good idea, even if it has no TTL. This protects against bugs or connection issues that would make the client have old data in the local copy.\\\\\\\\n* Limiting the amount of memory used by clients is absolutely needed. There must be a way to evict old keys when new ones are added.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Redis implements client-side caching through a feature called **Tracking**, which allows clients to cache data locally and receive invalidation messages when cached keys are modified.\\n\\n## Two Operating Modes\\n\\n**1.

Syntax\n\nThe `EVAL` command takes two main arguments:\n\n```\nEVAL \"script\" numkeys [key ...] [arg ...]\n```\n\n- **First argument**: The Lua script source code as a string\n- **Second argument**: The number of Redis key names that follow (0 if no keys)\n- **Following arguments**: Key names (KEYS) and additional arguments (ARGV)\n\n## Simple Example\n\n```\n> EVAL \"return 'Hello, scripting!'\" 0\n\"Hello, scripting!\"\n```\n\nThis executes a simple script with no keys or arguments (numkeys = 0).\n\n## Accessing Redis Commands\n\nUse `redis.call()` or `redis.pcall()` to execute Redis commands from within your script:\n\n```\n> EVAL \"return redis.call('SET', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\" 1 foo bar\nOK\n```\n\nThis script:\n- Takes 1 key name (`KEYS[1]` = \"foo\")\n- Takes 1 argument (`ARGV[1]` = \"bar\")\n- Executes `SET foo bar`\n\n**Difference between `redis.call()` and `redis.pcall()`:**\n- `redis.call()`: Errors are returned directly to the client\n- `redis.pcall()`: Errors are returned to the script for handling\n\n## Script Caching\n\nTo avoid sending the full script repeatedly, use `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVALSHA`:\n\n```\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \"return 'Immabe a cached script'\"\n\"c664a3bf70bd1d45c4284ffebb65a6f2299bfc9f\"\n\nredis> EVALSHA c664a3bf70bd1d45c4284ffebb65a6f2299bfc9f 0\n\"Immabe a cached script\"\n```\n\nEvery script executed with `EVAL` is automatically cached by its SHA1 digest.\n\n## Key Properties\n\n- **Atomic execution**: All server activities are blocked during script execution\n- **Data locality**: Logic runs where data lives, reducing latency\n- **Conditional updates**: Can update multiple keys atomically across different data types\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/eval-intro.md >

employ programmatic control structures and use most of the [commands]() while executing to access the database.\\\\\\\\nBecause scripts execute in the server, reading and writing data from scripts is very efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis guarantees the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\nWhile executing the script, all server activities are blocked during its entire runtime.\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripting offers several properties that can be valuable in many cases.\\\\\\\\nThese include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Providing locality by executing logic where data lives. Data locality reduces overall latency and saves networking resources.\\\\\\\\n* Blocking semantics that ensure the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\n* Enabling the composition of simple capabilities that are either missing from Redis or are too niche to be a part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLua lets you run part of your application logic inside Redis.\\\\\\\\nSuch scripts can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine.\\\\\\\\nPresently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference]() page for complete documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough the server executes them, Eval scripts are regarded as a part of the client-side application, which is why they\\'re not named, versioned, or persisted.\\\\\\\\nSo all scripts may need to be reloaded by the application at any time if missing (after a server restart, fail-over to a replica, etc.).\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, [Redis Functions]() offer an alternative approach to programmability which allow the server itself to be extended with additional programmed logic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll start scripting with Redis by using the [`EVAL`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s our first example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello, scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, [`EVAL`]() takes two arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe first argument is a string that consists of the script\\'s Lua source code.\\\\\\\\nThe script doesn\\'t need to include any definitions of Lua function.\\\\\\\\nIt is just a Lua program that will run in the Redis engine\\'s context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second argument is the number of arguments that follow the script\\'s body, starting from the third argument, representing Redis key names.\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we used the value _0_ because we didn\\'t provide the script with any arguments, whether the names of keys or not.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.9816,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n

Redis commands from a Lua script either via [`redis.call()`]() or [`redis.pcall()`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two are nearly identical.\\\\\\\\nBoth execute a Redis command along with its provided arguments, if these represent a well-formed command.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as generic as possible and provide customized execution via their arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA script is loaded to the server\\'s cache by calling the [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() command and providing its source code.\\\\\\\\nThe server doesn\\'t execute the script, but instead just compiles and loads it to the server\\'s cache.\\\\\\\\nOnce loaded, you can execute the cached script with the SHA1 digest returned from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of loading and then executing a cached script:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Immabe a cached

Eval scripts are different than the default for functions that are mentioned below, see [Eval Flags]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you register a function or load an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nThis results in the following behavior:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. They can read and write data.\\\\\\\\n1. They can run in cluster mode, and are not able to run commands accessing keys of different hash slots.\\\\\\\\n1. Execution against a stale replica is denied to avoid inconsistent reads.\\\\\\\\n1.

This feature, which became available in Redis 7, supersedes the use of [EVAL]() in prior versions of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior versions of Redis made scripting available only via the [`EVAL`]() command, which allows a Lua script to be sent for execution by the server.\\\\\\\\nThe core use cases for [Eval Scripts]() is executing part of your application logic inside Redis, efficiently and atomically.\\\\\\\\nSuch script can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing [`EVAL`]() requires that the application sends the entire script for execution every time.\\\\\\\\nBecause this results in network and script compilation overheads, Redis provides an optimization in the form of the [`EVALSHA`]() command. By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes to already-established and well-liked ephemeral scripts, Redis v7.0 introduces Redis Functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.6902,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

a remote debugger consisting of a server, which is Redis itself, and a client, which is by default [`redis-cli`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Lua debugger is described in the [Lua scripts debugging]() section of the Redis documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen memory usage in Redis exceeds the `maxmemory` limit, the first write command encountered in the script that uses additional memory will cause the script to abort (unless [`redis.pcall`]() was used).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, an exception to the above is when the script\\'s first write command does not use additional memory, as is the case with  (for example, [`DEL`]() and [`LREM`]()).\\\\\\\\nIn this case, Redis will allow all commands in the script to run to ensure atomicity.\\\\\\\\nIf subsequent writes in the script consume additional memory, Redis\\' memory usage can exceed the threshold set by the `maxmemory` configuration directive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother scenario in which a script can cause memory usage to cross the `maxmemory` threshold is when the execution begins when Redis is slightly below `maxmemory`, so the script\\'s first write command is allowed.\\\\\\\\nAs the script executes, subsequent write commands consume more memory leading to the server using more RAM than the configured `maxmemory` directive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn those scenarios, you should consider setting the `maxmemory-policy` configuration directive to any values other than `noeviction`.\\\\\\\\nIn addition, Lua scripts should be as fast as possible so that eviction can kick in between executions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that you can change this behaviour by using [flags](#eval-flags)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally, when you run an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nHowever, starting with Redis 7.0, there\\'s a way to declare flags when creating a script in order to tell Redis how it should behave.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe way to do that is by using a Shebang statement on the first line of the script like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n#!lua flags=no-writes,allow-stale\\\\\\\\nlocal x = redis.call(\\'get\\',\\'x\\')\\\\\\\\nreturn x\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that as soon as Redis sees the `#!` comment, it\\'ll treat the script as if it declares flags, even if no flags are defined,\\\\\\\\nit still has a different set of defaults compared to a script without a `#!` line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother difference is that scripts without `#!` can run commands that access keys belonging to different cluster hash slots, but ones with `#!` inherit the default flags, so they cannot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to [Script flags]() to learn about the various scripts and the defaults.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_LbwiLvK5y5PDls8jkxGEy8', content='Found 9

Here's what's happening:\n\n**Trigger Mechanism:**\n- Whenever a client runs a command that adds more data, Redis checks memory usage\n- If memory exceeds `maxmemory`, Redis evicts keys according to the policy until memory drops back below the limit\n- Note: Large operations (like big set intersections) can temporarily exceed the limit\n\n**Why Keys Keep Growing:**\n\nIf keys keep growing despite `maxmemory` being set, check these possibilities:\n\n1. **Wrong eviction policy**: If you're using `noeviction` (the default), Redis will NOT evict keys. Instead, it returns errors on write commands while allowing reads to continue.\n\n2. **Using `volatile-*` policies without TTLs**: Policies like `volatile-lru`, `volatile-lfu`, `volatile-ttl` only evict keys that have an expiration set. If your keys don't have TTLs, these policies behave like `noeviction`.\n\n3. **Replication/persistence buffers**: Memory used by replication or AOF buffers is NOT counted toward `maxmemory`. Use `INFO memory` to check `mem_not_counted_for_evict`.\n\n## Available Eviction Policies\n\nConfigure with `maxmemory-policy`:\n\n**Recommended policies:**\n- `allkeys-lru` - Evicts least recently used keys (good default for most caches)\n- `allkeys-lfu` - Evicts least frequently used keys\n- `allkeys-lrm` - Evicts least recently modified keys (Redis 8.6+, useful for read-heavy workloads)\n- `allkeys-random` - Random eviction\n\n**TTL-based policies** (only work on keys with expiration):\n- `volatile-lru`, `volatile-lfu`, `volatile-lrm`, `volatile-ttl`, `volatile-random`\n\n**No eviction:**\n- `noeviction` - Returns errors instead of evicting (default)\n\n## Quick Fix\n\n```bash\n# Check current policy\n> CONFIG GET maxmemory-policy\n\n# Set to evict least recently used keys\n> CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru\n```\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md > Using the `maxmemory` configuration directive, Eviction policies]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["eviction", "maxmemory", "policy", "replica", "AOF", "KEYS", "memory"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/clients.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "7610affe-22df-4f38-9b91-b196aa36f524", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "c19f8a59-5305-445d-840c-d1edb1f533c1", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis memory management and eviction policies.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_koavE2nKxA4T6L8VvtyN0u', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis maxmemory eviction policy keys growing memory management', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_Lvi7Oph5qC3uhaaL9ulPzQ', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'glob': '*.md', 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'maxmemory|eviction'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_koavE2nKxA4T6L8VvtyN0u', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.1264,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Using the `maxmemory` configuration directive {#maxmem}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis is commonly used as a cache to speed up read accesses to a slower server\\\\\\\\nor database.

Therefore, such connections are never evicted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`maxmemory-clients` can be set permanently in the configuration file (`redis.conf`) or via the [`CONFIG SET`]() command.\\\\\\\\nThis setting can either be 0 (meaning no limit), a size in bytes (possibly with `mb`/`gb` suffix),\\\\\\\\nor a percentage of `maxmemory` by using the `%` suffix (e.g. setting it to `10%` would mean 10% of the `maxmemory` configuration).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe default setting is 0, meaning client eviction is turned off by default.\\\\\\\\nHowever, for any large production deployment, it is highly recommended to configure some non-zero `maxmemory-clients` value.\\\\\\\\nA value `5%`, for example, can be a good place to start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to flag a specific client connection to be excluded from the client eviction mechanism.\\\\\\\\nThis is useful for control path connections.\\\\\\\\nIf, for example, you have an application that monitors the server via the [`INFO`]() command and alerts you in case of a problem, you might want to make sure this connection isn\\'t evicted.\\\\\\\\nYou can do so using the following command (from the relevant client\\'s connection):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`CLIENT NO-EVICT`]() `on`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd you can revert that with:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`CLIENT NO-EVICT`]() `off`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more information and an example refer to the `maxmemory-clients` section in the default `redis.conf` file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClient eviction is available from Redis 7.0.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.5331,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Eviction policies\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Use the `maxmemory-policy` configuration directive to select the eviction\\\\\\\\npolicy you want to use when the limit set by `maxmemory` is reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following policies are available:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-   `noeviction`: Keys are not evicted but the server will return an error\\\\\\\\n    when you try to execute commands that cache new data. If your database uses replication\\\\\\\\n    then this condition only applies to the primary database. Note that commands that only\\\\\\\\n    read existing data still work as normal.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-lru`: Evict the [least recently used](#apx-lru) (LRU) keys.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-lrm`: Evict the [least recently modified](#lrm-eviction) (LRM) keys.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-lfu`: Evict the [least frequently used](#lfu-eviction) (LFU) keys.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-random`: Evict keys at random.\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-lru`: Evict the least recently used keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-lrm`: Evict the least recently modified keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-lfu`: Evict the least frequently used keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-random`: Evicts random keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-ttl`: Evict keys with an associated expiration (TTL) that have the shortest remaining TTL value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `volatile-xxx` policies behave like `noeviction` if no keys have an associated expiration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should choose an eviction policy that fits the way your app\\\\\\\\naccesses keys. You may be able to predict the access pattern in advance\\\\\\\\nbut you can also use information from the `INFO` command at runtime to\\\\\\\\ncheck or improve your choice of policy (see\\\\\\\\n[Using the `INFO` command](#using-the-info-command) below for more information).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a rule of thumb:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-lru` when you expect that a subset of elements will be accessed far\\\\\\\\n    more often than the rest. This is a very common case according to the\\\\\\\\n    [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), so\\\\\\\\n    `allkeys-lru` is a good default option if you have no reason to prefer any others.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-lrm` when you want to preserve frequently read data but evict data\\\\\\\\n    that hasn\\'t been modified recently. This is useful for read-heavy workloads where\\\\\\\\n    you want to distinguish between data that\\'s actively being updated versus data\\\\\\\\n    that\\'s only being read.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-random` when you expect all keys to be accessed with roughly equal\\\\\\\\n    frequency. An example of this is when your app reads data items in a repeating cycle.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `volatile-ttl` if your code can estimate which keys are good candidates for eviction\\\\\\\\n    and assign short TTLs to them. Note also that if you make good use of\\\\\\\\n    key expiration, then you are less likely to run into the cache memory limit because keys\\\\\\\\n    will often expire before they need to be evicted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `volatile-lru`, `volatile-lrm`, and `volatile-random` policies are mainly useful when you want to use\\\\\\\\na single Redis instance for both caching and for a set of persistent keys. However,\\\\\\\\nyou should consider running two separate Redis instances in a case like this, if possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that setting an `expire` value for a key costs memory, so a\\\\\\\\npolicy like `allkeys-lru` is more memory efficient since it doesn\\'t need an\\\\\\\\n`expire` value to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.283,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"LRM eviction {#lrm-eviction}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with Redis 8.6, the Least Recently Modified (LRM) eviction policy is available.

官方文档检索到了相关信息。\n\n## 排查步骤\n\n### 1. 检查从节点状态\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL replicas mymaster\n```\n\n重点关注：\n- `flags` 字段是否包含 `s_down`（主观下线）或 `o_down`（客观下线）\n- `master-link-status` 是否为 `ok`\n- `slave-priority` 是否为 0（优先级为 0 的从节点不会被提升）\n\n### 2. 检查主从复制延迟\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -h <slave-ip> -p 6379 INFO replication\n```\n\n查看：\n- `master_link_status:up` — 复制链路是否正常\n- `master_last_io_seconds_ago` — 最后一次与主节点通信的时间（如果过大说明复制中断）\n- `slave_repl_offset` vs 主节点的 `master_repl_offset` — 复制偏移量差距\n\n### 3. 检查 Sentinel 配置\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\nredis-cli -p 26379 CONFIG GET min-slaves-*\n```\n\n关键配置：\n- `min-slaves-to-write` — 如果设置过高，可能导致没有足够的\"健康\"从节点\n- `min-slaves-max-lag` — 复制延迟超过此值的从节点不被认为是\"good slave\"\n\n### 4. 查看 Sentinel 日志\n\n```bash\ngrep \"failover-abort\" /var/log/redis/sentinel.log\n```\n\n常见原因：\n- 所有从节点的 `slave-priority` 都是 0\n- 所有从节点复制延迟超过 `min-slaves-max-lag`\n- 所有从节点处于 `s_down` 或 `o_down` 状态\n- 网络分区导致 Sentinel 无法连接到从节点\n\n## 解决方案\n\n**临时恢复**：\n```bash\n# 如果某个从节点实际是健康的，手动触发故障转移\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster\n```\n\n**根本修复**：\n1. 修复从节点复制问题（检查网络、磁盘、内存）\n2. 调整 Sentinel 配置：\n   ```bash\n   redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL set mymaster min-slaves-max-lag 30\n   ```\n3. 确保至少有一个从节点的 `slave-priority > 0`\n\n[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 排查步骤]  \n[来源:

Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties.

So instead of a hard coded IP address and port, a client supporting Sentinel should optionally be able to take as input:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A list of ip:port pairs pointing to known Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* The name of the service, like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"timelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the procedure a client should follow in order to obtain the master address starting from the list of Sentinels and the service name.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.1331,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-027\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Algorithms and internals > Configuration propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Once a Sentinel is able to failover a master successfully, it will start to broadcast the new configuration so that the other Sentinels will update their information about a given master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor a failover to be considered successful, it requires that the Sentinel was able to send the `REPLICAOF NO ONE` command to the selected replica, and that the switch to master was later observed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) output of the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt this point, even if the reconfiguration of the replicas is in progress, the failover is considered to be successful, and all the Sentinels are required to start reporting the new configuration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe way a new configuration is propagated is the reason why we need that every\\\\\\\\nSentinel failover is authorized with a different version number (configuration epoch).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery Sentinel continuously broadcast its version of the configuration of a master using Redis Pub/Sub messages, both in the master and all the replicas.  At the same time all the Sentinels wait for messages to see what is the configuration\\\\\\\\nadvertised by the other Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfigurations are broadcast in the `__sentinel__:hello` Pub/Sub channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause every configuration has a different version number, the greater version\\\\\\\\nalways wins over smaller versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example the configuration for the master `mymaster` start with all the\\\\\\\\nSentinels believing the master is at 192.168.1.50:6379. This configuration\\\\\\\\nhas version 1. After some time a Sentinel is authorized to failover with version 2. If the failover is successful, it will start to broadcast a new configuration, let\\'s say 192.168.1.50:9000, with version 2. All the other instances will see this configuration and will update their configuration accordingly, since the new configuration has a greater version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that Sentinel guarantees a second liveness property: a set of\\\\\\\\nSentinels that are able to communicate will all converge to the same configuration with the higher version number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically if the net is partitioned, every partition will converge to the higher\\\\\\\\nlocal configuration. In the special case of no partitions, there is a single\\\\\\\\npartition and every Sentinel will agree about the configuration.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.2785,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/runbook/redis-failover.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册 > 故障现象\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"当 Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换（failover）后，应用层需要正确处理连接重建。本文档描述完整的故障恢复流程。\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- 应用日志出现大量 `READONLY You can\\'t write against a read only replica` 错误\\\\\\\\n- Sentinel 日志显示 `+switch-master` 事件\\\\\\\\n- 监控告警：Redis 写入延迟突增\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.2839,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel quick start > Configuring Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The Redis source distribution contains a file called `sentinel.conf`\\\\\\\\nthat is a self-documented example configuration file you can use to\\\\\\\\nconfigure Sentinel, however a typical minimal configuration file looks like the\\\\\\\\nfollowing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2\\\\\\\\n    sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 60000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor resque 192.168.1.3 6380 4\\\\\\\\n    sentinel down-after-milliseconds resque 10000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel failover-timeout resque 180000\\\\\\\\n    sentinel parallel-syncs resque 5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou only need to specify the masters to monitor, giving to each separated\\\\\\\\nmaster (that may have any number of replicas) a different name. There is no\\\\\\\\nneed to specify replicas, which are auto-discovered. Sentinel will update the\\\\\\\\nconfiguration automatically with additional information about replicas (in\\\\\\\\norder to retain the information in case of restart). The configuration is\\\\\\\\nalso rewritten every time a replica is promoted to master during a failover\\\\\\\\nand every time a new Sentinel is discovered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe example configuration above basically monitors two sets of Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances, each composed of a master and an undefined number of replicas.\\\\\\\\nOne set of instances is called `mymaster`, and the other `resque`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe meaning of the arguments of `sentinel monitor` statements is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <port> <quorum>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the sake of clarity, let\\'s check line by line what the configuration\\\\\\\\noptions mean:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first line is used to tell Redis to monitor a master called *mymaster*,\\\\\\\\nthat is at address 127.0.0.1 and port 6379, with a quorum of 2. Everything\\\\\\\\nis pretty obvious but the **quorum** argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The **quorum** is the number of Sentinels that need to agree about the fact the master is not reachable, in order to really mark the master as failing, and eventually start a failover procedure if possible.\\\\\\\\n* However **the quorum is only used to detect the failure**. In order to actually perform a failover, one of the Sentinels need to be elected leader for the failover and be authorized to proceed. This only happens with the vote of the **majority of the Sentinel processes**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example if you have 5 Sentinel processes, and the quorum for a given\\\\\\\\nmaster set to the value of 2, this is what happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If two Sentinels agree at the same time about the master being unreachable, one of the two will try to start a failover.\\\\\\\\n* If there are at least a total of three Sentinels reachable, the failover will be authorized and will actually start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn practical terms this means during failures **Sentinel never starts a failover if the majority of Sentinel processes are unable to talk** (aka no failover in the minority partition).\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='找到了相关文档。让我读取本地 runbook 中的详细排查步骤。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_DTxHRhabPJTwkT5V4nDN5M', name='Read', input={'file_path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/runbook/redis-failover.md'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_DTxHRhabPJTwkT5V4nDN5M', content=\"     1→---\\n     2→id: redis-failover-001\\n     3→title: Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\n     4→owner: sre-team\\n     5→tags: [redis, failover, runbook, 高可用]\\n     6→created: 2025-02-13\\n     7→last_reviewed: 2025-02-13\\n     8→confidence: high\\n     9→---\\n    10→\\n    11→# Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\n    12→\\n    13→## 概述\\n    14→\\n    15→当 Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换（failover）后，应用层需要正确处理连接重建。本文档描述完整的故障恢复流程。\\n    16→\\n    17→## 故障现象\\n    18→\\n    19→- 应用日志出现大量 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\\n    20→- Sentinel 日志显示 `+switch-master` 事件\\n    21→- 监控告警：Redis 写入延迟突增\\n    22→\\n    23→## 排查步骤\\n    24→\\n    25→### 1. 确认 Sentinel 状态\\n    26→\\n    27→```bash\\n    28→redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n    29→redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n    30→```\\n    31→\\n    32→确认新 master 的 IP 和端口。\\n    33→\\n    34→### 2. 检查新 master 状态\\n    35→\\n    36→```bash\\n    37→redis-cli -h <new-master-ip> -p 6379 INFO replication\\n    38→```\\n    39→\\n    40→确认 `role:master`，检查 `connected_slaves` 数量。\\n    41→\\n    42→### 3. 检查应用连接池\\n    43→\\n    44→确认应用是否已经切换到新 master：\\n    45→\\n    46→```bash\\n    47→# 查看应用连接数\\n    48→redis-cli -h <new-master-ip> CLIENT LIST | wc -l\\n    49→```\\n    50→\\n    51→## 恢复操作\\n    52→\\n    53→### 自动恢复（推荐）\\n    54→\\n    55→如果应用使用 Sentinel 客户端（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会自动切换。检查：\\n    56→\\n    57→1. 确认客户端配置了 Sentinel 地址而非直连 master\\n    58→2. 确认连接池的 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置已开启\\n    59→3. 等待 30 秒，观察错误率是否下降\\n    60→\\n    61→### 手动恢复\\n    62→\\n    63→如果应用直连 master IP：\\n    64→\\n    65→1. 获取新 master 地址：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\\n    66→2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\\n    67→3. 滚动重启应用 Pod\\n    68→\\n    69→```bash\\n    70→kubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\\n    71→```\\n    72→\\n    73→## 预防措施\\n    74→\\n    75→- 所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\\n    76→- 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\\n    77→- 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\\n    78→\\n    79→## 相关文档\\n    80→\\n    81→- Redis Sentinel 架构设计\\n    82→- 应用连接池配置规范\\n    83→\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

They can only operate on keys that hash to the same slot.\n\n### Why This Happens\n\nIn Redis cluster:\n- The key space is split into 16,384 hash slots\n- Each key is assigned to a slot using `CRC16(key) mod 16384`\n- SORT and SUNION must have all their keys in the same slot\n- If keys are on different nodes (different slots), you get CROSSSLOT error\n\n### Solutions\n\n**1. Use Hash Tags to Force Same Slot**\n\nWrap the common part of your keys in curly braces `{}`. Only the content inside braces is hashed:\n\n```redis\n# Instead of:\nSUNION users:active users:premium  # May fail with CROSSSLOT\n\n# Use hash tags:\nSUNION {users}:active {users}:premium  # All keys hash to same slot\n\n# For SORT with BY/GET patterns:\nSORT {mylist}:ids BY {mylist}:weight:* GET {mylist}:name:*\n```\n\n**2. Verify Slot Assignment**\n\nCheck which slot your keys belong to:\n\n```redis\nCLUSTER KEYSLOT users:active\nCLUSTER KEYSLOT {users}:active\n```\n\n**3. Redesign Your Data Model**\n\nIf hash tags aren't practical, consider:\n- Denormalizing data to avoid cross-slot operations\n- Using application-level merging instead of SUNION\n- Storing related data under a single key structure\n\n### Configuration-Specific Behavior\n\n| Configuration | SORT/SUNION Behavior |\n|--------------|---------------------|\n| Single instance (no clustering) | Cross-slot

The idea is that in a cluster with\\\\\\\\na master-replica setup, if the map between replicas and masters is fixed\\\\\\\\navailability is limited over time if multiple independent failures of single\\\\\\\\nnodes happen.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example in a cluster where every master has a single replica, the cluster\\\\\\\\ncan continue operations as long as either the master or the replica fail, but not\\\\\\\\nif both fail the same time. However there is a class of failures that are\\\\\\\\nthe independent failures of single nodes caused by hardware or software issues\\\\\\\\nthat can accumulate over time. For example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A has a single replica A1.\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted as new master.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails in an independent manner (unrelated to the failure of A). No other replica is available for promotion since node A is still down. The cluster cannot continue normal operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the map between masters and replicas is fixed, the only way to make the cluster\\\\\\\\nmore resistant to the above scenario is to add replicas to every master, however\\\\\\\\nthis is costly as it requires more instances of Redis to be executed, more\\\\\\\\nmemory, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn alternative is to create an asymmetry in the cluster, and let the cluster\\\\\\\\nlayout automatically change over time. For example the cluster may have three\\\\\\\\nmasters A, B, C. A and B have a single replica each, A1 and B1. However the master\\\\\\\\nC is different and has two replicas: C1 and C2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReplica migration is the process of automatic reconfiguration of a replica\\\\\\\\nin order to *migrate* to a master that has no longer coverage (no working\\\\\\\\nreplicas). With replica migration the scenario mentioned above turns into the\\\\\\\\nfollowing:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted.\\\\\\\\n* C2 migrates as replica of A1, that is otherwise not backed by any replica.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails as well.\\\\\\\\n* C2 is promoted as new master to replace A1.\\\\\\\\n* The cluster can continue the operations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -0.4951,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Key distribution model\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The cluster\\'s key space is split into 16384 slots, effectively setting an upper limit\\\\\\\\nfor the cluster size of 16384 master nodes (however, the suggested max size of\\\\\\\\nnodes is on the order of ~ 1000 nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach master node in a cluster handles a subset of the 16384 hash slots.\\\\\\\\nThe cluster is **stable** when there is no cluster reconfiguration in\\\\\\\\nprogress (i.e. where hash slots are being moved from one node to another).\\\\\\\\nWhen the cluster is stable, a single hash slot will be served by a single node\\\\\\\\n(however the serving node can have one or more replicas that will replace it in the case of net splits or failures,\\\\\\\\nand that can be used in order to scale read operations where reading stale data is acceptable).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe base algorithm used to map keys to hash slots is the following\\\\\\\\n(read the next paragraph for the hash tag exception to this rule):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe CRC16 is specified as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\\\\\\\\n* Width: 16 bit\\\\\\\\n* Poly: 1021 (That is actually x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\\\\\\\\n* Initialization: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Input byte: False\\\\\\\\n* Reflect Output CRC: False\\\\\\\\n* Xor constant to output CRC: 0000\\\\\\\\n* Output for \\\\\\\\\\\\\"123456789\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 31C3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n14 out of 16 CRC16 output bits are used (this is why there is\\\\\\\\na modulo 16384 operation in the formula above).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our tests CRC16 behaved remarkably well in distributing different kinds of\\\\\\\\nkeys evenly across the 16384 slots.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note**: A reference implementation of the CRC16 algorithm used is available in the Appendix A of this document.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Based on the search results, I found relevant information about multi-key operations in Redis cluster.

{"test_id": "redis-so-004", "category": "redis-so", "type": "unknown", "source": "qdrant", "query": "Redis AOF rewrite keeps failing with 'Can't open the append-only file', disk is not full", "status": "passed", "elapsed_seconds": 103.07341170310974, "cost_usd": 0.055383, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 2375, "answer": "Based on the search results, the \"Can't open the append-only file\" error during AOF rewrite is typically a **permissions issue**, not a disk space problem. Here's what's likely happening and how to fix it:\n\n## Root Cause\n\nDuring AOF rewrite, Redis forks a child process that writes to a **temporary file** before atomically replacing the old AOF. The error occurs when:\n\n1. **File permissions** - Redis process lacks write permissions to the AOF directory\n2. **Directory permissions** - The `appenddirname` directory (Redis 7.0+) or AOF file directory has restrictive permissions\n3. **SELinux/AppArmor** - Security policies blocking file creation\n4. **Parent directory ownership** - Directory owned by different user than Redis process\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n### 1. Check File Permissions\n```bash\n# Check Redis data directory permissions\nls -la /path/to/redis/data/\n\n# Check AOF directory (Redis 7.0+)\nls -la /path/to/redis/data/appendonlydir/\n\n# Verify Redis process user\nps aux | grep redis-server\n```\n\n### 2. Fix Permissions\n```bash\n# Set correct ownership (replace 'redis' with your Redis user)\nchown -R redis:redis /path/to/redis/data/\nchmod 755 /path/to/redis/data/\nchmod 644 /path/to/redis/data/*.aof\n```\n\n### 3. Check Redis Configuration\n```bash\n# Verify AOF settings\nredis-cli CONFIG GET dir\nredis-cli CONFIG GET appenddirname  # Redis 7.0+\nredis-cli CONFIG GET appendonly\n```\n\n### 4. Monitor Rewrite Status\n```bash\n# Check if rewrite is failing\nredis-cli INFO persistence | grep aof_last_bgrewrite_status\nredis-cli INFO persistence | grep aof_rewrite_in_progress\n```\n\n## How AOF Rewrite Works (Redis 7.0+)\n\nThe rewrite process creates temporary files that need write permissions:\n\n1. Child process writes new **base AOF** to temporary file\n2. Parent opens new **increment AOF** file\n3. Child signals completion → parent builds temp **manifest**\n4. Atomic exchange of manifest files\n5. Cleanup of old files\n\n**Any permission issue at steps 1-3 will cause the error.**\n\n## Additional Checks\n\n- **Check Redis logs** for detailed error messages: `tail -f /var/log/redis/redis-server.log`\n- **Verify ulimits**: `redis-cli CONFIG GET maxclients` and check `ulimit -n`\n- **Test manual rewrite**: `redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF` and watch logs\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md > Append-only file > How it works]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["AOF", "rewrite", "append", "monitor", "search"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "61472f5f-ff0d-4f4b-8797-ed8311e0aa4e", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "ccaa03a1-e5c0-45db-813f-ed05f19c45dd", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='I\\'ll search for information about Redis AOF rewrite failures with the \"Can\\'t open the append-only file\" error.')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_SJso3h2aF12Gvb8Al9BaHg', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': \"Can't open the append-only file|AOF rewrite|appendonly\"})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_f4bqyONVsuqa4caqPRRNnn', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': \"Redis AOF rewrite failing can't open append-only file permission error\", 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_SJso3h2aF12Gvb8Al9BaHg', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_f4bqyONVsuqa4caqPRRNnn', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8572,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Append-only file > How it works\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Log rewriting uses the same copy-on-write trick already in use for\\\\\\\\nsnapshotting.

However, if this is done during a [rewrite](#log-rewriting), you might end up with an invalid backup.\\\\\\\\nTo work around this you must disable AOF rewrites during the backup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Turn off automatic rewrites with<br/>\\\\\\\\n   [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) `auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 0`<br/>\\\\\\\\n   Make sure you don\\'t manually start a rewrite (using [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof)) during this time.\\\\\\\\n2.

If it\\'s 1, then you\\'ll need to wait for the rewrite to complete.\\\\\\\\n3. Now you can safely copy the files in the `appenddirname` directory.\\\\\\\\n4. Re-enable rewrites when done:<br/>\\\\\\\\n   [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) `auto-aof-rewrite-percentage <prev-value>`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:** If you want to minimize the time AOF rewrites are disabled you may create hard links to the files in `appenddirname` (in step 3 above) and then re-enable rewrites (step 4) after the hard links are created.\\\\\\\\nNow you can copy/tar the hardlinks and delete them when done. This works because Redis guarantees that it\\\\\\\\nonly appends to files in this directory, or completely replaces them if necessary, so the content should be\\\\\\\\nconsistent at any given point in time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:** If you want to handle the case of the server being restarted during the backup and make sure no rewrite will automatically start after the restart you can change step 1 above to also persist the updated configuration via [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite).\\\\\\\\nJust make sure to re-enable automatic rewrites when done (step 4) and persist it with another [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior to version 7.0.0 backing up the AOF file can be done simply by copying the aof file (like backing up the RDB snapshot).

命令是导致高延迟的常见原因**。KEYS 会阻塞 Redis 服务器直到扫描完所有键，在大型数据库上可能造成数秒级的阻塞。\n\n## 解决方案\n\n### 1. 立即止损：禁止使用 KEYS 命令\n\n- **紧急措施**：通过 `redis.conf` 或 `CONFIG SET` 重命名 KEYS 命令，防止继续被调用\n- **排查来源**：检查应用代码、监控脚本、运维工具中是否在生产环境调用了 KEYS\n\n### 2. 替代方案：使用 SCAN 命令\n\nSCAN 是专为生产环境设计的增量迭代命令，特点：\n- **非阻塞**：每次只返回少量键，不会长时间阻塞服务器\n- **游标迭代**：通过游标分批获取结果\n- **适用场景**：需要遍历大量键的场景\n\n**示例用法**：\n```bash\n# 初始调用，游标从 0 开始\nSCAN 0 MATCH pattern* COUNT 100\n\n# 根据返回的游标继续迭代\nSCAN <returned_cursor> MATCH pattern* COUNT 100\n```\n\n### 3. 相关命令族\n\n根据数据类型选择对应的 SCAN 命令：\n- `SCAN` - 遍历数据库键\n- `SSCAN` - 遍历 Set 成员\n- `HSCAN` - 遍历 Hash 字段\n- `ZSCAN` - 遍历 Sorted Set 成员\n\n### 4. 其他优化建议\n\n如果需要按模式查找键，考虑：\n- **使用 Sets 维护索引**：将需要查询的键名存入 Set，用 SMEMBERS 或 SSCAN 查询\n- **重新设计键命名规范**：让键名更易于通过 SCAN 的 MATCH 参数过滤\n\n## 重要提示\n\n⚠️ **KEYS 命令仅应用于调试和特殊操作**（如键空间布局变更），绝不应出现在生产环境的常规应用代码中。\n\n---\n\n**来源**：\n- [Redis 延迟诊断文档 > Latency generated by slow commands](来自 Qdrant 索引:

document will help you understand what the problem could be if you\\\\\\\\nare experiencing latency problems with Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this context *latency* is the maximum delay between the time a client\\\\\\\\nissues a command and the time the reply to the command is received by the\\\\\\\\nclient. Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for. However\\\\\\\\nthere is not just a single swap field since the smaps file contains the\\\\\\\\ndifferent memory maps of our Redis process (The memory layout of a process\\\\\\\\nis more complex than a simple linear array of pages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince we are interested in all the memory swapped by our process the first thing\\\\\\\\nto do is to grep for the Swap field across all the file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | grep \\'Swap:\\'\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf everything is 0 kB, or if there are sporadic 4k entries, everything is\\\\\\\\nperfectly normal. Actually in our example instance (the one of a real web\\\\\\\\nsite running Redis and serving hundreds of users every second) there are a\\\\\\\\nfew entries that show more swapped pages. To investigate if this is a serious\\\\\\\\nproblem or not we change our command in order to also print the size of the\\\\\\\\nmemory map:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | egrep \\'^(Swap|Size)\\'\\\\\\\\n    Size:                316 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 40 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                132 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:             720896 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               4096 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               4096 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               4096 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               1272 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 16 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 84 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                144 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                108 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                272 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see from the output, there is a map of 720896 kB\\\\\\\\n(with just 12 kB swapped) and 156 kB more swapped in another map:\\\\\\\\nbasically a very small amount of our memory is swapped so this is not\\\\\\\\ngoing to create any problem at all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf instead a non trivial amount of the process memory is swapped on disk your\\\\\\\\nlatency problems are likely related to swapping.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server.

They can be used to build a **sliding-window rate limiter** to prevent excessive API requests.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe sliding-window rate limiter uses sorted sets where:\n- **Members**: Unique request identifiers (e.g., timestamps or UUIDs)\n- **Scores**: Timestamps of when requests occurred\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Add the current request** with its timestamp as both member and score:\n   ```\n   ZADD rate_limiter:{user_id} {current_timestamp} {request_id}\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove old requests** outside the time window:\n   ```\n   ZREMRANGEBYSCORE rate_limiter:{user_id} -inf {current_timestamp - window_size}\n   ```\n\n3. **Count requests** in the current window:\n   ```\n   ZCOUNT rate_limiter:{user_id} {current_timestamp - window_size} {current_timestamp}\n   ```\n\n4. **Check the limit**: If count < limit, allow the request; otherwise, reject it.\n\n## Key Commands\n\n- **ZADD**: Adds new request with timestamp score (O(log(n)) complexity)\n- **ZREMRANGEBYSCORE**: Removes requests older than the time window\n- **ZCOUNT** or **ZRANGE**: Counts requests in the current window\n- **ZRANK/ZREVRANK**: Gets position of elements (useful for ranking)\n\n## Performance Characteristics\n\n- Sorted sets use a dual-ported data structure (skip list + hash table)\n- Adding elements: O(log(n)) time complexity\n- Range operations: Very efficient for time-based queries\n- Elements are automatically kept sorted by score (timestamp)\n\n## Example Use Case\n\nFor a rate limiter allowing 100 requests per minute:\n- Window size: 60 seconds\n- Each request adds an entry with current timestamp\n- Remove entries older than 60 seconds\n- If count ≤ 100, allow request; otherwise, deny\n\n[Source: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.6-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sorted set", "score", "ZADD", "search"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.6-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisstack/redisstack-7.2-release-notes.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "bb38ee2b-dbd4-4f3c-863a-60757822af19", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "b2303bc3-3b03-4365-b92c-3cce802b36c8", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about implementing a rate limiter using Redis sorted sets.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_7smMNCJHwgg9UPjNTUpMkq', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'rate limit'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_aj3nARL7DzrLIPvqVzubOH', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'rate limiter Redis sorted sets implementation', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_7smMNCJHwgg9UPjNTUpMkq', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_aj3nARL7DzrLIPvqVzubOH', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.3041,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis sorted set is a collection of unique strings (members) ordered by an associated score.\\\\\\\\nWhen more than one string has the same score, the strings are ordered lexicographically.\\\\\\\\nSome use cases for sorted sets include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Leaderboards. For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.1621,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Lexicographical scores\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In version Redis 2.8, a new feature was introduced that allows\\\\\\\\ngetting ranges lexicographically, assuming elements in a sorted set are all\\\\\\\\ninserted with the same identical score (elements are compared with the C\\\\\\\\n`memcmp` function, so it is guaranteed that there is no collation, and every\\\\\\\\nRedis instance will reply with the same output).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe main commands to operate with lexicographical ranges are [`ZRANGEBYLEX`](),\\\\\\\\n[`ZREVRANGEBYLEX`](), [`ZREMRANGEBYLEX`]() and [`ZLEXCOUNT`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, let\\'s add again our list of famous racers, but this time\\\\\\\\nusing a score of zero for all the elements. We\\'ll see that because of the sorted sets ordering rules, they are already sorted lexicographically. Using [`ZRANGEBYLEX`]() we can ask for lexicographical ranges:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGEBYLEX racer_scores [A [L\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRanges can be inclusive or exclusive (depending on the first character),\\\\\\\\nalso string infinite and minus infinite are specified respectively with\\\\\\\\nthe `+` and `-` strings. See the documentation for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is important because it allows us to use sorted sets as a generic\\\\\\\\nindex. For example, if you want to index elements by a 128-bit unsigned\\\\\\\\ninteger argument, all you need to do is to add elements into a sorted\\\\\\\\nset with the same score (for example 0) but with a 16 byte prefix\\\\\\\\nconsisting of **the 128 bit number in big endian**. Since numbers in big\\\\\\\\nendian, when ordered lexicographically (in raw bytes order) are actually\\\\\\\\nordered numerically as well, you can ask for ranges in the 128 bit space,\\\\\\\\nand get the element\\'s value discarding the prefix\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdating the score: leaderboards\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust a final note about sorted sets before switching to the next topic.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets\\' scores can be updated at any time. Just calling [`ZADD`]() against\\\\\\\\nan element already included in the sorted set will update its score\\\\\\\\n(and position) with O(log(N)) time complexity.  As such, sorted sets are suitable\\\\\\\\nwhen there are tons of updates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of this characteristic a common use case is leaderboards.\\\\\\\\nThe typical application is a Facebook game where you combine the ability to\\\\\\\\ntake users sorted by their high score, plus the get-rank operation, in order\\\\\\\\nto show the top-N users, and the user rank in the leader board (e.g., \\\\\\\\\\\\\"you are\\\\\\\\nthe #4932 best score here\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.752,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Learn more\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* There are two ways we can use a sorted set to represent a leaderboard. If we know a racer\\'s new score, we can update it directly via the [`ZADD`]() command. However, if we want to add points to an existing score, we can use the [`ZINCRBY`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 100 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wood\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 100 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 150 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> ZINCRBY racer_scores 50 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wood\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"150\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZINCRBY racer_scores 50 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"200\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll see that [`ZADD`]() returns 0 when the member already exists (the score is updated), while [`ZINCRBY`]() returns the new score. The score for racer Henshaw went from 100, was changed to 150 with no regard for what score was there before, and then was incremented by 50 to 200.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`ZADD`]() adds a new member and associated score to a sorted set. If the member already exists, the score is updated.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZRANGE`]() returns members of a sorted set, sorted within a given range.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZRANK`]() returns the rank of the provided member, assuming the sorted set is in ascending order.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZREVRANK`]() returns the rank of the provided member, assuming the sorted set is in descending order.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of sorted set commands](?group=sorted-set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost sorted set operations are O(log(n)), where _n_ is the number of members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExercise some caution when running the [`ZRANGE`]() command with large returns values (e.g., in the tens of thousands or more).\\\\\\\\nThis command\\'s time complexity is O(log(n) + m), where _m_ is the number of results returned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis sorted sets are sometimes used for indexing other Redis data structures.\\\\\\\\nIf you need to index and query your data, consider the [JSON]() data type and the [Redis Query Engine]() features.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Redis Sorted Sets Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUKlxdBQZ7g) is an entertaining introduction to sorted sets in Redis.\\\\\\\\n* [Redis University\\'s RU101](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/) explores Redis sorted sets in detail.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4312,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples > What are Lists?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To explain the List data type it\\'s better to start with a little bit of theory,\\\\\\\\nas the term *List* is often used in an improper way by information technology\\\\\\\\nfolks. For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4041,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Limits\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The [`SADD`]() command adds new elements to a set.

For instance we may want a list of all the\\\\\\\\nbikes racing in France, the USA, and some other races. We can do this using\\\\\\\\nthe [`SINTER`]() command, which performs the intersection between different\\\\\\\\nsets. In addition to intersection you can also perform\\\\\\\\nunions, difference, and more. For example \\\\\\\\nif we add a third race we can see some of these commands in action:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:usa bike:1 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:italy bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> SINTER bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SUNION bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(empty array)\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll note that the [`SDIFF`]() command returns an empty array when the\\\\\\\\ndifference between all sets is empty.

This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process.

\\\\\"To communicate with the Redis server, Redis clients use a protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.3118,\\\\n

\\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sending commands to a Redis server\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"New RESP connections should begin the session by calling the [`HELLO`]() command.\\\\\\\\nThis practice accomplishes two things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. It allows servers to be backward compatible with RESP2 versions.\\\\\\\\n  This is needed in Redis to make the transition to version 3 of the protocol gentler.\\\\\\\\n2. The [`HELLO`]() command returns information about the server and the protocol that the client can use for different goals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`HELLO`]() command has the following high-level syntax:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HELLO <protocol-version> [optional-arguments]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first argument of the command is the protocol version we want the connection to be set.\\\\\\\\nBy default, the connection starts in RESP2 mode.\\\\\\\\nIf we specify a connection version that is too big and unsupported by the server, it should reply with a `-NOPROTO` error. Example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 4\\\\\\\\n    Server: -NOPROTO sorry, this protocol version is not supported.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\nAt that point, the client may retry with a lower protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the client can easily detect a server that is only able to speak RESP2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR unknown command \\'HELLO\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client can then proceed and use RESP2 to communicate with the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that even if the protocol\\'s version is supported, the [`HELLO`]() command may return an error, perform no action and remain in RESP2 mode. \\\\\\\\nFor example, when used with invalid authentication credentials in the command\\'s optional `AUTH` clause:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3 AUTH default mypassword\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR invalid password\\\\\\\\n    (the connection remains in RESP2 mode)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA successful reply to the [`HELLO`]() command is a map reply.\\\\\\\\nThe information in the reply is partly server-dependent, but certain fields are mandatory for all the RESP3 implementations:\\\\\\\\n* **server**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"redis\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (or other software name).\\\\\\\\n* **version**: the server\\'s version.\\\\\\\\n* **proto**: the highest supported version of the RESP protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis\\' RESP3 implementation, the following fields are also emitted:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **id**: the connection\\'s identifier (ID).\\\\\\\\n* **mode**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"standalone\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cluster\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **role**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"master\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"replica\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **modules**: list of loaded modules as an Array of Bulk Strings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that you are familiar with the RESP serialization format, you can use it to help write a Redis client library.\\\\\\\\nWe can further specify how the interaction between the client and the server works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A client sends the Redis server an [array](#arrays) consisting of only bulk strings.\\\\\\\\n* A Redis server replies to clients, sending any valid RESP data type as a reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, for example, a typical interaction could be the following.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client sends the command `LLEN mylist` to get the length of the list stored at the key _mylist_.\\\\\\\\nThen the server replies with an [integer](#integers) reply as in the following example (`C:` is the client, `S:` the server).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: $4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: LLEN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: $6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: mylist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    S: :48293\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs usual, we separate different parts of the protocol with newlines for simplicity, but the actual interaction is the client sending `*2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLLEN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nmylist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` as a

supports several data types.\\\\\\\\nIn RESP, the first byte of data determines its type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis generally uses RESP as a [request-response](#request-response-model) protocol in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients send commands to a Redis server as an [array](#arrays) of [bulk strings](#bulk-strings).\\\\\\\\n  The first (and sometimes also the second) bulk string in the array is the command\\'s name.\\\\\\\\n  Subsequent elements of the array are the arguments for the command.\\\\\\\\n* The server replies with a RESP type.\\\\\\\\n  The reply\\'s type is determined by the command\\'s implementation and possibly by the client\\'s protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a binary protocol that uses control sequences encoded in standard ASCII.\\\\\\\\nThe `A` character, for example, is encoded with the binary byte of value 65.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the characters CR (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`), LF (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) and SP (` `) have binary byte values of 13, 10 and 32, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` (CRLF) is the protocol\\'s _terminator_, which **always** separates its parts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first byte in an RESP-serialized payload always identifies its type.\\\\\\\\nSubsequent bytes constitute the type\\'s contents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe categorize every RESP data type as either _simple_, _bulk_ or _aggregate_.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimple types are similar to scalars in programming languages that represent plain literal values. Booleans and Integers are such examples.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP strings are either _simple_ or _bulk_.\\\\\\\\nSimple strings never contain carriage return (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`) or line feed (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) characters.\\\\\\\\nBulk strings can contain any binary data and may also be referred to as _binary_ or _blob_.\\\\\\\\nNote that bulk strings may be further encoded and decoded, e.g. with a wide multi-byte encoding, by the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAggregates, such as Arrays and Maps, can have varying numbers of sub-elements and nesting levels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following table summarizes the RESP data types that Redis supports:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| RESP data type | Minimal protocol version | Category | First byte |\\\\\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\\\\\n| [Simple

accepts commands composed of different arguments.\\\\\\\\nThen, the server processes the command and sends the reply back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the simplest model possible; however, there are some exceptions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis requests can be [pipelined](#multiple-commands-and-pipelining).\\\\\\\\n  Pipelining enables clients to send multiple commands at once and wait for replies later.\\\\\\\\n* When a RESP2 connection subscribes to a [Pub/Sub]() channel, the protocol changes semantics and becomes a *push* protocol.\\\\\\\\n  The client no longer requires sending commands because the server will automatically send new messages to the client (for the channels the client is subscribed to) as soon as they are received.\\\\\\\\n* The [`MONITOR`]() command.\\\\\\\\n  Invoking the [`MONITOR`]() command switches the connection to an ad-hoc push mode.\\\\\\\\n  The protocol of this mode is not specified but is obvious to parse.\\\\\\\\n* [Protected mode]().\\\\\\\\n  Connections opened from a non-loopback address to a Redis while in protected mode are denied and terminated by the server.\\\\\\\\n  Before terminating the connection, Redis unconditionally sends a `-DENIED` reply, regardless of whether the client writes to the socket.\\\\\\\\n* The [RESP3 Push type](#resp3-pushes).\\\\\\\\n  As the name suggests, a push type allows the server to send out-of-band data to the connection.\\\\\\\\n  The server may push data at any time, and the data isn\\'t necessarily related to specific commands executed by the client.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nExcluding these exceptions, the Redis protocol is a simple request-response protocol.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7109,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

\\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Clients send commands to the Redis server as RESP arrays.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, some Redis commands that return collections of elements use arrays as their replies. \\\\\\\\nAn example is the [`LRANGE`]() command that returns elements of a list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP Arrays\\' encoding uses the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *<number-of-elements>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n<element-1>...<element-n>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An asterisk (`*`) as the first byte.\\\\\\\\n* One or more decimal digits (`0`..`9`) as the number of elements in the array as an unsigned, base-10 value.\\\\\\\\n* The CRLF terminator.\\\\\\\\n* An additional RESP type for every element of the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo an empty Array is just the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhereas the encoding of an array consisting of the two bulk strings \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"world\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nhello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nworld\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see, after the `*<count>CRLF` part prefixing the array, the other data types that compose the array are concatenated one after the other.\\\\\\\\nFor example, an Array of three integers is encoded as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArrays can contain mixed data types.\\\\\\\\nFor instance, the following encoding is of a list of four integers and a bulk string:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(The raw RESP encoding is split into multiple lines for readability).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first line the server sent is `*5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`.\\\\\\\\nThis numeric value tells the client that five reply types are about to follow it.\\\\\\\\nThen, every successive reply constitutes an element in the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of the aggregate RESP types support nesting.\\\\\\\\nFor example, a nested array of two arrays is encoded as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    +Hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    -World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(The raw RESP encoding is split into multiple lines for readability).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above encodes a two-element array.\\\\\\\\nThe first element is an array that, in turn, contains three integers (1, 2, 3).\\\\\\\\nThe second element is another array containing a simple string and an error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn some places, the RESP Array type may be referred to as _multi bulk_.\\\\\\\\nThe two are the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nil-array-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n

Here's why this specific number was chosen:\n\n**Technical Reasoning:**\n- The algorithm uses `CRC16(key) mod 16384` to map keys to slots\n- CRC16 produces a 16-bit output, but only **14 out of 16 bits are used** (hence 2^14 = 16384)\n- This effectively sets an upper limit of 16384 master nodes (though the recommended max is ~1000 nodes)\n- In testing, CRC16 with this modulo operation distributed different types of keys evenly across all slots\n\n## How Keys Are Mapped\n\n**Base Algorithm:**\n```\nHASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\n```\n\n**CRC16 Specification:**\n- Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\n- Width: 16 bit\n- Poly: 1021 (x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\n- Initialization: 0000\n- Output for \"123456789\": 31C3\n\n**Hash Tags Exception:**\nIf a key contains a substring between `{}` brackets, only the content inside the brackets is hashed. This allows you to force multiple keys into the same slot:\n\n- `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` → both hash to the same slot (only \"123\" is hashed)\n- This enables multi-key operations on related keys\n\n**Slot Distribution:**\nEach master node handles a subset of the 16384 slots. For example, in a 3-node cluster:\n- Node A: slots 0-5500\n- Node B: slots 5501-11000  \n- Node C: slots 11001-16383\n\nThis design makes it easy to add/remove nodes by moving hash slots between nodes

**hash slot**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute the hash\\\\\\\\nslot for a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo\\\\\\\\n16384.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,\\\\\\\\nso, for example, you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.\\\\\\\\n* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.\\\\\\\\n* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes it easy to add and remove cluster nodes. For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.7251,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Hash tags > Hash slot example code\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Commands accepting a glob-style pattern, including [`KEYS`](/commands/keys), [`SCAN`](/commands/scan) and [`SORT`](/commands/sort), are optimized for patterns that imply a single slot.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if all keys that can match a pattern must belong to a specific slot, only this slot is searched for keys matching the pattern.\\\\\\\\nThe pattern slot optimization is introduced in Redis 8.0.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe optimization kicks in when the pattern meets the following conditions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* the pattern contains a hashtag,\\\\\\\\n* there are no wildcards or escape characters before the hashtag, and\\\\\\\\n* the hashtag within curly braces doesn\\'t contain any wildcards or escape characters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, `SCAN 0 MATCH {abc}*` can successfully recognize the hashtag and scans only the slot corresponding to `abc`.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the patterns `*{abc}`, `{a*c}`, or `{a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*bc}` cannot recognize the hashtag, so all slots need to be scanned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding the hash tags exception, the following is an implementation of the `HASH_SLOT` function in Ruby and C language.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRuby example code:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    def HASH_SLOT(key)\\\\\\\\n        s = key.index \\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n        if s\\\\\\\\n            e = key.index \\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\\\\\\\\\\\\\",s+1\\\\\\\\n            if e && e != s+1\\\\\\\\n                key = key[s+1..e-1]\\\\\\\\n            end\\\\\\\\n        end\\\\\\\\n        crc16(key) % 16384\\\\\\\\n    end\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nC example code:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    unsigned int HASH_SLOT(char *key, int keylen) {\\\\\\\\n        int s, e; /* start-end indexes of { and } */\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        /* Search the first occurrence of \\'{\\'. */\\\\\\\\n        for (s = 0; s < keylen; s++)\\\\\\\\n            if (key[s] == \\'{\\') break;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        /* No \\'{\\' ?

This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.8861,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > MOVED Redirection\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis client is free to send queries to every node in the cluster, including\\\\\\\\nreplica nodes.

malloc）的工作机制导致的：\n\n1. **删除键后内存不会立即归还给操作系统**：当你删除大量键后，虽然 Redis 报告的用户内存减少了，但 RSS（实际物理内存占用）仍然保持在峰值附近。这是因为底层分配器无法轻易释放内存，特别是当被删除的键和仍然存在的键分配在同一内存页上时。\n\n2. **碎片率计算**：碎片率 = RSS（实际物理内存）/ 当前使用内存。当你的内存使用曾经达到峰值（如 10GB），后来释放了部分数据（降到 2GB），RSS 仍然保持高位，导致碎片率很高。\n\n## 处理方法\n\n### 1. **内存分配器会自动重用碎片空间**\n- 虽然内存没有归还给 OS，但分配器会智能地重用这些空闲内存块\n- 当你继续添加新键时，RSS 会保持稳定而不是继续增长\n- 分配器会尝试重用之前释放的内存空间\n\n### 2. **使用 jemalloc 而非 libc**\n- Redis 默认使用 jemalloc 分配器，它比 libc malloc 更能防止碎片问题\n- 确保你的 Redis 编译时使用了 jemalloc（这是大多数发行版的默认配置）\n\n### 3. **按峰值内存规划容量**\n- 你需要按**峰值内存使用量**来规划服务器容量\n- 如果你的工作负载有时需要 10GB，即使大部分时间只用 5GB，也需要按 10GB 来配置\n\n### 4. **设置 maxmemory 限制**\n- 设置明确的 `maxmemory` 限制，防止 Redis 消耗过多内存\n- 建议值：如果系统有 10GB 空闲内存，设置为 8-9GB（预留碎片和其他开销）\n- 配置示例：`maxmemory 8gb`\n\n### 5. **注意碎片率的可靠性**\n- 当前内存使用量远低于历史峰值时，碎片率指标不可靠\n- 这种情况下的高碎片率是正常现象，不一定需要处理\n\n## 配置建议\n\n```bash\n# 在 redis.conf 中设置\nmaxmemory 8gb\nmaxmemory-policy noeviction  # 达到限制时返回错误而不是驱逐键\n```\n\n## 监控命令\n\n使用以下命令监控内存使用情况：\n- `MEMORY DOCTOR` - 获取内存诊断建议\n- `INFO memory` - 查看详细内存统计信息\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Memory allocation]",

as the `maxmemory`\\\\\\\\nsetting enables (however there are small extra allocations possible).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe exact value can be set in the configuration file or set later via\\\\\\\\n[`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) (for more info, see [Using memory as an LRU cache]()).\\\\\\\\nThere are a few things that should be noted about how Redis manages memory:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis will not always free up (return) memory to the OS when keys are removed.\\\\\\\\nThis is not something special about Redis, but it is how most malloc() implementations work.\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you fill an instance with 5GB worth of data, and then\\\\\\\\nremove the equivalent of 2GB of data, the Resident Set Size (also known as\\\\\\\\nthe RSS, which is the number of memory pages consumed by the process)\\\\\\\\nwill probably still be around 5GB, even if Redis will claim that the user\\\\\\\\nmemory is around 3GB.  This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory error for write commands if and when it reaches the \\\\\\\\nlimit - which in turn may result in errors in the application but will not render the \\\\\\\\nwhole machine dead because of memory starvation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.4668,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/arm.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ARM support\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Building Redis in the Pi\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis versions 4.0 and above support the ARM processor in general, and\\\\\\\\nthe Raspberry Pi specifically, as a main platform. Every new release of Redis is tested on the Pi\\\\\\\\nenvironment, and we update this documentation page with information about supported devices and other useful information. While Redis does run on Android, in the future we look forward to extend our testing efforts to Android\\\\\\\\nto also make it an officially supported platform.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe believe that Redis is ideal for IoT and embedded devices for several\\\\\\\\nreasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis has a very small memory footprint and CPU requirements. It can run in small devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero without impacting the overall performance, using a small amount of memory while delivering good performance for many use cases.\\\\\\\\n* The data structures of Redis are often an ideal way to model IoT/embedded use cases. Some examples include accumulating time series data, receiving or queuing commands to execute or respond to send back to the remote servers, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n* Modeling data inside Redis can be very useful in order to make in-device decisions for appliances that must respond very quickly or when the remote servers are offline.\\\\\\\\n* Redis can be used as a communication system between the processes running in the device.\\\\\\\\n* The append-only file storage of Redis is well suited for SSD cards.\\\\\\\\n* The stream data structure included in Redis versions 5.0 and higher was specifically designed for time series applications and has a very low memory overhead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux on ARM allows to trap unaligned accesses and fix them inside the kernel\\\\\\\\nin order to continue the execution of the offending program instead of\\\\\\\\ngenerating a `SIGBUS`. Redis 4.0 and greater are fixed in order to avoid any kind\\\\\\\\nof unaligned access, so there is no need to have a specific value for this\\\\\\\\nkernel configuration. Even when kernel alignment fixing set as disabled Redis should\\\\\\\\nrun as expected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Download Redis version 4.0 or higher.\\\\\\\\n* Use `make` as usual to create the executable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is nothing special in the process. The only difference is that by\\\\\\\\ndefault, Redis uses the `libc` allocator instead of defaulting to `jemalloc`\\\\\\\\nas it does in other Linux based environments. This is because we believe\\\\\\\\nthat for the small use cases inside embedded devices, memory fragmentation\\\\\\\\nis unlikely to be a problem.

Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes.

A partition occurred isolating the old master.\\\\\\\\nSentinels 1 and 2 started a failover promoting Sentinel 1 as the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Sentinel properties guarantee that Sentinel 1 and 2 now have the new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration for the master. However Sentinel 3 has still the old configuration\\\\\\\\nsince it lives in a different partition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe know that Sentinel 3 will get its configuration updated when the network\\\\\\\\npartition will heal, however what happens during the partition if there\\\\\\\\nare clients partitioned with the old master?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients will be still able to write to Redis 3, the old master. When the\\\\\\\\npartition will rejoin, Redis 3 will be turned into a replica of Redis 1, and\\\\\\\\nall the data written during the partition will be lost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDepending on your configuration you may want or not that this scenario happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a cache, it could be handy that Client B is still able to write to the old master, even if its data will be lost.\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a store, this is not good and you need to configure the system in order to partially prevent this problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis is asynchronously replicated, there is no way to totally prevent data loss in this scenario, however you can bound the divergence between Redis 3 and Redis 1\\\\\\\\nusing the following Redis configuration option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration the Redis 3 in the above example will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel 3 configuration will converge to\\\\\\\\nthe new one, and Client B will be able to fetch a valid configuration and continue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general Redis + Sentinel as a whole are an **eventually consistent system** where the merge function is **last failover wins**, and the data from old masters are discarded to replicate the data of the current master, so there is always a window for losing acknowledged writes. This is due to Redis asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication and the discarding nature of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merge function of the system. Note that this is not a limitation of Sentinel itself, and if you orchestrate the failover with a strongly consistent replicated state machine, the same properties will still apply. There are only two ways to avoid losing acknowledged writes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Use synchronous replication (and a proper consensus algorithm to run a replicated state machine).\\\\\\\\n2. Use an eventually consistent system where different versions of the same object can be merged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis currently is not able to use any of the above systems, and is currently outside the development goals. However there are proxies implementing solution \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on top of Redis stores such as SoundCloud [Roshi](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi), or Netflix [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel persistent state\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel state is persisted in the sentinel configuration file. For example\\\\\\\\nevery time a new configuration is received, or created (leader Sentinels), for\\\\\\\\na master, the configuration is persisted on disk together with the configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch.

Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties. In this document concepts will be introduced gradually\\\\\\\\nstarting from basic information needed in order to understand the basic\\\\\\\\nproperties of Sentinel, to more complex information (that are optional) in\\\\\\\\norder to understand how exactly Sentinel works.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5259,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel quick start > Example Sentinel deployments > Example 1: just two Sentinels, DON\\'T DO THIS\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"+----+         +----+\\\\\\\\n    | M1 |---------| R1 |\\\\\\\\n    | S1 |         | S2 |\\\\\\\\n    +----+         +----+\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Configuration: quorum = 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* In this setup, if the master M1 fails, R1 will be promoted since the two Sentinels can reach agreement about the failure (obviously with quorum set to 1) and can also authorize a failover because the majority is two.

However in\\\\\\\\nthe above setup there is a higher risk due to clients being partitioned away\\\\\\\\nwith an old master, like in the following picture:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n             +----+\\\\\\\\n             | M1 |\\\\\\\\n             | S1 | <- C1 (writes will be lost)\\\\\\\\n             +----+\\\\\\\\n                |\\\\\\\\n                /\\\\\\\\n                /\\\\\\\\n    +------+    |    +----+\\\\\\\\n    | [M2] |----+----| R3 |\\\\\\\\n    | S2   |         | S3 |\\\\\\\\n    +------+         +----+\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this case a network partition isolated the old master M1, so the\\\\\\\\nreplica R2 is promoted to master. However clients, like C1, that are\\\\\\\\nin the same partition as the old master, may continue to write data\\\\\\\\nto the old master. This data will be lost forever since when the partition\\\\\\\\nwill heal, the master will be reconfigured as a replica of the new master,\\\\\\\\ndiscarding its data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis problem can be mitigated using the following Redis replication\\\\\\\\nfeature, that allows to stop accepting writes if a master detects that\\\\\\\\nit is no longer able to transfer its writes to the specified number of replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration, the old Redis master M1 in the above example, will become unavailable after 10 seconds.

Redis Functions and Lua scripts:\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### **Redis Functions** (introduced in Redis 7.0)\n- **First-class database artifacts**: Functions are managed as an integral part of the database\n- **Persistent**: Stored alongside data, persisted to AOF, and replicated from master to replicas\n- **Named and versioned**: Each function has a unique user-defined name, making it easier to call and trace\n- **Declared before use**: Applications don't need to load them during runtime\n- **Library-based**: Functions belong to libraries, enabling code sharing between functions\n- **Immutable libraries**: Libraries are updated as a whole, not selectively\n- **No debugger support**: The Lua debugger is not available for functions\n\n### **Lua Scripts** (EVAL/EVALSHA)\n- **Ephemeral**: Considered part of the client application, not the database\n- **Not persistent**: Script cache can be lost after server restart, failover, or SCRIPT FLUSH\n- **Anonymous**: Identified only by SHA1 digest, making debugging harder\n- **Sent on every execution**: EVAL sends the entire script each time (though EVALSHA optimizes this)\n- **Application responsibility**: Apps must reload scripts if missing\n- **No code sharing**: Scripts can't call other scripts\n- **Debugger available**: Full Lua debugger (LDB) support\n\n## When to Use Which?\n\n### **Use Redis Functions when:**\n- You need **persistent, reusable logic** that survives restarts and failovers\n- Building a **logical schema** or consistent data entity views\n- Want to **extend Redis with custom APIs** similar to modules\n- Need **code sharing** between multiple functions in a library\n- Prefer **named functions** for easier debugging and tracing\n- Using Redis as a primary database (not just cache)\n\n### **Use Lua Scripts when:**\n- Implementing **lightweight, application-specific logic**\n- Logic is **tightly coupled to application code** and changes frequently\n- Need the **Lua debugger** for development\n- Using Redis as an **ephemeral cache** where persistence isn't critical\n- Simple one-off operations that don't require code reuse\n\n## Common Ground\n\nBoth approaches share:\n- **Atomic execution**: Block all server activities during execution\n- **Same Lua 5.1 engine** and capabilities\n- **Access to all Redis commands** via `redis.call()` and `redis.pcall()`\n- **Script effects replication** (default since Redis 5.0/7.0)\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md > \"What are Redis Functions?\" + \"Prologue (or,

Redis commands from a Lua script either via [`redis.call()`]() or [`redis.pcall()`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two are nearly identical.\\\\\\\\nBoth execute a Redis command along with its provided arguments, if these represent a well-formed command.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as generic as possible and provide customized execution via their arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA script is loaded to the server\\'s cache by calling the [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() command and providing its source code.\\\\\\\\nThe server doesn\\'t execute the script, but instead just compiles and loads it to the server\\'s cache.\\\\\\\\nOnce loaded, you can execute the cached script with the SHA1 digest returned from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of loading and then executing a cached script:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Immabe a cached

evolutionary step from ephemeral scripting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions provide the same core functionality as scripts but are first-class software artifacts of the database.\\\\\\\\nRedis manages functions as an integral part of the database and ensures their availability via data persistence and replication.\\\\\\\\nBecause functions are part of the database and therefore declared before use, applications aren\\'t required to load them during runtime nor risk aborted transactions.\\\\\\\\nAn application that uses functions depends only on their APIs rather than on the embedded script logic in the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhereas ephemeral scripts are considered a part of the application\\'s domain, functions extend the database server itself with user-provided logic.\\\\\\\\nThey can be used to expose a richer API composed of core Redis commands, similar to modules, developed once, loaded at startup, and used repeatedly by various applications / clients.\\\\\\\\nEvery function has a unique user-defined name, making it much easier to call and trace its execution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe design of Redis Functions also attempts to demarcate between the programming language used for writing functions and their management by the server.\\\\\\\\nLua, the only language interpreter that Redis presently support as an embedded execution engine, is meant to be simple and easy to learn.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the choice of Lua as a language still presents many Redis users with a challenge.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Functions feature makes no assumptions about the implementation\\'s language.\\\\\\\\nAn execution engine that is part of the definition of the function handles running it.\\\\\\\\nAn engine can theoretically execute functions in any language as long as it respects several rules (such as the ability to terminate an executing function).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPresently, as noted above, Redis ships with a single embedded [Lua 5.1]() engine.\\\\\\\\nThere are plans to support additional engines in the future.\\\\\\\\nRedis functions can use all of Lua\\'s available capabilities to ephemeral scripts,\\\\\\\\nwith the only exception being the [Redis Lua scripts debugger]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions also simplify development by enabling code sharing.\\\\\\\\nEvery function belongs to a single library, and any given library can consist of multiple functions.\\\\\\\\nThe library\\'s contents are immutable, and selective updates of its functions aren\\'t allowed.\\\\\\\\nInstead, libraries are updated as a whole with all of their functions together in one operation.\\\\\\\\nThis allows calling functions from other functions within the same library, or sharing code between functions by using a common code in library-internal methods, that can also take language native arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions are intended to better support the use case of maintaining a consistent view for data entities through a logical schema, as mentioned above.\\\\\\\\nAs such, functions are stored alongside the data itself.\\\\\\\\nFunctions are also persisted to the AOF file and replicated from master to replicas, so they are as durable as the data itself.\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis is used as an ephemeral cache, additional mechanisms (described below) are required to make functions more durable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLike all other operations in Redis, the execution of a function is atomic.\\\\\\\\nA function\\'s execution blocks all server activities during its entire time, similarly to the semantics of [transactions]().\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\nThe blocking semantics of an executed function apply to all connected clients at all times.\\\\\\\\nBecause running a function blocks the Redis server, functions are meant to finish executing quickly, so you should avoid using long-running functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n

employ programmatic control structures and use most of the [commands]() while executing to access the database.\\\\\\\\nBecause scripts execute in the server, reading and writing data from scripts is very efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis guarantees the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\nWhile executing the script, all server activities are blocked during its entire runtime.\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripting offers several properties that can be valuable in many cases.\\\\\\\\nThese include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Providing locality by executing logic where data lives. Data locality reduces overall latency and saves networking resources.\\\\\\\\n* Blocking semantics that ensure the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\n* Enabling the composition of simple capabilities that are either missing from Redis or are too niche to be a part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLua lets you run part of your application logic inside Redis.\\\\\\\\nSuch scripts can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine.\\\\\\\\nPresently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference]() page for complete documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough the server executes them, Eval scripts are regarded as a part of the client-side application, which is why they\\'re not named, versioned, or persisted.\\\\\\\\nSo all scripts may need to be reloaded by the application at any time if missing (after a server restart, fail-over to a replica, etc.).\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, [Redis Functions]() offer an alternative approach to programmability which allow the server itself to be extended with additional programmed logic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll start scripting with Redis by using the [`EVAL`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s our first example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello, scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, [`EVAL`]() takes two arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe first argument is a string that consists of the script\\'s Lua source code.\\\\\\\\nThe script doesn\\'t need to include any definitions of Lua function.\\\\\\\\nIt is just a Lua program that will run in the Redis engine\\'s context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second argument is the number of arguments that follow the script\\'s body, starting from the third argument, representing Redis key names.\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we used the value _0_ because we didn\\'t provide the script with any arguments, whether the names of keys or not.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.4927,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with Redis 3.2, it is possible to select an alternative replication method.\\\\\\\\nInstead of replicating whole scripts, we can replicate the write commands generated by the script.\\\\\\\\nWe call this **script effects replication**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:**\\\\\\\\nstarting with Redis 5.0, script effects replication is the default mode and does not need to be explicitly enabled.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this replication mode, while Lua scripts are executed, Redis collects all the commands executed by the Lua scripting engine that actually modify the dataset.\\\\\\\\nWhen the script execution finishes, the sequence of commands that the script generated are wrapped into a [`MULTI`]()/[`EXEC`]() [transaction]() and are sent to the replicas and AOF.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is useful in several ways depending on the use case:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When the script is slow to compute, but the effects can be summarized by a few write commands, it is a shame to re-compute the script on the replicas or when reloading the AOF.\\\\\\\\n  In this case, it is much better to replicate just the effects of the script.\\\\\\\\n* When script effects replication is enabled, the restrictions on non-deterministic functions are removed.\\\\\\\\n  You can, for example, use the [`TIME`]() or [`SRANDMEMBER`]() commands inside your scripts freely at any place.\\\\\\\\n* The Lua PRNG in this mode is seeded randomly on every call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnless already enabled by the server\\'s configuration or defaults (before Redis 7.0), you need to issue the following Lua command before the script performs a write:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.replicate_commands()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`redis.replicate_commands()`]() function returns _true) if script effects replication was enabled;\\\\\\\\notherwise, if the function was called after the script already called a write command,\\\\\\\\nit returns _false_, and normal whole script replication is used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis function is deprecated as of Redis 7.0, and while you can still call it, it will always succeed.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\":

executed on the server. This feature, which became available in Redis 7, supersedes the use of [EVAL]() in prior versions of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior versions of Redis made scripting available only via the [`EVAL`]() command, which allows a Lua script to be sent for execution by the server.\\\\\\\\nThe core use cases for [Eval Scripts]() is executing part of your application logic inside Redis, efficiently and atomically.\\\\\\\\nSuch script can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing [`EVAL`]() requires that the application sends the entire script for execution every time.\\\\\\\\nBecause this results in network and script compilation overheads, Redis provides an optimization in the form of the [`EVALSHA`]() command. By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes

features:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* It uses a server-client model, so it\\'s a remote debugger.\\\\\\\\nThe Redis server acts as the debugging server, while the default client is `redis-cli`. \\\\\\\\nHowever other clients can be developed by following the simple protocol implemented by the server.\\\\\\\\n* By default every new debugging session is a forked session.\\\\\\\\nIt means that while the Redis Lua script is being debugged, the server does not block and is usable for development or in order to execute multiple debugging sessions in parallel.\\\\\\\\nThis also means that changes are **rolled back** after the script debugging session finished, so that\\'s possible to restart a new debugging session again, using exactly the same Redis data set as the previous debugging session.\\\\\\\\n* An alternative synchronous (non forked) debugging model is available on demand, so that changes to the dataset can be retained.\\\\\\\\nIn this mode the server blocks for the time the debugging session is active.\\\\\\\\n* Support for step by step execution.\\\\\\\\n* Support for static and dynamic breakpoints.\\\\\\\\n* Support from logging the debugged script into the debugger console.\\\\\\\\n* Inspection of Lua variables.\\\\\\\\n* Tracing of Redis commands executed by the script.\\\\\\\\n* Pretty printing of Redis and Lua values.\\\\\\\\n* Infinite loops and long execution detection, which simulates a breakpoint.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.3362,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

a given Redis command and returns its reply.\\\\\\\\nIts inputs are the command and arguments, and once called, it executes the command in Redis and returns the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, we can call the [`ECHO`]() command from a script and return its reply like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nreturn redis.call(\\'ECHO\\', \\'Echo, echo... eco... o...\\')\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf and when `redis.call()` triggers a runtime exception, the raw exception is raised back to the user as an error, automatically.\\\\\\\\nTherefore, attempting to execute the following ephemeral script will fail and generate a runtime exception because [`ECHO`]() accepts exactly one argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'ECHO\\', \\'Echo,\\', \\'echo... \\', \\'eco... \\', \\'o...\\')\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n(error) ERR Wrong number of args calling Redis command from script script: b0345693f4b77517a711221050e76d24ae60b7f7, on @user_script:1.\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the call can fail due to various reasons, see [Execution under low memory conditions]() and [Script flags](#script_flags)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo handle Redis runtime errors use `redis.pcall()` instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Since version: 2.6.0\\\\\\\\n* Available in scripts: yes\\\\\\\\n* Available in functions: yes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis function enables handling runtime errors raised by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThe `redis.pcall()` function  behaves exactly like [`redis.call()`](#redis.call), except that it:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Always returns a reply.\\\\\\\\n* Never throws a runtime exception, and returns in its stead a [`redis.error_reply`](#redis.error_reply) in case that a runtime exception is thrown by the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following demonstrates how to use `redis.pcall()` to intercept and handle runtime exceptions from within the context of an ephemeral script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nlocal reply = redis.pcall(\\'ECHO\\', unpack(ARGV))\\\\\\\\nif reply[\\'err\\'] ~= nil then\\\\\\\\n  -- Handle the error sometime, but for now just log it\\\\\\\\n  redis.log(redis.LOG_WARNING, reply[\\'err\\'])\\\\\\\\n  reply[\\'err\\'] = \\'ERR Something is wrong, but no worries, everything is under control\\'\\\\\\\\nend\\\\\\\\nreturn reply\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvaluating this script with more than one argument will return:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"...\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 hello

here's how to benchmark Redis performance:\n\n## Primary Tool: redis-benchmark\n\nRedis includes a built-in utility called `redis-benchmark` that simulates running commands by N clients sending M total queries (similar to Apache's `ab` utility).\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -q -n 100000\n```\n\n### Key Options\n\n- `-h <hostname>` - Server hostname (default 127.0.0.1)\n- `-p <port>` - Server port (default 6379)\n- `-c <clients>` - Number of parallel connections (default 50)\n- `-n <requests>` - Total number of requests (default 100000)\n- `-d <size>` - Data size of SET/GET value in bytes (default 3)\n- `-t <tests>` - Only run specific tests (comma-separated)\n- `-P <numreq>` - Pipeline requests (default 1, no pipeline)\n- `-q` - Quiet mode, just show query/sec values\n- `--threads <num>` - Enable multi-thread mode\n\n### Example: Test Specific Commands\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -t set,lpush -n 100000 -q\n```\n\n### Example: Using Pipelining (Higher Throughput)\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\n```\n\nPipelining can dramatically improve performance (e.g., from ~72K to 1.5M+ requests/sec for SET operations).\n\n##

In Redis the difference\\\\\\\\nbetween such a synthetic benchmark and a real one is not huge since it is an\\\\\\\\nin-memory system, however it is possible to stress cache misses and in general\\\\\\\\nto simulate a more real-world work load by using a large key space.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is obtained by using the `-r` switch. For instance if I want to run\\\\\\\\none million SET operations, using a random key for every operation out of\\\\\\\\n100k possible keys, I\\'ll use the following command line:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli flushall\\\\\\\\n    OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -t set -r 100000 -n 1000000\\\\\\\\n    ====== SET ======\\\\\\\\n      1000000 requests completed in 13.86 seconds\\\\\\\\n      50 parallel clients\\\\\\\\n      3 bytes payload\\\\\\\\n      keep alive: 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    99.76% `<=` 1 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    99.98% `<=` 2 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    72144.87 requests per second\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli dbsize\\\\\\\\n    (integer) 99993\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default every client (the benchmark simulates 50 clients if not otherwise\\\\\\\\nspecified with `-c`) sends the next command only when the reply of the previous\\\\\\\\ncommand is received, this means that the server will likely need a read call\\\\\\\\nin order to read each command from every client. Also RTT is paid as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis supports [pipelining](/topics/pipelining), so it is possible to send\\\\\\\\nmultiple commands at once, a feature often exploited by real world applications.\\\\\\\\nRedis pipelining is able to dramatically improve the number of operations per\\\\\\\\nsecond a server is able to deliver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of running the benchmark in a MacBook Air 11\\\\\\\\\\\\\" using a\\\\\\\\npipelining of 16 commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\\\\\\\\n    SET: 1536098.25 requests per second, p50=0.479 msec                     \\\\\\\\n    GET: 1811594.25 requests per second, p50=0.391 msec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining results in a significant increase in performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPitfalls and misconceptions\\\\\\\\n---------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first point is obvious: the golden rule of a useful benchmark is to\\\\\\\\nonly compare apples and apples. Different versions of Redis can be compared\\\\\\\\non the same workload for instance. Or the same version of Redis, but with\\\\\\\\ndifferent options. If you plan to compare Redis to something else, then it is\\\\\\\\nimportant to evaluate the functional and technical differences, and take them\\\\\\\\nin account.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is a server, hence, all commands involve network round trips. Embedded data stores do not involve network and protocol management. When comparing such products to Redis, command execution times should be used instead of end-to-end times.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis commands return an acknowledgment for all usual commands. Some other data stores do not. Comparing Redis to stores involving one-way queries is only mildly useful.\\\\\\\\n+ Naively iterating on synchronous Redis commands does not benchmark Redis itself, but rather measure your network (or IPC) latency and the client library intrinsic latency. To really test Redis, you need multiple connections (like redis-benchmark) and/or to use pipelining to aggregate several commands and/or multiple threads or processes.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is an in-memory data store with some optional persistence options. If you plan to compare it to transactional servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc ...), then you should consider activating AOF and decide on a suitable fsync policy.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is, mostly, a single-threaded server from the POV of commands execution (actually modern versions of Redis use threads for different things). It is not designed to benefit from multiple CPU cores. People are supposed to launch several Redis instances to scale out on several cores if needed. It is not really fair to compare one single Redis instance to a multi-threaded data store.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA common misconception is that redis-benchmark is designed to make Redis\\\\\\\\nperformances look stellar, the throughput achieved by redis-benchmark being\\\\\\\\nsomewhat artificial, and not achievable by a real application. This is\\\\\\\\nactually not true.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `redis-benchmark` program is a quick and useful way to get some figures and\\\\\\\\nevaluate the performance of a Redis instance on a given hardware. However,\\\\\\\\nby default, it does not represent the maximum throughput a Redis instance can\\\\\\\\nsustain. Actually, by using pipelining and a fast client (hiredis), it is fairly\\\\\\\\neasy to write a program generating more throughput than redis-benchmark. The\\\\\\\\ndefault behavior of redis-benchmark is to achieve throughput by exploiting\\\\\\\\nconcurrency only (i.e. it creates several connections to the server).\\\\\\\\nIt does not use pipelining or any parallelism at all (one pending query per\\\\\\\\nconnection at most, and no multi-threading), if not explicitly enabled via\\\\\\\\nthe `-P` parameter. So in some way using `redis-benchmark` and, triggering, for\\\\\\\\nexample, a `BGSAVE` operation in the background at the same time, will provide\\\\\\\\nthe user with numbers more near to the *worst case* than to the best case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo run a benchmark using pipelining mode (and achieve higher throughput),\\\\\\\\nyou need to explicitly use the -P option. Please note that it is still a\\\\\\\\nrealistic behavior since a lot of Redis based applications actively use\\\\\\\\npipelining to improve performance. However you should use a pipeline size that\\\\\\\\nis more or less the average pipeline length you\\'ll be able to use in your\\\\\\\\napplication in order to get realistic numbers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, the benchmark should apply the same operations, and work in the same way\\\\\\\\nwith the multiple data stores you want to compare. It is absolutely pointless to\\\\\\\\ncompare the result of redis-benchmark to the result of another benchmark\\\\\\\\nprogram and extrapolate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, Redis and memcached in single-threaded mode can be compared on\\\\\\\\nGET/SET operations. Both are in-memory data stores, working mostly in the same\\\\\\\\nway at the protocol level. Provided their respective benchmark application is\\\\\\\\naggregating queries in the same way (pipelining) and use a similar number of\\\\\\\\nconnections, the comparison is actually meaningful.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis perfect example is illustrated by the dialog between Redis (antirez) and\\\\\\\\nmemcached (dormando) developers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 1 - On Redis, Memcached, Speed, Benchmarks and The Toilet](http://antirez.com/post/redis-memcached-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[dormando - Redis VS Memcached (slightly better bench)](http://dormando.livejournal.com/525147.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 2 - An update on the Memcached/Redis benchmark](http://antirez.com/post/update-on-memcached-redis-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can see that in the end, the difference between the two solutions is not\\\\\\\\nso staggering, once all technical aspects are considered. Please note both\\\\\\\\nRedis and memcached have been optimized further after these benchmarks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, when very efficient servers are benchmarked (and stores like Redis\\\\\\\\nor memcached definitely fall in this category), it may be difficult to saturate\\\\\\\\nthe server. Sometimes, the performance bottleneck is on client side,\\\\\\\\nand not server-side. In that case, the client (i.e. the benchmark program itself)\\\\\\\\nmust be fixed, or perhaps scaled out, in order to reach the maximum throughput.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFactors impacting Redis performance\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are multiple factors having direct consequences on Redis performance.\\\\\\\\nWe mention them here, since they can alter the result of any benchmarks.\\\\\\\\nPlease note however, that a typical Redis instance running on a low end,\\\\\\\\nuntuned box usually provides good enough performance for most applications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Network bandwidth and latency usually have a direct impact on the performance.\\\\\\\\nIt is a good practice to use the ping program to quickly check the latency\\\\\\\\nbetween the client and server hosts is normal before launching the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nRegarding the bandwidth, it is generally useful to estimate\\\\\\\\nthe throughput in Gbit/s and compare it to the theoretical bandwidth\\\\\\\\nof the network. For instance a benchmark setting 4 KB strings\\\\\\\\nin Redis at 100000 q/s, would actually consume 3.2 Gbit/s of bandwidth\\\\\\\\nand probably fit within a 10 Gbit/s link, but not a 1 Gbit/s one. In many real\\\\\\\\nworld scenarios, Redis throughput is limited by the network well before being\\\\\\\\nlimited by the CPU. To consolidate several high-throughput Redis instances\\\\\\\\non a single server, it worth considering putting a 10 Gbit/s NIC\\\\\\\\nor multiple 1 Gbit/s NICs with TCP/IP bonding.\\\\\\\\n+ CPU is another very important factor. Being single-threaded, Redis favors\\\\\\\\nfast CPUs with large caches and not many cores. At this game, Intel CPUs are\\\\\\\\ncurrently the winners. It is not uncommon to get only half the performance on\\\\\\\\nan AMD Opteron CPU compared to similar Nehalem EP/Westmere EP/Sandy Bridge\\\\\\\\nIntel CPUs with Redis. When client and server run on the same box, the CPU is\\\\\\\\nthe limiting factor with redis-benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ Speed of RAM and memory bandwidth seem less critical for global performance\\\\\\\\nespecially for small objects. For large objects (>10 KB), it may become\\\\\\\\nnoticeable though. Usually, it is not really cost-effective to buy expensive\\\\\\\\nfast memory modules to optimize Redis.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis runs slower on a VM compared to running without virtualization using\\\\\\\\nthe same hardware. If you have the chance to run Redis on a physical machine\\\\\\\\nthis is preferred. However this does not mean that Redis is slow in\\\\\\\\nvirtualized environments, the delivered performances are still very good\\\\\\\\nand most of the serious performance issues you may incur in virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironments are due to over-provisioning, non-local disks with high latency,\\\\\\\\nor old hypervisor software that have slow `fork` syscall implementation.\\\\\\\\n+ When the server and client benchmark programs run on the same box, both\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback and unix domain sockets can be used. Depending on the\\\\\\\\nplatform, unix domain sockets can achieve around 50% more throughput than\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback (on Linux for instance). The default behavior of\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark is to use the TCP/IP loopback.\\\\\\\\n+ The performance benefit of unix domain sockets compared to TCP/IP loopback\\\\\\\\ntends to decrease when pipelining is heavily used (i.e. long pipelines).\\\\\\\\n+ When an ethernet network is used to access Redis, aggregating commands using\\\\\\\\npipelining is especially efficient when the size of the data is kept under\\\\\\\\nthe ethernet packet size (about 1500 bytes). Actually, processing 10 bytes,\\\\\\\\n100 bytes, or 1000 bytes queries almost result in the same throughput.\\\\\\\\nSee the graph below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Data size impact](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/client_command/topics/Data_size.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ On multi CPU sockets servers, Redis performance becomes dependent on the\\\\\\\\nNUMA configuration and process location. The most visible effect is that\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark results seem non-deterministic because client and server\\\\\\\\nprocesses are distributed randomly on the cores. To get deterministic results,\\\\\\\\nit is required to use process placement tools (on Linux: taskset or numactl).\\\\\\\\nThe most efficient combination is always to put the client and server on two\\\\\\\\ndifferent cores of the same CPU to benefit from the L3 cache.\\\\\\\\nHere are some results of 4 KB SET benchmark for 3 server CPUs (AMD Istanbul,\\\\\\\\nIntel Nehalem EX, and Intel Westmere) with different relative placements.\\\\\\\\nPlease note this benchmark is not meant to compare CPU models between themselves\\\\\\\\n(CPUs exact model and frequency are therefore not disclosed).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![NUMA chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/6374a07f93e867353e5e946c1e39a573dfc83f6c/topics/NUMA_chart.gif)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, the number of client connections is also an\\\\\\\\nimportant factor. Being based on epoll/kqueue, the Redis event loop is quite\\\\\\\\nscalable. Redis has already been benchmarked at more than 60000 connections,\\\\\\\\nand was still able to sustain 50000 q/s in these conditions. As a rule of thumb,\\\\\\\\nan instance with 30000 connections can only process half the throughput\\\\\\\\nachievable with 100 connections. Here is an example showing the throughput of\\\\\\\\na Redis instance per number of connections:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![connections chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/system_info/topics/Connections_chart.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, it is possible to achieve higher throughput by\\\\\\\\ntuning the NIC(s) configuration and associated interruptions. Best throughput\\\\\\\\nis achieved by setting an affinity between Rx/Tx NIC queues and CPU cores,\\\\\\\\nand activating RPS (Receive Packet Steering) support. More information in this\\\\\\\\n[thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/gUhc19gnYgc/BruTPCOroiMJ).\\\\\\\\nJumbo frames may also provide a performance boost when large objects are used.\\\\\\\\n+ Depending on the platform, Redis can be compiled against different memory\\\\\\\\nallocators (libc malloc, jemalloc, tcmalloc), which may have different behaviors\\\\\\\\nin term of raw speed, internal and external fragmentation.\\\\\\\\nIf you did not compile Redis yourself, you can use the INFO command to check\\\\\\\\nthe `mem_allocator` field. Please note most benchmarks do not run long enough to\\\\\\\\ngenerate significant external fragmentation (contrary to production Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOther things to consider\\\\\\\\n------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne important goal of any benchmark is to get reproducible results, so they\\\\\\\\ncan be compared to the results of other tests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ A good practice is to try to run tests on isolated hardware as much as possible.\\\\\\\\nIf it is not possible, then the system must be monitored to check the benchmark\\\\\\\\nis not impacted by some external activity.\\\\\\\\n+ Some configurations (desktops and laptops for sure, some servers as well)\\\\\\\\nhave a variable CPU core frequency mechanism. The policy controlling this\\\\\\\\nmechanism can be set at the OS level. Some CPU models are more aggressive than\\\\\\\\nothers at adapting the frequency of the CPU cores to the workload. To get\\\\\\\\nreproducible results, it is better to set the highest possible fixed frequency\\\\\\\\nfor all the CPU cores involved in the benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ An important point is to size the system accordingly to the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nThe system must have enough RAM and must not swap. On Linux, do not forget\\\\\\\\nto set the `overcommit_memory` parameter correctly. Please note 32 and 64 bit\\\\\\\\nRedis instances do not have the same memory footprint.\\\\\\\\n+ If you plan to use RDB or AOF for your benchmark, please check there is no other\\\\\\\\nI/O activity in the system. Avoid putting RDB or AOF files on NAS or NFS shares,\\\\\\\\nor on any other devices impacting your network bandwidth and/or latency\\\\\\\\n(for instance, EBS on Amazon EC2).\\\\\\\\n+ Set Redis logging level (loglevel parameter) to warning or notice. Avoid putting\\\\\\\\nthe generated log file on a remote filesystem.\\\\\\\\n+ Avoid using monitoring tools which can alter the result of the benchmark. For\\\\\\\\ninstance using INFO at regular interval to gather statistics is probably fine,\\\\\\\\nbut MONITOR will impact the measured performance significantly.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5715,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/arm.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ARM support\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance testing of Redis was performed on the Raspberry Pi 3 and Pi 1 model B.

2000) ** 2 < 100 and .rating / 2 > 4'\n```\n\n## 性能调优\n\n使用 `FILTER-EF` 参数控制引擎检查多少候选节点来找到足够的过滤结果（默认 `COUNT * 100`）：\n\n```bash\nVSIM vset VALUES 3 0 0 0 COUNT 10 FILTER '.year > 2000' FILTER-EF 500\n```\n\n- 对于稀有过滤条件，使用更高的值\n- 使用 `FILTER-EF 0` 扫描所有需要的节点\n- 引擎会在找到足够高质量结果时提前停止\n\n## 支持的数据类型\n\n- 数字\n- 字符串\n- 布尔值（转换为 1 或 0）\n- 数组（用于 `in` 运算符）\n\n如果字段缺失或无效，该元素会被跳过，不会报错。\n\n---\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/filtered-search.md]**", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/vector-database.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": false, "correct_doc": null, "matched_keywords": [], "gate_passed": false, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": false, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/vector-database.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": ["未检索到期望文档 ['filtered-search.md'] (实际: ['/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/vector-database.md', '/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md'])"], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "bace0cda-4b5e-449f-8f4c-113945bf85dd", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "97e2fe4b-ca50-4636-8bd3-e20fdb428db3", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来帮你检索 Redis vector sets 的 filtered search 相关信息。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_4zJHDiyXq6xuwQKCw0EjlT', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis vector sets filtered search tag filter', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_URbbPJV59tjwDfZmPopy7I', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'filtered search|tag filter|vector search filter'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_4zJHDiyXq6xuwQKCw0EjlT', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.2669,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"49a1af21\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"49a1af21-009\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisos 8.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Open Source 8.0.1 (May 2025) > Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- [#13959](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/13959) Vector sets -

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) search\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The KNN algorithm calculates the distance between the query vector and each vector in Redis based on the chosen distance function. It then returns the top K items with the smallest distances to the query vector. These are the most semantically similar items.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow construct a query to do just that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nquery = (\\\\\\\\n    Query(\\'(*)=>[KNN 3 @vector $query_vector AS vector_score]\\')\\\\\\\\n     .sort_by(\\'vector_score\\')\\\\\\\\n     .return_fields(\\'vector_score\\', \\'id\\', \\'brand\\', \\'model\\', \\'description\\')\\\\\\\\n     .dialect(2)\\\\\\\\n)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s break down the above query template:\\\\\\\\n- The filter expression `(*)` means `all`. In other words, no filtering was applied. You could replace it with an expression that filters by additional metadata.\\\\\\\\n- The `KNN` part of the query searches for the top 3 nearest neighbors.\\\\\\\\n- The query vector must be passed in as the param `query_vector`.\\\\\\\\n- The distance to the query vector is returned as `vector_score`.\\\\\\\\n- The results are sorted by this `vector_score`.\\\\\\\\n- Finally, it returns the fields `vector_score`,  `id`, `brand`, `model`, and `description` for each result.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo utilize a vector query with the [`FT.SEARCH`]() command, you must specify DIALECT 2 or greater.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou must pass the vectorized query as a byte array with the param name `query_vector`. The following code creates a Python NumPy array from the query vector and converts it into a compact, byte-level representation that can be passed as a parameter to the query:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nfor i, encoded_query in enumerate(encoded_queries):\\\\\\\\n    result = client.ft(\\'idx:bikes_vss\\').search(\\\\\\\\n        query,\\\\\\\\n        {\\\\\\\\n          \\'query_vector\\': np.array(encoded_query, dtype=np.float32).tobytes()\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\\\\\n    )\\\\\\\\n    print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Results for query \\'{queries[i]}\\':\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n    for doc in result.docs:\\\\\\\\n        print(f\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t{doc.id}: {doc.brand} {doc.model}\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the template for the query in place, you can execute all queries in a loop.

This update also includes highly-requested support for indexing empty and missing values and enhances the developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities. Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax easier. Lastly, Geospatial search capabilities have been expanded with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, and ergonomics have been improved by providing better reporting of the memory consumed by the index and exposing the full-text scoring in an aggregation pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFeatures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Enhancing exact matching queries with `TAG` avoiding escaping special meaning characters using the [simpler syntax](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/query/exact-match/#tag-field) `\\'@tag:{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"my-query%term\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\\'` and `NUMERIC` queries:\\\\\\\\n  - [#4802](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4802) - Using double quotes to wrap exact matching query terms such as `@email:{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"test@redis.com\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}` in `DIALECT 2` ( MOD-7299)\\\\\\\\n  - [#4676](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4676), [#4433](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4433) - Enhancing query parser to avoid unnecessary escaping (MOD-5756)\\\\\\\\n  - [#4527](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4527) - Enhancing exact matching queries for `NUMERIC` using single value `FT.SEARCH idx @numeric:[3456]` (MOD-6623)\\\\\\\\n  - [#4802](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4802) - Enabling support for single operators in `NUMERIC` queries such as equivalence `==`, difference `!=`, greater than `>` and `>=` and less than `<` and `<=` as in `FT.SEARCH idx \\'@numeric==3456\\'` (MOD-6749)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Adding new keywords to support indexing empty values using `INDEXEMPTY` and missing values using `INDEXMISSING` per field in the `SCHEMA` while defining the [index](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/ft.create/) with `FT.CREATE`\\\\\\\\n  - [#4663](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4663), [#4721](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4721) - Indexing empty strings values `\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` for `TAG` and `TEXT` fields (MOD-6540, MOD-7200)\\\\\\\\n  - [#4721](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4721) - Updating the query parser to support empty value queries for `TEXT` as `FT.SEARCH idx \\'@text_field:\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\'`or `FT.SEARCH idx \\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\'` and for `TAG` as in `FT.SEARCH idx \\'@tag_field:{\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\\'` (MOD-7200)\\\\\\\\n  - [#4720](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4720), [#4635](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4635) - Indexing missing values for all field types introducing the query syntax function `ismissing(@field)` enabling query for missing fields as in `FT.SEARCH idx \\'ismissing(@text)\\'` (MOD-6532)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Enabling new vector data types reducing memory consumed by vectors with the new `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16`\\\\\\\\n  - [#4674](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/4674) - Adding support `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` in the [vector index definition](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/vectors/#creation-attributes-per-algorithm) (MOD-6765, MOD-6776)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Exposing the full-text score values during the aggregation pipeline using `ADDSCORE`.

The implementation requires no external API dependencies.\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\nInstall the required tools:\n- **Ollama**: Download from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/download)\n- **Qdrant**: Vector database for storing embeddings\n- **Python 3.8+**\n\n### 2. Install Qdrant (Docker)\n```bash\ndocker pull qdrant/qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\n### 3. Pull Llama Models\n```bash\nollama pull llama3.2\nollama pull openhermes  # For embeddings\n```\n\n### 4. Clone and Install Dependencies\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 5. Run the Application\n```bash\npython local_rag_agent.py\n```\n\nAccess the web interface at `http://localhost:7777` through the AgentOS interface.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Fully local implementation** - No external API calls\n- **Powered by Llama 3.2** via Ollama\n- **Vector search** using Qdrant\n- **Interactive web interface** with AgentOS\n- **Built with Agno v2.0** Knowledge class for document management\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Documents (e.g., PDFs) are loaded into the knowledge base on first run\n2. Content is chunked and embedded using OpenHermes embedder\n3. Embeddings are stored in Qdrant vector database\n4. User queries are embedded and searched against the knowledge base\n5. Llama 3.2 generates answers based on retrieved context\n\n## Note\n\nAfter the first run, you can comment out the `knowledge_base.add_content()` line to avoid reloading documents.\n\n---\n\n**[来源:

It allows for storage of vector embeddings and facilitates fast similarity searches, crucial for retrieving relevant information in RAG.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Popular AI frameworks**: Redis integrates seamlessly with various AI frameworks and tools. For instance, combining Redis with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) or [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/RedisIndexDemo/), libraries for building language models, enables developers to create sophisticated RAG pipelines. These integrations support efficient data management and building real-time LLM chains.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Spring AI and Redis**: Using [Spring AI with Redis](https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/) simplifies building RAG applications. Spring AI provides a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into applications, while Redis handles data management, ensuring the RAG pipeline is efficient and scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Embed and store data**: Convert your data into vector embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., BERT, GPT). Store these embeddings in Redis, where they can be quickly retrieved based on vector searches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Integrate with a generative model**: Use a generative AI model that can leverage the retrieved data. The model will use the vectors stored in Redis to augment its generation process, ensuring the output is informed by relevant, up-to-date information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Query and generate**: Implement the query logic to retrieve relevant vectors from Redis based on the input prompt. Feed these vectors into the generative model to produce augmented outputs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency**: The in-memory data store of Redis ensures that retrieval operations are performed with minimal latency.\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability**: Redis scales horizontally, seamlessly handling growing volumes of data and queries.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures and integrates with AI frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, Redis offers a powerful and efficient platform for implementing RAG. Its vector management capabilities, high performance, and seamless integration with AI frameworks make it an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI applications with real-time data retrieval.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5305,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"279a93cc\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"279a93cc-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_pdf/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Readme\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"📄 Chat with PDF > Interactive Application Demo\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**👉 [Click here to follow our complete step-by-step tutorial](https://www.theunwindai.com/p/build-an-llm-app-with-rag-using-llama-3-2-running-locally) and learn how to build this from scratch with detailed code walkthroughs, explanations, and best practices.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLLM app with RAG to chat with PDF in just 30 lines of Python Code.

Unlike traditional RAG systems that simply retrieve and generate, Corrective RAG adds quality control and fallback mechanisms.\n\n## How It Improves Retrieval Quality\n\nCorrective RAG enhances retrieval quality through several key mechanisms:\n\n1. **Document Relevance Grading**: Uses an LLM (like Claude 4.5 Sonnet) to assess whether retrieved documents are actually relevant to the query, rather than blindly using all retrieved results.\n\n2. **Query Transformation**: When initial retrieval results are insufficient, the system optimizes and reformulates the query to improve search results.\n\n3. **Web Search Fallback**: If local documents aren't sufficient or relevant enough, the system automatically falls back to web search (using tools like Tavily API) to find additional information.\n\n4. **Multi-Stage Workflow**: Implements a structured pipeline using LangGraph that combines:\n   - Smart document retrieval (using vector stores like Qdrant)\n   - Relevance assessment\n   - Query optimization when needed\n   - External search when necessary\n\n5. **Multi-Model Approach**: Combines different models for different tasks (e.g., OpenAI embeddings for retrieval, Claude for analysis and generation), leveraging each model's strengths.\n\nThis corrective approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves answer accuracy by ensuring that only relevant information is used and that the system can adapt when initial retrieval fails.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md > 🔄 Corrective RAG Agent]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/design-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/rag.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md"], "contexts_count": 1, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RAG", "local", "corrective", "retrieval"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/design-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/rag.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "d0b0a403-18b7-4771-bdcf-8f73112042d9", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "311b108e-a657-409d-95a7-15c8e35ce3f1", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Corrective RAG and how it improves retrieval quality.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_I0UVglXYJDmFZUCfJjMC7k', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Corrective RAG retrieval quality improvement', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_I0UVglXYJDmFZUCfJjMC7k', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.6467,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"737a4dbf\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"737a4dbf-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"🔄 Corrective RAG Agent\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🔄 Corrective RAG Agent\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that implements a corrective multi-stage workflow using LangGraph.

Basic Setup\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_pdf\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 2. Core Components\n\n**Document Processing:**\n- Upload PDF documents through the interface\n- Split documents into chunks using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n- Generate embeddings for each chunk\n- Store embeddings in a vector database (Qdrant, PostgreSQL with pgvector, or SQLite)\n\n**Query Processing:**\n- Convert user questions to embeddings\n- Retrieve similar document chunks using similarity search\n- Generate context-aware responses using the LLM\n\n### 3. Architecture Options\n\n**Option A: Cloud-based (OpenAI + Qdrant)**\n- Use OpenAI API for embeddings and LLM\n- Qdrant Cloud for vector storage\n- Supports text-to-speech for voice responses\n\n**Option B: Local RAG with Hybrid Search**\n- Run local LLMs (e.g., Llama models with Q4_K_M quantization)\n- BGE-M3 embedder with 1024 dimensions\n- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching\n- Requires sufficient RAM and CPU/GPU resources\n\n**Option C: Autonomous RAG**\n- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension\n- Web search fallback using DuckDuckGo\n- Persistent storage of conversations\n\n### 4. Key Features to Implement\n\n- PDF upload and processing\n- Automatic text chunking and embedding\n- Vector similarity search\n- Context-aware answer generation\n- Source attribution (show which PDF sections were used)\n- Fallback to general knowledge when document doesn't contain answer\n\n### 5. Running the App\n\n```bash\nstreamlit run chat_pdf.py\n```\n\n## Advanced Enhancements\n\n- **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic search with keyword matching + reranking (using Cohere)\n- **Voice Interface**: Add text-to-speech for audio responses\n- **Multi-document Support**: Track and query across multiple PDFs\n- **Query Rewriting**: Reformulate questions for better retrieval\n\n[来源:

Retrieval Stage (Finding Relevant Images)**\n- Images and PDF pages are converted to base64 strings\n- A multimodal embedding model (like Cohere Embed-4) generates vector embeddings for each image\n- When you ask a text question, it's embedded using the same model\n- Cosine similarity finds the most semantically relevant image to your question\n\n**2. Generation Stage (Answering Questions)**\n- The retrieved image and your text question are sent to a vision-language model (like Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)\n- The model analyzes the visual content and generates a context-aware answer\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **No OCR Required**: Directly processes complex visual elements without text extraction\n- **Multimodal Search**: Semantic matching between text queries and image content\n- **PDF Support**: Automatically extracts PDF pages as images for analysis\n- **Flexible Sources**: Works with uploaded images (PNG, JPG, JPEG) or PDF documents\n\n### Implementation Stack\n\n- **Embedding Model**: Cohere Embed-4 (multimodal embeddings)\n- **Vision-Language Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash\n- **Similarity Search**: Cosine similarity between query and image embeddings\n- **UI**: Streamlit for interactive interface\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Analyze financial charts and extract trends\n- Answer questions about diagrams, flowcharts, or infographics\n- Extract information from tables in screenshots or PDFs\n- Build visual knowledge bases queryable with natural language\n- Understand complex multi-page visual documents\n\n[来源:

\\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Vision RAG with Cohere Embed-4 🖼️ > How It Works\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- **Multimodal Search**: Leverages Cohere Embed-4 to find the most semantically relevant image (or PDF page image) for a given text question.\\\\\\\\n- **Visual Question Answering**: Employs Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to analyze the content of the retrieved image/page and generate accurate, context-aware answers.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexible Content Sources**: \\\\\\\\n    - Use pre-loaded sample financial charts and infographics.\\\\\\\\n    - Upload your own custom images (PNG, JPG, JPEG).\\\\\\\\n    - **Upload PDF documents**: Automatically extracts pages as images for analysis.\\\\\\\\n- **No OCR Required**: Directly processes complex images and visual elements within PDF pages without needing separate text extraction steps.\\\\\\\\n- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction, including content loading, question input, and result display.\\\\\\\\n- **Session Management**: Remembers loaded/uploaded content (images and processed PDF pages) within a session.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Python 3.8+\\\\\\\\n- Cohere API key\\\\\\\\n- Google Gemini API key\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow these steps to set up and run the application:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Clone and Navigate to Directory** :\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\\\\\\\\n    cd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/vision_rag\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Install Dependencies**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n    *(Ensure you have the latest `PyMuPDF` installed along with other requirements)*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3.  **Set up your API keys**:\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Cohere API key from: [https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Google API key from: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4.  **Run the Streamlit app**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    streamlit run vision_rag.py\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5.  **Access the Web Interface**:\\\\\\\\n    - Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your terminal.\\\\\\\\n    - Open this URL in your web browser.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe application follows a two-stage RAG process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Retrieval**: \\\\\\\\n    - When you load sample images or upload your own images/PDFs:\\\\\\\\n        - Regular images are converted to base64 strings.\\\\\\\\n        - **PDFs are processed page by page**: Each page is rendered as an image, saved temporarily, and converted to a base64 string.\\\\\\\\n    - Cohere\\'s `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_document\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`) is used to generate a dense vector embedding for each image or PDF page image.\\\\\\\\n    - When you ask a question, the text query is embedded using the same `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_query\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`).\\\\\\\\n    - Cosine similarity is calculated between the question embedding and all image embeddings.\\\\\\\\n    - The image with the highest similarity score (which could be a regular image or a specific PDF page image) is retrieved as the most relevant context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Generation**:\\\\\\\\n    - The original text question and the retrieved image/page image are passed as input to the Google `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model.\\\\\\\\n    - Gemini analyzes the image content in the context of the question and generates a textual answer.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\":

For example:\n   - **LangChain + Redis**: Use the [Redis vector store integration](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) to create RAG pipelines\n   - **LangChain + Qdrant**: Combine LangChain with Qdrant for document storage and retrieval\n\n3. **Embed and Store Data**: \n   - Convert your documents into vector embeddings using models like BERT or GPT\n   - Store embeddings in your vector database for quick retrieval\n   - Use document loaders like `WebBaseLoader` to ingest content\n   - Split documents using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`\n\n4. **Integrate with a Generative Model**: \n   - Connect a language model (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) that can leverage retrieved data\n   - The model uses vectors from the database to augment its generation process\n\n5. **Query and Generate**: \n   - Implement query logic to retrieve relevant vectors based on input prompts\n   - Feed retrieved context into the generative model to produce augmented outputs\n\n### Advanced Patterns\n\n**Agentic RAG with LangGraph**: For more sophisticated workflows, use LangGraph to orchestrate:\n- Document retrieval from vector databases\n- Relevance assessment of retrieved documents\n- Query refinement for better results\n- Fallback mechanisms (e.g., web search when no relevant docs found)\n\n**Database Routing**: Use LangChain with intelligent routing to query multiple specialized databases and automatically select the most relevant source.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/rag.md > Benefits of Using Redis for

application with Redis, follow these general steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Set up Redis**: Start by setting up a Redis instance and configuring it to handle vector data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Use a Framework**:\\\\\\\\n    1. **Redis Vector Library (RedisVL)**: [RedisVL](https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redisvl/) enhances the development of generative AI applications by efficiently managing vectors and metadata. It allows for storage of vector embeddings and facilitates fast similarity searches, crucial for retrieving relevant information in RAG.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Popular AI frameworks**: Redis integrates seamlessly with various AI frameworks and tools. For instance, combining Redis with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) or [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/RedisIndexDemo/), libraries for building language models, enables developers to create sophisticated RAG pipelines. These integrations support efficient data management and building real-time LLM chains.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Spring AI and Redis**: Using [Spring AI with Redis](https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/) simplifies building RAG applications. Spring AI provides a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into applications, while Redis handles data management, ensuring the RAG pipeline is efficient and scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Embed and store data**: Convert your data into vector embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., BERT, GPT). Store these embeddings in Redis, where they can be quickly retrieved based on vector searches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Integrate with a generative model**: Use a generative AI model that can leverage the retrieved data. The model will use the vectors stored in Redis to augment its generation process, ensuring the output is informed by relevant, up-to-date information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Query and generate**: Implement the query logic to retrieve relevant vectors from Redis based on the input prompt. Feed these vectors into the generative model to produce augmented outputs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency**: The in-memory data store of Redis ensures that retrieval operations are performed with minimal latency.\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability**: Redis scales horizontally, seamlessly handling growing volumes of data and queries.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures and integrates with AI frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, Redis offers a powerful and efficient platform for implementing RAG.

There are two main approaches available:\n\n## 1. Basic Chat with Research Papers\n\n**Features:**\n- Engage in conversational interactions with arXiv\n- Access and explore a vast collection of research papers\n- Utilize OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent responses\n\n**Setup Steps:**\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_research_papers\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Run the app\nstreamlit run chat_arxiv.py\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- OpenAI API key (sign up at platform.openai.com)\n\n## 2. Advanced AI Research Agent with Memory\n\nFor a more sophisticated solution, you can build an agent that maintains memory of user interests and past interactions:\n\n**Features:**\n- Search interface for querying arXiv papers\n- AI-powered processing of search results for improved readability\n- Persistent memory of user interests and past searches\n- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model\n- Implements memory storage using Mem0 and Qdrant\n\n**Setup Steps:**\n\n```bash\n# Clone and navigate\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/ai_arxiv_agent_memory\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Start Qdrant (for memory storage)\ndocker pull qdrant/qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \\\n    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \\\n    qdrant/qdrant\n\n# Run the app\nstreamlit run ai_arxiv_agent_memory.py\n```\n\n**Key Components:**\n- MultiOn for web browsing\n- Mem0 + Qdrant for maintaining user context\n- Qdrant running on localhost:6333\n\n[来源:

This creates a more natural, interactive experience where users see the AI's response appear progressively, similar to how a human types.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- **Real-time streaming**: Responses appear incrementally as the AI generates them\n- **Live state management**: Conversation history and state update in real-time\n- **Event-driven architecture**: Clean separation between API, events, and streaming responses\n- **Status tracking**: Messages transition through states like `created` → `streaming` → `completed`\n\n## How to Build One\n\n### Architecture (3 Core Components)\n\n```\nstreaming-ai-chatbot/\n├── steps/\n│   ├── conversation.stream.ts    # Real-time conversation state\n│   ├── chat-api.step.ts         # Simple chat API endpoint  \n│   └── ai-response.step.ts      # Streaming AI response handler\n```\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n**1. Enable OpenAI Streaming API**\n\n```typescript\nconst stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',\n  messages: [...],\n  stream: true, // Enable streaming\n})\n\nfor await (const chunk of stream) {\n  // Update state with each token\n  await streams.conversation.set(conversationId, messageId, {\n    message: fullResponse,\n    status: 'streaming',\n    // ...\n  })\n}\n```\n\n**2. Define Conversation State Schema**\n\n```typescript\nexport const config: StateStreamConfig = {\n  name: 'conversation',\n  schema: z.object({\n    message: z.string(),\n    from: z.enum(['user', 'assistant']),\n    status: z.enum(['created', 'streaming', 'completed']),\n    timestamp: z.string(),\n  }),\n  baseConfig: { storageType: 'state' },\n}\n```\n\n**3. Set Up Event-Driven Flow**\n\n```typescript\n// API emits event\nawait emit({\n  topic: 'chat-message',\n  data: { message, conversationId, assistantMessageId },\n})\n\n// Event handler subscribes and processes\nexport const config: EventConfig = {\n  subscribes: ['chat-message'],\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### API Usage\n\n**Request:**\n```json\nPOST /chat\n{\n  \"message\": \"Hello, how are you?\",\n  \"conversationId\": \"optional-conversation-id\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response (updates in real-time):**\n```json\n{\n  \"conversationId\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"message\": \"Message received, AI is responding...\",\n  \"status\": \"streaming\"\n}\n```\n\nStatus transitions:\n- `created`: Initial message state\n- `streaming`: AI is generating the response (updates in real-time)\n- `completed`: Response is complete with full message\n\n### Setup\n\n```bash\n# Clone repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_llm_apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/streaming_ai_chatbot\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Configure OpenAI API key\ncp .env.example .env\n# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n# Start development server\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nNavigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the chatbot.\n\n---\n\n[来源:

There's a detailed example of an AI chess agent in the knowledge base.\n\n## How the AI Chess Agent is Built\n\nThe chess agent uses a **multi-agent architecture** with three specialized agents:\n\n**Agent Architecture:**\n- **Player White**: OpenAI-powered strategic decision maker\n- **Player Black**: OpenAI-powered tactical opponent  \n- **Board Proxy**: Validation agent that ensures move legality and maintains game state\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **Move Validation System**\n   - Robust move verification\n   - Illegal move prevention\n   - Real-time board state monitoring\n   - Secure game progression control\n\n2. **AI Decision Making**\n   - AI-powered position evaluation\n   - Deep tactical analysis\n   - Dynamic strategy adaptation\n   - Complete chess ruleset implementation\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- **Framework**: Autogen (for multi-agent orchestration)\n- **LLM**: OpenAI models for both players\n- **UI**: Streamlit for the web interface\n- **Language**: Python\n\n**How It Works:**\nThe system coordinates two AI agents in a turn-based game where each agent analyzes the board position, evaluates possible moves, and makes strategic decisions. The Board Proxy agent acts as a referee, validating all moves against chess rules and maintaining the authoritative game state.\n\n[来源:

Agent Tools\n\nThe main tool used is **ScrapeGraph AI**, which comes in two versions:\n\n### 1. **Local Library Version** (`scrapegraphai`)\n- Uses natural language prompts to extract structured data\n- Requires OpenAI API key for LLM processing\n- Supports models: GPT-4o, GPT-5, or local models\n- Runs entirely on your local machine\n\n### 2. **Cloud SDK Version** (ScrapeGraph AI API)\nProvides multiple specialized tools:\n\n- **SmartScraper**: Extract structured data using natural language prompts\n  ```python\n  client.smartscraper(\n      website_url=\"https://example.com\",\n      user_prompt=\"Extract all products with prices\"\n  )\n  ```\n\n- **SearchScraper**: AI-powered web search with structured results\n\n- **SmartCrawler**: Intelligently crawl multiple pages (up to 50+ pages)\n\n- **Markdownify**: Convert webpages to clean markdown format\n\n### 3. **MCP Integration** (Firecrawl)\nFor Google ADK framework, agents can use Firecrawl MCP server with tools:\n- `firecrawl_scrape`: Extract clean content in Markdown\n- `firecrawl_batch_scrape`: Parallel processing of multiple URLs\n- `firecrawl_map`: Discover all URLs on a site\n- `firecrawl_search`: Search and extract from recent content\n- `firecrawl_extract`: Structured data extraction with custom schemas\n- `firecrawl_deep_research`: Multi-source analysis\n- `firecrawl_crawl`: Deep crawling with filtering\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/web_scrapping_ai_agent/README.md > 🕷️ Web Scraping AI Agent]\n\n[来源:

Here's how to do it:\n\n## Fine-tuning Llama 3.2 for a Specific Task\n\nThe knowledge base contains a complete tutorial for fine-tuning Llama 3.2 using the **Unsloth library**, which makes the process fast and efficient. You can run this for free in Google Colab.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- Uses **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** for efficient fine-tuning\n- Works with Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models\n- Trains on the FineTome-100k dataset (customizable)\n- Optimized for Google Colab's free tier with GPU access\n\n### Quick Start\n\n1. **Installation**:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n2. **Run the fine-tuning script**:\n```bash\npython finetune_llama3.2.py\n```\n\n3. The fine-tuned model will be saved in the `finetuned_model` directory.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Model Loading**: Loads Llama 3.2 3B Instruct using Unsloth's FastLanguageModel\n2. **LoRA Setup**: Applies Low-Rank Adaptation to specific layers for efficient fine-tuning\n3. **Data Preparation**: Loads and preprocesses the FineTome-100k dataset using a chat template\n4. **Training**: Uses SFTTrainer with configurable training arguments\n5. **Saving**: Saves the fine-tuned model to disk\n\n### Customization Options\n\nYou can modify these parameters in the script:\n- `model_name`: Switch to `\"unsloth/Llama-3.1-1B-Instruct\"` for the 1B model\n- `max_seq_length`: Adjust maximum sequence length\n- `r`: LoRA rank parameter\n- Training hyperparameters in `TrainingArguments`\n- `target_modules`: Choose which layers to fine-tune\n- Dataset: Replace `load_dataset` call with your custom dataset\n- Chat template: Modify `get_chat_template` for different conversational formats\n\n### For Google Colab\n\n1. Open a new Colab notebook\n2. Install dependencies:\n```bash\n!pip install torch transformers datasets trl unsloth\n```\n3. Copy the entire script into a code cell and run\n\n**Note**: The fine-tuning process may take time depending on model size and available computational resources. Ensure you have enough storage space for the fine-tuned model.\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning/README.md > Notes]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/agentic_rag_embedding_gemma/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/ai_reasoning_agent/README.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["fine-tune", "Llama", "training", "RAG"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "Grep"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/agentic_rag_embedding_gemma/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/ai_reasoning_agent/README.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "db791efc-cc2c-405f-8394-b02bedabb8eb", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "f8531bd0-ebca-4d42-9efb-2a554c19a31f", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about fine-tuning Llama 3.2.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_ITvFnXEr9d5UdzmxcIwMP4', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'fine-tune Llama 3.2 for specific task', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_jmeLzH3yyaa1zwexMc3ahT', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs/', 'pattern': 'Llama 3\\\\.2|fine-tun(e|ing)'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_ITvFnXEr9d5UdzmxcIwMP4', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.0967,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4b0a5b7b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4b0a5b7b-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_finetuning_tutorials/llama3.2_finetuning/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Run the entire script\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"1.

The recommended approach uses **Qdrant vector store** combined with memory management libraries like **Mem0**.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Set Up Qdrant Vector Database\n\n```bash\n# Pull and run Qdrant\ndocker pull qdrant/qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \\\n    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \\\n    qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\n### 2. Install Required Dependencies\n\n```bash\npip install mem0 qdrant-client openai streamlit\n```\n\n### 3. Configure Memory Storage\n\nThe application should:\n- Use Qdrant running on `localhost:6333`\n- Implement user-specific conversation history\n- Store and retrieve memory for contextual responses\n\n### 4. Key Features to Implement\n\n- **Persistent storage**: Conversation history survives application restarts\n- **User-specific memory**: Each user has their own memory space\n- **Memory retrieval**: Fetch relevant context before generating responses\n- **Conversation history viewing**: Allow users to see past interactions\n\n## Architecture Patterns\n\nThe knowledge base shows several implementation examples:\n\n1. **Single LLM with Memory**: Basic persistent memory for one model\n2. **Multi-LLM with Shared Memory**: Multiple models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) sharing the same memory layer\n3. **Local Implementation**: Fully local using Llama 3.1 + Ollama with Nomic embeddings\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\n- AI Travel Agent with memory of user preferences\n- ChatGPT clone with personalized memory\n- ArXiv research assistant remembering past queries\n- Multi-model applications with consistent context\n\n[来源:

Here's how to build an AI teaching agent team for education:\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nBuild a **multi-agent system with specialized teaching roles**, where each agent acts as a specialized educator working together to create a complete educational experience.\n\n## Specialized Agent Roles\n\nThe teaching agent team should include:\n\n1. **Curriculum Designer** - Designs the overall learning structure and objectives\n2. **Learning Path Expert** - Creates personalized learning pathways for students\n3. **Resource Librarian** - Curates and manages educational resources\n4. **Practice Instructor** - Develops exercises and assessments\n5. **Team Lead/Coordinator** - Orchestrates collaboration between all agents\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Collaborative workflow**: Agents work together like a professional teaching faculty\n- **Document-based output**: Results can be delivered through platforms like Google Docs\n- **Specialized expertise**: Each agent focuses on their domain (curriculum, resources, practice, etc.)\n- **Coordinated execution**: Team lead ensures comprehensive educational experience\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nThe system uses **multi-agent orchestration** patterns:\n- Agents-as-tools pattern for specialized tasks\n- Parallel execution for efficiency\n- Coordinated mode for comprehensive planning\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Clone the repository with the teaching agent team example\n2. Install dependencies (typically includes OpenAI SDK, Streamlit, etc.)\n3. Set up API keys (OpenAI or your preferred LLM provider)\n4. Run the application through a web interface\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Define clear roles and responsibilities for each agent\n- Use a coordinator agent to manage handoffs between specialists\n- Implement proper delegation patterns for task routing\n- Consider using persistent storage (like SQLite) to track interactions\n\n[来源:

It depicts the potential of Agno as a team of collaborative agents working together seamlessly in order to address a real-world challenge - analyzing speech presentations by users and providing them with comprehensive evaluation and feedback to improve their public speaking skills. Each individual agent has a clear cut goal to follow and together they coordinate as a team to solve a complex multimodal problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- This project has a huge potential for further enhancements. It could be a starting point for a more comprehensive and useful agentic systsem. Some of the proposed additional functionalities could be:\\\\\\\\n  1. Incorporating real-time video recording and conversational capabilities through different role scenarios.\\\\\\\\n  2. Playing back the user speech through an AI avatar to help users learn and understand best speaking practices.\\\\\\\\n  3. Keeping a record of user sessions.\\\\\\\\n  4. Including a performance dashboard to track user performance over time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Each of these additional functionalities could be added by implementing specific goal-oriented agents in the system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Together API** with **meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free** as LLM has a small token limit, therefore, it works with small video clips (15-30 seconds).\\\\\\\\n- Use other LLM options for longer video clips.

The knowledge base contains several implementations using different frameworks.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Multi-Agent Architecture\n\nMost multimodal systems use specialized agents working together:\n\n- **Vision Agent**: Processes images/video using models like Gemini 2.0 Flash\n- **Analysis Agent**: Performs domain-specific analysis (coding, design, content)\n- **Execution/Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates workflow and generates final output\n\n### 2. Technology Stack\n\n**AI Models:**\n- Google Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash or Pro (multimodal capabilities)\n- OpenAI o3-mini (for reasoning tasks)\n\n**Frameworks:**\n- **Phidata**: Agent orchestration\n- **Google ADK**: Multi-agent coordination patterns\n- **Agno**: Collaborative agent platform\n\n**Supporting Tools:**\n- DuckDuckGo Search API (web research)\n- E2B Sandbox (code execution)\n- Streamlit (UI)\n\n### 3. Implementation Steps\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/multimodal_design_agent_team\n\n# 2. Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# 3. Get API keys\n# - Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n# - OpenAI (if needed): https://platform.openai.com/\n\n# 4. Set environment variables\nexport GOOGLE_API_KEY=\"your_api_key\"\n\n# 5. Run application\nstreamlit run design_agent_team.py\n```\n\n### 4. Design Patterns\n\n**Coordinator/Dispatcher Pattern:**\n- Central coordinator routes tasks to specialized agents\n- Each agent has a specific role (visual analysis, UX evaluation, market research)\n- Results are aggregated for comprehensive output\n\n**Sequential Pipeline:**\n- Agents process information in stages\n- Output from one agent feeds into the next\n- Enables iterative refinement\n\n### 5. Best Practices\n\n- Upload high-resolution images for better analysis\n- Provide context about your use case/target audience\n- Use multiple specialized agents rather than one general-purpose agent\n- Implement sandboxed execution for code generation\n- Add timeout protection (e.g., 30-second execution limits)\n- Support iterative refinement based on feedback\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\n- **Design Analysis**: UI/UX feedback, visual hierarchy evaluation\n- **Coding Assistant**: Image-to-code, problem solving with execution\n- **Content Analysis**: Speech evaluation, presentation feedback\n- **Creative Tools**: Home renovation planning, landing page generation\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/multimodal_design_agent_team/README.md > Multimodal AI

It depicts the potential of Agno as a team of collaborative agents working together seamlessly in order to address a real-world challenge - analyzing speech presentations by users and providing them with comprehensive evaluation and feedback to improve their public speaking skills. Each individual agent has a clear cut goal to follow and together they coordinate as a team to solve a complex multimodal problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- This project has a huge potential for further enhancements. It could be a starting point for a more comprehensive and useful agentic systsem. Some of the proposed additional functionalities could be:\\\\\\\\n  1. Incorporating real-time video recording and conversational capabilities through different role scenarios.\\\\\\\\n  2. Playing back the user speech through an AI avatar to help users learn and understand best speaking practices.\\\\\\\\n  3. Keeping a record of user sessions.\\\\\\\\n  4. Including a performance dashboard to track user performance over time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Each of these additional functionalities could be added by implementing specific goal-oriented agents in the system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Together API** with **meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free** as LLM has a small token limit, therefore, it works with small video clips (15-30 seconds).\\\\\\\\n- Use other LLM options for longer video clips.

Approach: Multi-Agent Recruitment System\n\nFor a more comprehensive solution, you could build a multi-agent system with specialized agents:\n- **Technical Recruiter Agent** – Analyzes resumes and evaluates technical skills\n- **Communication Agent** – Handles professional correspondence\n- **Scheduling Coordinator Agent** – Manages interview scheduling\n\nThis approach provides end-to-end recruitment automation beyond just matching.\n\n---\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/resume_job_matcher/README.md > 📄 Resume & Job Matcher > ⚡ Setup

写操作会自动路由到新 master\n```\n\n### 2. 手动重连\n\n如果客户端不支持 Sentinel，需要：\n- 监听 Sentinel 的 `+switch-master` 事件\n- 手动重建连接到新 master\n\n### 3. 临时禁用只读模式（不推荐）\n\n```bash\n# 仅用于紧急恢复，会导致数据不一致\nredis-cli CONFIG SET replica-read-only no\n```\n\n⚠️ **不推荐**：这会导致主从数据不一致，仅用于紧急情况。\n\n## 验证\n\n检查 Sentinel 日志确认切换事件：\n```bash\ngrep \"+switch-master\" /var/log/redis/sentinel.log\n```\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 故障现象]**  \n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md > Read-only replica]**", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md", "docs/eval-review.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["replica", "failover", "SENTINEL", "master", "主从切换", "重连", "Sentinel"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md", "docs/eval-review.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "aaaf8b7c-e5b5-42fe-a0fe-c8c62576e07b", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "ae658f79-b597-49a1-a4ca-251ee0bd0499", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来帮你检索这个 Redis 报错的解决方案。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_hqapHrewS3kAZIQpCadhKs', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': \"READONLY You can't write against a read only replica\"})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_tQBcMsqfj1CLbkGcmR1hI4', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': \"READONLY You can't write against a read only replica 报错解决\", 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_hqapHrewS3kAZIQpCadhKs', content='Found 2 files\\ndocs/eval-review.md\\ndocs/runbook/redis-failover.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_tQBcMsqfj1CLbkGcmR1hI4', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.578,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/eval-review.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review > 数据格式设计\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"无论是否引入 Ragas，统一数据格式（兼容 Ragas 的 SingleTurnSample）:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ntest_case = {\\\\\\\\n    #

This does not mean that the feature is intended to expose a replica instance to the internet or more generally to a network where untrusted clients exist, because administrative commands like [`DEBUG`](/commands/debug) or [`CONFIG`](/commands/config) are still enabled. The [Security]() page describes how to secure a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may wonder why it is possible to revert the read-only setting\\\\\\\\nand have replica instances that can be targeted by write operations.\\\\\\\\nThe answer is that writable replicas exist only for historical reasons.\\\\\\\\nUsing writable replicas can result in inconsistency between the master and the replica, so it is not recommended to use writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nTo understand in which situations this can be a problem, we need to understand how replication works.\\\\\\\\nChanges on the master is replicated by propagating regular Redis commands to the replica.\\\\\\\\nWhen a key expires on the master, this is propagated as a DEL command.\\\\\\\\nIf a key which exists on the master but is deleted, expired or has a different type on the replica compared to the master will react differently to commands like DEL, INCR or RPOP propagated from the master than intended.\\\\\\\\nThe propagated command may fail on the replica or result in a different outcome.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risks (if you insist on using writable replicas) we suggest you follow these recommendations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t write to keys in a writable replica that are also used on the master.\\\\\\\\n  (This can be hard to guarantee if you don\\'t have control over all the clients that write to the master.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica as an intermediary step when upgrading a set of instances in a running system.\\\\\\\\n  In general, don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica if it can ever be promoted to a master if you want to guarantee data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHistorically, there were some use cases that were considered legitimate for writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, these use cases are now all obsolete and the same can be achieved by other means.\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Computing slow Set or Sorted set operations and storing the result in temporary local keys using commands like [`SUNIONSTORE`](/commands/sunionstore) and [`ZINTERSTORE`](/commands/zinterstore).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use commands that return the result without storing it, such as [`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and [`ZINTER`](/commands/zinter).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using the [`SORT`](/commands/sort) command (which is not considered a read-only command because of the optional STORE option and therefore cannot be used on a read-only replica).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`SORT_RO`](/commands/sort_ro), which is a read-only command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using [`EVAL`](/commands/eval) and [`EVALSHA`](/commands/evalsha) are also not considered read-only commands, because the Lua script may call write commands.\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`EVAL_RO`](/commands/eval_ro) and [`EVALSHA_RO`](/commands/evalsha_ro) where the Lua script can only call read-only commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile writes to a replica will be discarded if the replica and the master resync or if the replica is restarted, there is no guarantee that they will sync automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore version 4.0, writable replicas were incapable of expiring keys with a time to live set.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if you use [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) or other commands that set a maximum TTL for a key, the key will leak, and while you may no longer see it while accessing it with read commands, you will see it in the count of keys and it will still use memory.\\\\\\\\nRedis 4.0 RC3 and greater versions are able to evict keys with TTL as masters do, with the exceptions of keys written in DB numbers greater than 63 (but by default Redis instances only have 16 databases).\\\\\\\\nNote though that even in versions greater than 4.0, using [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) on a key that could ever exists on the master can cause inconsistency between the replica and the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that since Redis 4.0 replica writes are only local, and are not propagated to sub-replicas attached to the instance. Sub-replicas instead will always receive the replication stream identical to the one sent by the top-level master to the intermediate replicas. So for example in the following setup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    A ---> B ---> C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if `B` is writable, C will not see `B` writes and will instead have identical dataset as the master instance `A`.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.2593,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis functions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Function flags\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In some cases there may be a need to start a fresh Redis server with a set of functions pre-loaded. Common reasons for that could be:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Starting Redis in a new environment\\\\\\\\n* Re-starting an ephemeral (cache-only) Redis, that uses functions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, we need to make sure that the pre-loaded functions are available before Redis accepts inbound user connections and commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo do that, it is possible to use `redis-cli --functions-rdb` to extract the functions from an existing server. This generates an RDB file that can be loaded by Redis at startup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis needs to have some information about how a function is going to behave when executed, in order to properly enforce resource usage policies and maintain data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, Redis needs to know that a certain function is read-only before permitting it to execute using [`FCALL_RO`]() on a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all functions may perform arbitrary read or write operations. Function Flags make it possible to declare more specific function behavior at the time of registration. Let\\'s see how this works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our previous example, we defined two functions that only read data. We can try executing them using [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis > FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n(error) ERR Can not execute a function with write flag using fcall_ro.\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis returns this error because a function can, in theory, perform both read and write operations on the database.\\\\\\\\nAs a safeguard and by default, Redis assumes that the function does both, so it blocks its execution.\\\\\\\\nThe server will reply with this error in the following cases:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Executing a function with [`FCALL`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n2. Using [`FCALL_RO`]() to execute a function.\\\\\\\\n3. A disk error was detected (Redis is unable to persist so it rejects writes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn these cases, you can add the `no-writes` flag to the function\\'s registration, disable the safeguard and allow them to run.\\\\\\\\nTo register a function with flags use the [named arguments]() variant of `redis.register_function`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe updated registration code snippet from the library looks like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function(\\'my_hset\\', my_hset)\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hgetall\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hgetall,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hlastmodified\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hlastmodified,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce we\\'ve replaced the library, Redis allows running both `my_hgetall` and `my_hlastmodified` with [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"myfield\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"some value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_field\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hlastmodified 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1640772721\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the complete documentation flags, please refer to [Script flags]().\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.3325,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Lua API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"_redis_ object {#redis_object} > `redis.register_function` {#redis.register_function} > Script flags {#script_flags}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Important:**\\\\\\\\nUse script flags with care, which may negatively impact if misused.\\\\\\\\nNote that the default for Eval scripts are different than the default for functions that are mentioned below, see [Eval Flags]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you register a function or load an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nThis results in the following behavior:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

The following is the list of its subcommands (minimal version is noted for where applicable):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG GET `<name>`** (`>= 6.2`) Get the current value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter. The specified name may be a wildcard, similar to the Redis [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG SET `<name>` `<value>`** (`>= 6.2`) Set the value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CKQUORUM `<master name>`** Check if the current Sentinel configuration is able to reach the quorum needed to failover a master, and the majority needed to authorize the failover. This command should be used in monitoring systems to check if a Sentinel deployment is ok.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FLUSHCONFIG** Force Sentinel to rewrite its configuration on disk, including the current Sentinel state. Normally Sentinel rewrites the configuration every time something changes in its state (in the context of the subset of the state which is persisted on disk across restart). However sometimes it is possible that the configuration file is lost because of operation errors, disk failures, package upgrade scripts or configuration managers. In those cases a way to force Sentinel to rewrite the configuration file is handy. This command works even if the previous configuration file is completely missing.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FAILOVER `<master name>`** Force a failover as if the master was not reachable, and without asking for agreement to other Sentinels (however a new version of the configuration will be published so that the other Sentinels will update their configurations).\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL GET-MASTER-ADDR-BY-NAME `<master name>`** Return the ip and port number of the master with that name. If a failover is in progress or terminated successfully for this master it returns the address and port of the promoted replica.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL INFO-CACHE** (`>= 3.2`) Return cached [`INFO`](/commands/info) output from masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR <ip> <port> <current-epoch> <runid>** Check if the master specified by ip:port is down from current Sentinel\\'s point of view. This command is mostly for internal use.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTER `<master name>`** Show the state and info of the specified master.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTERS** Show a list of monitored masters and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MONITOR** Start Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MYID** (`>= 6.2`) Return the ID of the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL PENDING-SCRIPTS** This command returns information about pending scripts.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REMOVE** Stop Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REPLICAS `<master name>`** (`>= 5.0`) Show a list of replicas for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SENTINELS `<master name>`** Show a list of sentinel instances for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SET** Set Sentinel\\'s monitoring configuration. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SIMULATE-FAILURE (crash-after-election|crash-after-promotion|help)** (`>= 3.2`) This command simulates different Sentinel crash scenarios.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL RESET `<pattern>`** This command will reset all the masters with matching name. The pattern argument is a glob-style pattern. The reset process clears any previous state in a master (including a failover in progress), and removes every replica and sentinel already discovered and associated with the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor connection management and administration purposes, Sentinel supports the following subset of Redis\\' commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **ACL** (`>= 6.2`) This command manages the Sentinel Access Control List. For more information refer to the [ACL]() documentation page and the [_Sentinel Access Control List authentication_](#sentinel-access-control-list-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **AUTH** (`>= 5.0.1`) Authenticate a client connection. For more information refer to the [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command and the [_Configuring Sentinel instances with authentication_ section](#configuring-sentinel-instances-with-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **CLIENT** This command manages client connections. For more information refer to its subcommands\\' pages.\\\\\\\\n* **COMMAND** (`>= 6.2`) This command returns information about commands. For more information refer to the [`COMMAND`](/commands/command) command and its various subcommands.\\\\\\\\n* **HELLO** (`>= 6.0`) Switch the connection\\'s protocol. For more information refer to the [`HELLO`](/commands/hello) command.\\\\\\\\n* **INFO** Return information and statistics about the Sentinel server. For more information see the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command.\\\\\\\\n* **PING** This command simply returns PONG.\\\\\\\\n* **ROLE** This command returns the string \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a list of monitored masters. For more information refer to the [`ROLE`](/commands/role) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SHUTDOWN** Shut down the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, Sentinel also supports the [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe), [`UNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/unsubscribe), [`PSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/psubscribe) and [`PUNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/punsubscribe) commands.

If you set a password\\\\\\\\nand check the output of [`ACL LIST`](/commands/acl-list) or [`ACL GETUSER`](/commands/acl-getuser), you\\'ll see a long hex\\\\\\\\nstring that looks pseudo random. Here is an example, because in the previous\\\\\\\\nexamples, for the sake of brevity, the long hex string was trimmed:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> ACL GETUSER default\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"flags\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"on\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"passwords\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2d9c75273d72b32df726fb545c8a4edc719f0a95a6fd993950b10c474ad9c927\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"commands\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"+@all\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"keys\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"~*\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"channels\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"&*\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"selectors\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) (empty array)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing SHA256 provides the ability to avoid storing the password in clear text\\\\\\\\nwhile still allowing for a very fast [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command, which is a very important\\\\\\\\nfeature of Redis and is coherent with what clients expect from Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever ACL *passwords* are not really passwords. They are shared secrets\\\\\\\\nbetween the server and the client, because the password is\\\\\\\\nnot an authentication token used by a human being. For instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* There are no length limits, the password will just be memorized in some client software. There is no human that needs to recall a password in this context.\\\\\\\\n* The ACL password does not protect any other thing. For example, it will never be the password for some email account.\\\\\\\\n* Often when you are able to access the hashed password itself, by having full access to the Redis commands of a given server, or corrupting the system itself, you already have access to what the password is protecting: the Redis instance stability and the data it contains.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor this reason, slowing down the password authentication, in order to use an\\\\\\\\nalgorithm that uses time and space to make password cracking hard,\\\\\\\\nis a very poor choice. What we suggest instead is to generate strong\\\\\\\\npasswords, so that nobody will be able to crack it using a\\\\\\\\ndictionary or a brute force attack even if they have the hash. To do so, there is a special ACL\\\\\\\\ncommand [`ACL GENPASS`](/commands/acl-genpass) that generates passwords using the system cryptographic pseudorandom\\\\\\\\ngenerator:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    > ACL GENPASS\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"dd721260bfe1b3d9601e7fbab36de6d04e2e67b0ef1c53de59d45950db0dd3cc\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe command outputs a 32-byte (256-bit) pseudorandom string converted to a\\\\\\\\n64-byte alphanumerical string. This is long enough to avoid attacks and short\\\\\\\\nenough to be easy to manage, cut & paste, store, and so forth. This is what\\\\\\\\nyou should use in order to generate Redis passwords.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.0464,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"498bf3fa\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"498bf3fa-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/archive/STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🎉 知识库搜索系统 - 已达到良好状态 > 🎯 当前状态\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"unknown\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**系统已达到良好状态，可以进行性能测试和演示！**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**后台任务**:\\\\\\\\n- K8s 文档索引: 进行中（8/10）\\\\\\\\n- Redis 文档索引: 进行中（7/10）\\\\\\\\n- 预计完成时间: 5-10 分钟\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**建议**:\\\\\\\\n等待索引完成后，运行性能测试验证核心价值假设。\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**准备就绪！** 🎉\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.6749,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e051e108\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e051e108-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/archive/PROJECT_STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"PROJECT_STATUS.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🎉 知识库搜索系统 - 项目完成状态 > 💡 核心价值 > 4.

In this case the\\\\\\\\nserver will emit a log like the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n* Reading RDB preamble from AOF file...\\\\\\\\n* Reading the remaining AOF tail...\\\\\\\\n# !!!

This may\\\\\\\\nsound unexpected as in the first part of this tutorial we stated that Redis\\\\\\\\nCluster can lose writes during the failover because it uses asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication. What we did not say is that this is not very likely to happen\\\\\\\\nbecause Redis sends the reply to the client, and the commands to replicate\\\\\\\\nto the replicas, about at the same time, so there is a very small window to\\\\\\\\nlose data.

Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.2793,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis signal handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Kill the RDB file without errors\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The following signals are handled as a Redis crash:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* SIGSEGV\\\\\\\\n* SIGBUS\\\\\\\\n* SIGFPE\\\\\\\\n* SIGILL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce one of these signals is trapped, Redis stops any current operation and performs the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Adds a bug report to the log file.

This signal is handled in a special way:\\\\\\\\nit kills the child process like any other signal, but the parent process will\\\\\\\\nnot detect this as a critical error and will continue to serve write\\\\\\\\nrequests.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.3663,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5387b75c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5387b75c-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redisce/redisos-8.4-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redisos 8.4 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Open Source 8.4.1 (February 2026) > Configuration parameters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7960](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7960) Persist query warnings across cursor reads (MOD-12984).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7612](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7612) Track `maxprefixexpansions` errors and warnings in info (MOD-12417).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7872](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7872) Handle warnings in empty `FT.AGGREGATE` replies in cluster mode (MOD-12640).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7900](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7900) Support multiple warnings in reply (MOD-13252).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7576](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7576) Track OOM errors and warnings in info (MOD-12418).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7507](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7507) Track timeout errors and warnings in info (MOD-12419).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7341](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7341) Rename `FT.PROFILE` counter fields for clarity .(MOD-6056)\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7436](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7436), RediSearch/RediSearch[#7427](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7427) Enhance `FT.PROFILE` with vector search execution details (MOD-12263).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7573](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7573) Debug support for `FT.PROFILE` command (MOD-12627).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7736](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7736) Add `Internal cursor reads` metric to cluster `FT.PROFILE` output (MOD-12414).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7692](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7692) Declare query error struct on `_FT.CURSOR PROFILE` (MOD-12955).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7848](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7848) Store and display shard ID in profile output (MOD-12321).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7422](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7422) Track syntax and argument errors in query error metrics (MOD-12416).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7552](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7552) Add `active_io_threads` metric (MOD-12069, MOD-12695).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7622](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7622) Add `active_coord_threads` metric (MOD-12694, MOD-12069).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7564](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7564) Add `active_worker_threads` metric (MOD-12694, MOD-12069).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7626](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7626) Add `*_pending_jobs` metrics for job queues (MOD-12069).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7658](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7658) Add pending workers admin jobs metric (MOD-12069, MOD-12791).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7731](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7731) Add `active_topology_update_threads` metric (MOD-12069, MOD-12790).\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7760](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7760) Extend indexing metrics for more detailed performance data (MOD-12070).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch/RediSearch[#7083](https://github.com/redisearch/redisearch/pull/7083) Add default scorer configuration option (MOD-10037).\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"根据检索结果，Redis 大量写入失败最常见的原因是 **主从切换后应用仍连接旧 master（已降为 replica）**，导致 `READONLY` 错误。\\n\\n## 故障原因\\n\\n当 Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换（failover）后：\\n- 旧 master 降级为 replica（只读）\\n- 应用如果未及时切换连接，继续向旧节点写入\\n- 触发大量 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\\n\\n## 快速恢复步骤\\n\\n### 1. 确认是否主从切换\\n\\n```bash\\n# 查看 Sentinel 日志，确认是否有 +switch-master 事件\\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n```\\n\\n### 2. 自动恢复（推荐）\\n\\n如果应用使用 **Sentinel 客户端**（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel）：\\n\\n- 连接会自动切换到新 master\\n- 检查客户端配置：\\n  -

状态和事件\n```bash\nkubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>\n```\n\n重点关注：\n- **OOMKilled** — 容器超出内存限制\n- **Error** — 应用启动时崩溃\n- **ContainerCannotRun** — 镜像或入口点问题\n\n### 2. 查看崩溃日志\n```bash\n# 当前崩溃日志\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>\n\n# 上一次崩溃日志（更有价值）\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous\n```\n\n### 3. 检查资源限制\n```bash\nkubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].resources}'\n```\n\n如果是 OOMKilled，增加内存限制：\n```yaml\nresources:\n  requests:\n    memory: \"256Mi\"\n  limits:\n    memory: \"512Mi\"\n```\n\n### 4. 检查存活探针配置\n```bash\nkubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].livenessProbe}'\n```\n\n常见问题：\n- `initialDelaySeconds` 对于慢启动应用设置太短\n- 健康检查端点实现不正确\n- 探针超时设置过于激进\n\n## 常见原因和修复方案\n\n| 原因 | 修复方法 |\n|------|---------|\n| OOMKilled | 增加内存限制或修复内存泄漏 |\n| 配置错误 | 检查 ConfigMap/Secret 挂载、环境变量 |\n| 依赖服务缺失 | 确保依赖服务正在运行 |\n| 镜像问题 | 验证镜像标签和仓库访问权限 |\n| 存活探针失败 | 调整探针时间或修复健康检查端点 |\n| 权限拒绝 | 检查 SecurityContext 和 RBAC |\n\n## 紧急处理\n\n如果问题持续超过 30 分钟：\n1. 通知应用团队负责人\n2. 检查最近的部署：`kubectl rollout history deployment/<name>`\n3. 考虑回滚：`kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name>`\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/kubernetes-pod-crashloop.md > Kubernetes Pod CrashLoopBackOff Troubleshooting Guide]**", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"],

解决方案：使用 Refresh Token\n\n系统实际上提供了 **refresh_token 机制**，可以避免频繁重新登录：\n\n### 工作流程\n\n1. **首次登录**时，服务端会同时返回两个 token：\n   - `access_token`（15分钟有效期）\n   - `refresh_token`（7天有效期）\n\n2. **access_token 过期后**，不需要重新输入用户名密码，而是：\n   - 用 `refresh_token` 调用 `/api/v1/auth/refresh` 接口\n   - 获取新的 access_token\n   - 继续使用\n\n3. **只有 refresh_token 也过期**（7天后）才需要重新登录\n\n### 错误码识别\n\n当你收到 `401 TOKEN_EXPIRED` 错误时，说明 access_token 过期了，此时应该：\n- ✅ 自动调用 refresh 接口换新 token\n- ❌ 不要直接跳转到登录页\n\n### 实现建议\n\n客户端应该实现自动刷新逻辑：\n```javascript\n// 伪代码示例\nif (response.status === 401 && response.error === 'TOKEN_EXPIRED') {\n  const newToken = await refreshAccessToken(refresh_token);\n  // 用新 token 重试原请求\n}\n```\n\n这样用户在 7 天内都不需要重新登录，只有在 refresh_token 也过期时才需要输入密码。\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/api/authentication.md > API

ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When the key is accessed by a command and is found to be expired.\\\\\\\\n* Via a background system that looks for expired keys in the background, incrementally, in order to be able to also collect keys that are never accessed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `expired` events are generated when a key is accessed and is found to be expired by one of the above systems, as a result there are no guarantees that the Redis server will be able to generate the `expired` event at the time the key time to live reaches the value of zero.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf no command targets the key constantly, and there are many keys with a TTL associated, there can be a significant delay between the time the key time to live drops to zero, and the time the `expired` event is generated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExpired (`expired`) events are generated when the Redis server deletes the key and not when the time to live theoretically reaches the value of zero.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node of a Redis cluster generates events about its own subset of the keyspace as described above.

However, a new version of the configuration will be published so that other Sentinels will update their configurations accordingly.\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **No consensus required**: Unlike automatic failovers, this command doesn't require agreement from other Sentinels\n- **Configuration propagation**: The new configuration is still broadcast to other Sentinels so they can update\n- **Use case**: Commonly used for maintenance tasks, such as upgrading a Redis master instance with minimal downtime\n\n## Manual Failover Process\n\nWhen you execute a manual failover on a replica, the system ensures data safety by:\n\n1. Pausing clients connected to the current master\n2. The master sends its replication offset to the replica\n3. The replica waits until it processes all replication data from the old master\n4. Only then does the failover election start\n5. Clients are redirected to the new master once the switch is complete\n\nThis approach avoids data loss by ensuring the new master has processed all replication stream from the old master before taking over.\n\n**[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Sentinel API > Sentinel commands]**", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "docs/eval-review.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["replica", "failover", "SENTINEL", "master", "manual", "Sentinel"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "docs/eval-review.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "dcc1c5ea-ebec-4246-ba65-dd104b2c5049", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "efdd2afd-b9f4-47d9-b3c3-4a6450599f32", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about manually triggering Redis Sentinel failover.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_bSlf3VqIQ8fhXvJmUL4OnY', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'sentinel failover|SENTINEL FAILOVER|manual failover'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_QZLkMIEls3QgMomVmK5I60', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'manually trigger Redis Sentinel failover command', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_bSlf3VqIQ8fhXvJmUL4OnY', content='Found 2 files\\ndocs/eval-review.md\\ndocs/runbook/redis-failover.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_QZLkMIEls3QgMomVmK5I60', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.9487,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis service discovery via Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel is a monitoring solution for Redis instances that handles\\\\\\\\nautomatic failover of Redis masters and service discovery (who is the current\\\\\\\\nmaster for a given group of instances?).

The following is the list of its subcommands (minimal version is noted for where applicable):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG GET `<name>`** (`>= 6.2`) Get the current value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter. The specified name may be a wildcard, similar to the Redis [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG SET `<name>` `<value>`** (`>= 6.2`) Set the value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CKQUORUM `<master name>`** Check if the current Sentinel configuration is able to reach the quorum needed to failover a master, and the majority needed to authorize the failover. This command should be used in monitoring systems to check if a Sentinel deployment is ok.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FLUSHCONFIG** Force Sentinel to rewrite its configuration on disk, including the current Sentinel state. Normally Sentinel rewrites the configuration every time something changes in its state (in the context of the subset of the state which is persisted on disk across restart). However sometimes it is possible that the configuration file is lost because of operation errors, disk failures, package upgrade scripts or configuration managers. In those cases a way to force Sentinel to rewrite the configuration file is handy. This command works even if the previous configuration file is completely missing.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FAILOVER `<master name>`** Force a failover as if the master was not reachable, and without asking for agreement to other Sentinels (however a new version of the configuration will be published so that the other Sentinels will update their configurations).\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL GET-MASTER-ADDR-BY-NAME `<master name>`** Return the ip and port number of the master with that name. If a failover is in progress or terminated successfully for this master it returns the address and port of the promoted replica.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL INFO-CACHE** (`>= 3.2`) Return cached [`INFO`](/commands/info) output from masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR <ip> <port> <current-epoch> <runid>** Check if the master specified by ip:port is down from current Sentinel\\'s point of view. This command is mostly for internal use.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTER `<master name>`** Show the state and info of the specified master.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTERS** Show a list of monitored masters and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MONITOR** Start Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MYID** (`>= 6.2`) Return the ID of the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL PENDING-SCRIPTS** This command returns information about pending scripts.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REMOVE** Stop Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REPLICAS `<master name>`** (`>= 5.0`) Show a list of replicas for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SENTINELS `<master name>`** Show a list of sentinel instances for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SET** Set Sentinel\\'s monitoring configuration. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SIMULATE-FAILURE (crash-after-election|crash-after-promotion|help)** (`>= 3.2`) This command simulates different Sentinel crash scenarios.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL RESET `<pattern>`** This command will reset all the masters with matching name. The pattern argument is a glob-style pattern. The reset process clears any previous state in a master (including a failover in progress), and removes every replica and sentinel already discovered and associated with the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor connection management and administration purposes, Sentinel supports the following subset of Redis\\' commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **ACL** (`>= 6.2`) This command manages the Sentinel Access Control List. For more information refer to the [ACL]() documentation page and the [_Sentinel Access Control List authentication_](#sentinel-access-control-list-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **AUTH** (`>= 5.0.1`) Authenticate a client connection. For more information refer to the [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command and the [_Configuring Sentinel instances with authentication_ section](#configuring-sentinel-instances-with-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **CLIENT** This command manages client connections. For more information refer to its subcommands\\' pages.\\\\\\\\n* **COMMAND** (`>= 6.2`) This command returns information about commands. For more information refer to the [`COMMAND`](/commands/command) command and its various subcommands.\\\\\\\\n* **HELLO** (`>= 6.0`) Switch the connection\\'s protocol. For more information refer to the [`HELLO`](/commands/hello) command.\\\\\\\\n* **INFO** Return information and statistics about the Sentinel server. For more information see the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command.\\\\\\\\n* **PING** This command simply returns PONG.\\\\\\\\n* **ROLE** This command returns the string \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a list of monitored masters. For more information refer to the [`ROLE`](/commands/role) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SHUTDOWN** Shut down the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, Sentinel also supports the [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe), [`UNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/unsubscribe), [`PSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/psubscribe) and [`PUNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/punsubscribe) commands.

At the same time all the Sentinels wait for messages to see what is the configuration\\\\\\\\nadvertised by the other Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfigurations are broadcast in the `__sentinel__:hello` Pub/Sub channel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause every configuration has a different version number, the greater version\\\\\\\\nalways wins over smaller versions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example the configuration for the master `mymaster` start with all the\\\\\\\\nSentinels believing the master is at 192.168.1.50:6379. This configuration\\\\\\\\nhas version 1. After some time a Sentinel is authorized to failover with version 2. If the failover is successful, it will start to broadcast a new configuration, let\\'s say 192.168.1.50:9000, with version 2. All the other instances will see this configuration and will update their configuration accordingly, since the new configuration has a greater version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that Sentinel guarantees a second liveness property: a set of\\\\\\\\nSentinels that are able to communicate will all converge to the same configuration with the higher version number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically if the net is partitioned, every partition will converge to the higher\\\\\\\\nlocal configuration. In the special case of no partitions, there is a single\\\\\\\\npartition and every Sentinel will agree about the configuration.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2875,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Manual failover\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Sometimes it is useful to force a failover without actually causing any problem\\\\\\\\non a master. For example, to upgrade the Redis process of one of the\\\\\\\\nmaster nodes it is a good idea to failover it to turn it into a replica\\\\\\\\nwith minimal impact on availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are supported by Redis Cluster using the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)\\\\\\\\ncommand, that must be executed in one of the replicas of the master you want\\\\\\\\nto failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are special and are safer compared to failovers resulting from\\\\\\\\nactual master failures. They occur in a way that avoids data loss in the\\\\\\\\nprocess, by switching clients from the original master to the new master only\\\\\\\\nwhen the system is sure that the new master processed all the replication stream\\\\\\\\nfrom the old one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what you see in the replica log when you perform a manual failover:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Manual failover user request accepted.\\\\\\\\n    # Received replication offset for paused master manual failover: 347540\\\\\\\\n    # All master replication stream processed, manual failover can start.\\\\\\\\n    # Start of election delayed for 0 milliseconds (rank #0, offset 347540).\\\\\\\\n    # Starting a failover election for epoch 7545.\\\\\\\\n    # Failover election won: I\\'m the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically clients connected to the master we are failing over are stopped.\\\\\\\\nAt the same time the master sends its replication offset to the replica, that\\\\\\\\nwaits to reach the offset on its side.

When the clients are unblocked on the old master, they are redirected\\\\\\\\nto the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTo promote a replica to master, it must first be known as a replica by a majority of the masters in the cluster.\\\\\\\\n  Otherwise, it cannot win the failover election.\\\\\\\\n  If the replica has just been added to the cluster (see [Add a new node as a replica](#add-a-new-node-as-a-replica)), you may need to wait a while before sending the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover) command, to make sure the masters in cluster are aware of the new replica.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6095,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-022\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > SDOWN and ODOWN failure state\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel has two different concepts of *being down*, one is called\\\\\\\\na *Subjectively Down* condition (SDOWN) and is a down condition that is\\\\\\\\nlocal to a given Sentinel instance. Another is called *Objectively Down*\\\\\\\\ncondition (ODOWN) and is reached when enough Sentinels (at least the\\\\\\\\nnumber configured as the `quorum` parameter of the monitored master) have\\\\\\\\nan SDOWN condition, and get feedback from other Sentinels using\\\\\\\\nthe `SENTINEL is-master-down-by-addr` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of a Sentinel an SDOWN condition is reached when it\\\\\\\\ndoes not receive a valid reply to PING requests for the number of seconds\\\\\\\\nspecified in the configuration as `is-master-down-after-milliseconds`\\\\\\\\nparameter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn acceptable reply to PING is one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with +PONG.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -LOADING error.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -MASTERDOWN error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAny other reply (or no reply at all) is considered non valid.\\\\\\\\nHowever note that **a logical master that advertises itself as a replica in\\\\\\\\nthe INFO output is considered to be down**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that SDOWN requires that no acceptable reply is received for the whole\\\\\\\\ninterval configured, so for instance if the interval is 30000 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n(30 seconds) and we receive an acceptable ping reply every 29 seconds, the\\\\\\\\ninstance is considered to be working.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSDOWN is not enough to trigger a failover: it only means a single Sentinel\\\\\\\\nbelieves a Redis instance is not available. To trigger a failover, the\\\\\\\\nODOWN state must be reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo switch from SDOWN to ODOWN no strong consensus algorithm is used, but\\\\\\\\njust a form of gossip: if a given Sentinel gets reports that a master\\\\\\\\nis not working from enough Sentinels **in a given time range**, the SDOWN is\\\\\\\\npromoted to ODOWN. If this acknowledge is later missing, the flag is cleared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA more strict authorization that uses an actual majority is required in\\\\\\\\norder to really start the failover, but no failover can be triggered without\\\\\\\\nreaching the ODOWN state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ODOWN condition **only applies to masters**. For other kind of instances\\\\\\\\nSentinel doesn\\'t require to act, so the ODOWN state is never reached for replicas\\\\\\\\nand other sentinels, but only SDOWN is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever SDOWN has also semantic implications. For example a replica in SDOWN\\\\\\\\nstate is not selected to be promoted by a Sentinel performing a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels and replicas auto discovery\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels stay connected with other Sentinels in order to reciprocally\\\\\\\\ncheck the availability of each other, and to exchange messages. However you\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t need to configure a list of other Sentinel addresses in every Sentinel\\\\\\\\ninstance you run, as Sentinel uses the Redis instances Pub/Sub capabilities\\\\\\\\nin order to discover the other Sentinels that are monitoring the same masters\\\\\\\\nand replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is implemented by sending *hello messages* into the channel named\\\\\\\\n`__sentinel__:hello`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly you don\\'t need to configure what is the list of the replicas attached\\\\\\\\nto a master, as Sentinel will auto discover this list querying Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel publishes a message to every monitored master and replica Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello`, every two seconds, announcing its presence with ip, port, runid.\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel is subscribed to the Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello` of every master and replica, looking for unknown sentinels. When new sentinels are detected, they are added as sentinels of this master.\\\\\\\\n* Hello messages also include the full current configuration of the master. If the receiving Sentinel has a configuration for a given master which is older than the one received, it updates to the new configuration immediately.\\\\\\\\n* Before adding a new sentinel to a master a Sentinel always checks if there is already a sentinel with the same runid or the same address (ip and port pair). In that case all the matching sentinels are removed, and the new added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel reconfiguration of instances outside the failover procedure\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven when no failover is in progress, Sentinels will always try to set the\\\\\\\\ncurrent configuration on monitored instances. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Replicas (according to the current configuration) that claim to be masters, will be configured as replicas to replicate with the current master.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas connected to a wrong master, will be reconfigured to replicate with the right master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinels to reconfigure replicas, the wrong configuration must be observed for some time, that is greater than the period used to broadcast new configurations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis prevents Sentinels with a stale configuration (for example because they just rejoined from a partition) will try to change the replicas configuration before receiving an update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note how the semantics of always trying to impose the current configuration makes the failover more resistant to partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Masters failed over are reconfigured as replicas when they return available.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas partitioned away during a partition are reconfigured once reachable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe important lesson to remember about this section is: **Sentinel is a system where each process will always try to impose the last logical configuration to the set of monitored instances**.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Based on the search results, here's how to manually trigger a Redis Sentinel failover:\\n\\n## Command\\n\\n```bash\\nSENTINEL FAILOVER <master name>\\n```\\n\\nThis command forces a failover as if the master was not reachable, without asking for agreement from other Sentinels.

in Redis Open Source used to estimate the `K` highest-rank elements from a stream.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Highest-rank\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in this case means \\\\\\\\\\\\\"elements with a highest number or score attached to them\\\\\\\\\\\\\", where the score can be a count of how many times the element has appeared in the stream - thus making the data structure perfect for finding the elements with the highest frequency in a stream.\\\\\\\\nOne very common application is detecting network anomalies and DDoS attacks where Top K can answer the question: Is there a sudden increase in the flux of requests to the same address or from the same IP?\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Open Source implementation of Top-K is based on the [HeavyKeepers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong) algorithm presented by Junzhi Gong et al. It discards some older approaches like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"count-all\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"admit-all-count-some\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in favour of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**count-with-exponential-decay**\\\\\\\\\\\\\" strategy which is biased against mouse (small) flows and has a limited impact on elephant (large) flows. This implementation uses two data structures in tandem: a hash table that holds the probabilistic counts (much like the Count-Min Sketch), and a min heap that holds the `K` items with the highest counts. This ensures high accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms allowed, while keeping memory utilization to a fraction of what is typically required by a Sorted Set. It has the additional benefit of being able to get real time notifications when elements are added or removed from the Top K list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trending hashtags (social media platforms, news distribution networks)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What are the K hashtags people have mentioned the most in the last X hours? \\\\\\\\n- What are the K news with highest read/view count today? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData flow is the incoming social media posts from which you parse out the different hashtags. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`TOPK.LIST`]() command has a time complexity of `O(K*log(k))` so if `K` is small, there is no need to keep a separate set or sorted set of all the hashtags. You can query directly from the Top K itself.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -1.8076,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"api-auth-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"api-auth-001-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/api/authentication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"API 认证与授权设计文档\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"API 认证与授权设计文档 > 认证方式 > Token 验证\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"1. 客户端发送用户名密码到 `/api/v1/auth/login`\\\\\\\\n2. 服务端验证凭据，签发 access_token（15分钟）和 refresh_token（7天）\\\\\\\\n3. 客户端在后续请求的 `Authorization: Bearer <token>` 头中携带 access_token\\\\\\\\n4. access_token 过期后，用 refresh_token 到 `/api/v1/auth/refresh` 换取新 token\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sub\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"user-uuid\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"iss\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"api-gateway\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"iat\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 1707820800,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"exp\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 1707821700,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"roles\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"admin\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"editor\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"tenant_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"tenant-001\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n每个微服务独立验证 JWT：\\\\\\\\n- 验证签名（RS256，公钥从 JWKS endpoint 获取）\\\\\\\\n- 验证 `exp` 未过期\\\\\\\\n- 验证 `iss` 匹配\\\\\\\\n- 从 `roles` 字段提取权限\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -4.0924,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-085\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Blocking clients from modules > `RedisModule_RegisterAuthCallback`\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"void RedisModule_RegisterAuthCallback(RedisModuleCtx *ctx,\\\\\\\\n                                          RedisModuleAuthCallback cb);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 7.2.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis API registers a callback to execute in addition to normal password based authentication.\\\\\\\\nMultiple callbacks can be registered across different modules. When a Module is unloaded, all the\\\\\\\\nauth callbacks registered by it are unregistered.\\\\\\\\nThe callbacks are attempted (in the order of most recently registered first) when the AUTH/HELLO\\\\\\\\n(with AUTH field provided) commands are called.\\\\\\\\nThe callbacks will be called with a module context along with a username and a password, and are\\\\\\\\nexpected to take one of the following actions:\\\\\\\\n(1) Authenticate - Use the `RedisModule_AuthenticateClient`* API and return `REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED`.\\\\\\\\nThis will immediately end the auth chain as successful and add the OK reply.\\\\\\\\n(2) Deny Authentication - Return `REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED` without authenticating or blocking the\\\\\\\\nclient. Optionally, `err` can be set to a custom error message and `err` will be automatically\\\\\\\\nfreed by the server.\\\\\\\\nThis will immediately end the auth chain as unsuccessful and add the ERR reply.\\\\\\\\n(3) Block a client on authentication - Use the [`RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth`](#RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth) API and return\\\\\\\\n`REDISMODULE_AUTH_HANDLED`. Here, the client will be blocked until the [`RedisModule_UnblockClient`](#RedisModule_UnblockClient) API is used\\\\\\\\nwhich will trigger the auth reply callback (provided through the [`RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth`](#RedisModule_BlockClientOnAuth)).\\\\\\\\nIn this reply callback, the Module should authenticate, deny or skip handling authentication.\\\\\\\\n(4) Skip handling Authentication - Return `REDISMODULE_AUTH_NOT_HANDLED` without blocking the\\\\\\\\nclient. This will allow the engine to attempt the next module auth callback.\\\\\\\\nIf none of the callbacks authenticate or deny auth, then password based auth is attempted and\\\\\\\\nwill authenticate or add failure logs and reply to the clients accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: If a client is disconnected while it was in the middle of blocking module auth, that\\\\\\\\noccurrence of the AUTH or HELLO command will not be tracked in the INFO command stats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of how non-blocking module based authentication can be used:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n     int

Since Sentinel is both responsible\\\\\\\\nfor reconfiguring instances during failovers, and providing configurations to\\\\\\\\nclients connecting to Redis masters or replicas, clients are required to have\\\\\\\\nexplicit support for Redis Sentinel.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis document is targeted at Redis clients developers that want to support Sentinel in their clients implementation with the following goals:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Automatic configuration of clients via Sentinel.\\\\\\\\n* Improved safety of Redis Sentinel automatic failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor details about how Redis Sentinel works, please check the [Redis Documentation](), as this document only contains information needed for Redis client developers, and it is expected that readers are familiar with the way Redis Sentinel works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel identifies every master with a name like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stats\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\nEvery name actually identifies a *group of instances*, composed of a master\\\\\\\\nand a variable number of replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe address of the Redis master that is used for a specific purpose inside a network may change after events like an automatic failover, a manually triggered failover (for instance in order to upgrade a Redis instance), and other reasons.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally Redis clients have some kind of hard-coded configuration that specifies the address of a Redis master instance within a network as IP address and port number. However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel. So instead of a hard coded IP address and port, a client supporting Sentinel should optionally be able to take as input:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A list of ip:port pairs pointing to known Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* The name of the service, like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"timelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the procedure a client should follow in order to obtain the master address starting from the list of Sentinels and the service name.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.0288,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/eval-review.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review > 数据格式设计\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"无论是否引入 Ragas，统一数据格式（兼容 Ragas 的 SingleTurnSample）:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ntest_case = {\\\\\\\\n    # 输入\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"user_input\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"READONLY You can\\'t write against a read only replica 怎么解决\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # 检索结果（从 Agent 日志提取）\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"retrieved_contexts\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换后...\\\\\\\\\\\\\",  # chunk text\\\\\\\\n    ],\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Agent 输出\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"response\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"根据文档，这个错误是 Redis Sentinel 主从切换导致的...\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Ground truth（手写）\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"reference\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"READONLY 错误是 Redis Sentinel failover 后，应用仍连接旧 master（已降为 replica）导致。解决方案：使用 Sentinel 客户端自动切换。\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # 元数据\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"expected_doc\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"redis-failover.md\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"source\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"local\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"exact\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n这个格式可以直接喂给:\\\\\\\\n- 我们的自建评估函数\\\\\\\\n- Ragas 的 `SingleTurnSample`\\\\\\\\n- 任何其他评测框架\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='根据检索结果，Redis 主从切换后客户端自动重连的方案如下：\\n\\n## 使用 Sentinel 客户端（推荐）\\n\\n如果应用使用 **Sentinel 客户端**（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会**自动切换**到新的 master。需要确认：\\n\\n1. **客户端配置了 Sentinel 地址**，而非直连 master IP\\n2. **连接池的 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置已开启**\\n3. 等待 30 秒，观察错误率是否下降\\n\\n## 工作原理\\n\\nSentinel 客户端通过以下机制实现自动重连：\\n\\n- 客户端启动时从 Sentinel 获取当前 master 地址\\n- Sentinel 检测到 master 故障后触发 failover，选举新 master\\n- Sentinel 向订阅的客户端推送 `+switch-master` 事件\\n- 客户端收到通知后自动更新连接池，指向新 master\\n\\n## 如果应用直连 master IP（不推荐）\\n\\n需要手动干预：\\n\\n1. 获取新 master 地址：\\n   ```bash\\n   redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n   ```\\n\\n2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\\n\\n3. 滚动重启应用：\\n   ```bash\\n   kubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\\n   ```\\n\\n## 最佳实践\\n\\n- **所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP**\\n- 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\\n- 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\\n\\n---\\n\\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 恢复操作 > 手动恢复]**  \\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md > Redis service discovery via Sentinel]**')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "根据检索结果，Redis 主从切换后客户端自动重连的方案如下：\n\n## 使用 Sentinel 客户端（推荐）\n\n如果应用使用 **Sentinel 客户端**（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会**自动切换**到新的 master。需要确认：\n\n1. **客户端配置了 Sentinel 地址**，而非直连 master IP\n2. **连接池的 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置已开启**\n3. 等待 30 秒，观察错误率是否下降\n\n## 工作原理\n\nSentinel 客户端通过以下机制实现自动重连：\n\n- 客户端启动时从 Sentinel 获取当前 master 地址\n- Sentinel 检测到 master 故障后触发 failover，选举新 master\n- Sentinel 向订阅的客户端推送 `+switch-master` 事件\n- 客户端收到通知后自动更新连接池，指向新 master\n\n## 如果应用直连 master IP（不推荐）\n\n需要手动干预：\n\n1. 获取新 master 地址：\n   ```bash\n   redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n   ```\n\n2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\n\n3. 滚动重启应用：\n   ```bash\n   kubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\n   ```\n\n## 最佳实践\n\n- **所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP**\n- 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\n- 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 恢复操作 > 手动恢复]**  \n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md > Redis service discovery via Sentinel]**", "session_id": "b7ae3520-2edc-45d4-9496-ba63714c2298", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 86636, "total_cost_usd": 0.05111975, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1224, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2449, "cache_read_input_tokens": 30637, "output_tokens": 575, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

Check logs to confirm:**\n```bash\n# Current crash logs\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>\n\n# Previous crash logs (from before the restart)\nkubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous\n```\n\n## Fix OOMKilled Issues\n\nIf the container is being killed due to memory limits, increase them:\n\n```yaml\nresources:\n  requests:\n    memory: \"256Mi\"\n  limits:\n    memory: \"512Mi\"\n```\n\n## Other Common Causes\n\nIf it's not OOMKilled, check for:\n- **Config errors**: Verify ConfigMap/Secret mounts and environment variables\n- **Liveness probe failures**: The probe might be too aggressive for slow-starting apps\n- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure required services are running\n\n[来源: docs/runbook/kubernetes-pod-crashloop.md > Kubernetes Pod CrashLoopBackOff Troubleshooting Guide > Diagnostic Steps > 4.

At some point a single\\\\\\\\nbox may not be enough anyway, so if you want to use multiple CPUs you can\\\\\\\\nstart thinking of some way to shard earlier.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can find more information about using multiple Redis instances in the [Partitioning page]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs of version 4.0, Redis has started implementing threaded actions. For now this is limited to deleting objects in the background and blocking commands implemented via Redis modules. For subsequent releases, the plan is to make Redis more and more threaded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis can handle up to 2^32 keys, and was tested in practice to\\\\\\\\nhandle at least 250 million keys per instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery hash, list, set, and sorted set, can hold 2^32 elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn other words your limit is likely the available memory in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you use keys with limited time to live (Redis expires) this is normal behavior. This is what happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The primary generates an RDB file on the first synchronization with the replica.\\\\\\\\n* The RDB file will not include keys already expired in the primary but which are still in memory.\\\\\\\\n* These keys are still in the memory of the Redis primary, even if logically expired. They\\'ll be considered non-existent, and their memory will be reclaimed later, either incrementally or explicitly on access. While these keys are not logically part of the dataset, they are accounted for in the [`INFO`]() output and in the [`DBSIZE`]() command.\\\\\\\\n* When the replica reads the RDB file generated by the primary, this set of keys will not be loaded.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of this, it\\'s common for users with many expired keys to see fewer keys in the replicas. However, logically, the primary and replica will have the same content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is an acronym that stands for **RE**mote **DI**ctionary **S**erver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSalvatore originally created Redis to scale [LLOOGG](https://github.com/antirez/lloogg), a real-time log analysis tool. But after getting the basic Redis server working, he decided to share the work with other people and turn Redis into an open source project.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (/ˈrɛd-ɪs/) is pronounced like the word \\\\\\\\\\\\\"red\\\\\\\\\\\\\" plus the word \\\\\\\\\\\\\"kiss\\\\\\\\\\\\\" without the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"k\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.5265,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"k8s-crashloop-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"k8s-crashloop-001-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/runbook/kubernetes-pod-crashloop.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Kubernetes Pod CrashLoopBackOff Troubleshooting Guide\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Kubernetes Pod CrashLoopBackOff Troubleshooting Guide > Symptoms\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Pod in `CrashLoopBackOff` state means the container is repeatedly crashing and Kubernetes is backing off before restarting it.

\\\\\"With the previous section in mind, it is easier to see how update messages\\\\\\\\nwork. Node A may rejoin the cluster after some time. It will send heartbeat\\\\\\\\npackets where it claims it serves hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch\\\\\\\\nof 3. All the receivers with updated information will instead see that\\\\\\\\nthe same hash slots are associated with node B having a higher configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch. Because of this they\\'ll send an `UPDATE` message to A with the new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration for the slots. A will update its configuration because of the\\\\\\\\n**rule 2** above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same basic mechanism is used when a node rejoins a cluster.\\\\\\\\nContinuing with the example above, node A will be notified\\\\\\\\nthat hash slots 1 and 2 are now served by B. Assuming that these two were\\\\\\\\nthe only hash slots served by A, the count of hash slots served by A will\\\\\\\\ndrop to 0! So A will **reconfigure to be a replica of the new master**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe actual rule followed is a bit more complex than this. In general it may\\\\\\\\nhappen that A rejoins after a lot of time, in the meantime it may happen that\\\\\\\\nhash slots originally served by A are served by multiple nodes, for example\\\\\\\\nhash slot 1 may be served by B, and hash slot 2 by C.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo the actual *Redis Cluster node role switch rule* is: **A master node will change its configuration to replicate (be a replica of) the node that stole its last hash slot**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDuring reconfiguration, eventually the number of served hash slots will drop to zero, and the node will reconfigure accordingly. Note that in the base case this just means that the old master will be a replica of the replica that replaced it after a failover. However in the general form the rule covers all possible cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReplicas do exactly the same: they reconfigure to replicate the node that\\\\\\\\nstole the last hash slot of its former master.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.104,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0e6d33c0\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"0e6d33c0-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_llm_apps/llm_optimization_tools/toonify_token_optimization/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"🎯 Toonify Token Optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🎯 Toonify Token Optimization > 📋 Overview > Key Benefits\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- **💰 63.9% average token reduction** compared to JSON\\\\\\\\n- **🎯 Up to 73.4% savings** for optimal use cases (tabular data)\\\\\\\\n- **💵 Saves $2,147 per million API requests** at GPT-4 pricing\\\\\\\\n- **📖 Human-readable** format\\\\\\\\n- **⚡ Minimal overhead** (<1ms for typical payloads)\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.2423,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"LRM eviction {#lrm-eviction}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with Redis 8.6, the Least Recently Modified (LRM) eviction policy is available.

**异步复制机制**：Redis 使用异步复制，主节点在向客户端返回写入成功响应的同时，才开始向从节点复制数据。这之间存在一个很小的时间窗口。\n\n2. **实际丢失情况**：根据 Redis Cluster 的 failover 测试，在主节点崩溃时可能丢失约 577-578 条写入操作，但**不会产生数据不一致**（inconsistency）。\n\n3. **为什么不常见**：Redis 几乎同时完成\"回复客户端\"和\"复制到从节点\"两个操作，所以丢失数据的窗口期极短，实际触发概率很低。\n\n## 如何保证数据一致性？\n\n### 1. 使用 Sentinel 客户端（关键）\n\n```\n所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\n```\n\n- 使用 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel 等客户端\n- 配置 Sentinel 地址而非直连 master\n- 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\n- 开启 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置\n\n### 2. 自动故障切换\n\n当 Sentinel 检测到主节点故障时：\n- Sentinel 会自动选举新的 master\n- 客户端会自动发现并切换到新 master\n- 通常 30 秒内完成切换\n\n### 3. 定期演练\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster\n```\n\n定期执行 failover 演练，确保应用层能正确处理切换。\n\n### 4. 如果直连 master（不推荐）\n\n需要手动恢复：\n\n```bash\n# 1. 获取新 master 地址\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n\n# 2. 更新应用配置并重启\nkubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\n```\n\n## 故障现象\n\nfailover 发生时的典型表现：\n- 应用日志出现 `READONLY You can't

However the fact that it is hard to trigger does not mean that it\\\\\\\\nis impossible, so this does not change the consistency guarantees provided\\\\\\\\nby Redis cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can now check what is the cluster setup after the failover (note that\\\\\\\\nin the meantime I restarted the crashed instance so that it rejoins the\\\\\\\\ncluster as a replica):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes\\\\\\\\n3fc783611028b1707fd65345e763befb36454d73 127.0.0.1:7004 slave 3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 0 1385503418521 0 connected\\\\\\\\na211e242fc6b22a9427fed61285e85892fa04e08 127.0.0.1:7003 slave 97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 0 1385503419023 0 connected\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 127.0.0.1:7005 master - 0 1385503419023 3 connected 11423-16383\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385503417005 0 connected 5960-10921\\\\\\\\n2938205e12de373867bf38f1ca29d31d0ddb3e46 127.0.0.1:7002 slave 3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 0 1385503418016 3 connected\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow the masters are running on ports 7000, 7001 and 7005.

cluster node is serving a given set of hash slots. This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -2.7326,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"227377d9\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"227377d9-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/multi-key-operations.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Multi-key operations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Pipelines, transactions, and scripts\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"| Behavior | Commands |\\\\\\\\n|----------|----------|\\\\\\\\n| **ROS/RS clustering disabled:**<br>&ndash; the whole DB (single shard)<br><br>**ROS clustering enabled, RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API enabled):**<br>&ndash; the current shard<br><br>**RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API disabled):**<br>&ndash; all shards | FLUSHALL, FLUSHDB |\\\\\\\\n| **ROS/RS clustering disabled:**<br>&ndash; cross-slot<br><br>**ROS clustering enabled, RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API enabled):**<br>&ndash; single-slot<br><br>**RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API disabled):**<br>&ndash; cross-slot (all shards) | DEL, MSET, TOUCH, UNLINK<br><br>Note: on Active-Active, DEL, MSET, and UNLINK are single-slot |\\\\\\\\n| **ROS/RS clustering disabled:**<br>&ndash; cross-slot<br><br>**ROS clustering enabled, RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API enabled), RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API disabled):**<br>&ndash; single-slot | BITOP, BLMOVE, BLMPOP, BLPOP, BRPOP, BRPOPLPUSH, BZMPOP, BZPOPMAX, BZPOPMIN, CMS.MERGE, COPY, GEORADIUS or GEORADIUSBYMEMBER (with STORE or STOREDIST), GEOSEARCHSTORE, JSON.MSET, LMOVE, LMPOP, MSETNX, PFMERGE, RENAME, RENAMENX, RPOPLPUSH, SDIFFSTORE, SINTERSTORE, SMOVE, SUNIONSTORE, TDIGEST.MERGE, TS.MADD, ZDIFFSTORE, ZINTERSTORE, ZMPOP, ZRANGESTORE, ZUNIONSTORE |\\\\\\\\n| **ROS/RS clustering disabled:**<br>&ndash; cross-slot<br><br>**ROS clustering enabled, RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API enabled), RS clustering enabled (OSS cluster API disabled):**<br>&ndash; single-shard | TS.CREATERULE, TS.DELETERULE<br><br>Users won\\'t get a CROSSSLOT error.

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis server 7.2 introduces significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets, several improvements, including encoding improvements for sets and lists, stream consumer group improvements, and improved durability.\\\\\\\\nSearch and Query brings the frequently asked Geo polygons queries for basic shapes and improved query performance on sorting in different scenarios. \\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands: [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) and [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) for more efficient data manipulation.\\\\\\\\nPreview of triggers and functions that allows developers to run JavaScript functions inside the Redis process.\\\\\\\\nLastly, 7.2 adds the option to use the new protocol [RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) improving the response format for all commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis server**:\\\\\\\\nRedis server 7.2 brings performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process. These functions can be executed on-demand, by an event-driven trigger, or by a stream processing trigger. Triggers and functions empowers developers to build and maintain real-time applications by moving logic closer to the data, ensuring a lower latency whilst delivering the best developer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry it out with the [triggers and functions quick start](https://redis.io/docs/interact/programmability/triggers-and-functions/quick_start/).\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.6767,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e37f9728\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e37f9728-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/ai_Self-Evolving_agent/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Create a new conda environment\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🎯 Roadmap\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"We use our framework to optimize existing multi-agent systems on the [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) benchmark.

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

`data` argument which pass to the stream consumer callback are in the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\":

],\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why the record is a list of touples and not an object is because the Redis Stream specifications allows duplicate keys.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotice that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS` `ArrayBuffer`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can observe the streams which are tracked by our registered consumer using `TFUNCTION LIST` command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFUNCTION LIST

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When new `configEpoch` values are created via replica promotion during\\\\\\\\nfailovers, they are guaranteed to be unique.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever there are two distinct events where new configEpoch values are\\\\\\\\ncreated in an unsafe way, just incrementing the local `currentEpoch` of\\\\\\\\nthe local node and hoping there are no conflicts at the same time.\\\\\\\\nBoth the events are system-administrator triggered:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover) command with `TAKEOVER` option is able to manually promote a replica node into a master *without the majority of masters being available*. This is useful, for example, in multi data center setups.\\\\\\\\n2. Migration of slots for cluster rebalancing also generates new configuration epochs inside the local node without agreement for performance reasons.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSpecifically, during manual resharding, when a hash slot is migrated from\\\\\\\\na node A to a node B, the resharding program will force B to upgrade\\\\\\\\nits configuration to an epoch which is the greatest found in the cluster,\\\\\\\\nplus 1 (unless the node is already the one with the greatest configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch), without requiring agreement from other nodes.\\\\\\\\nUsually a real world resharding involves moving several hundred hash slots\\\\\\\\n(especially in small clusters). Requiring an agreement to generate new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration epochs during resharding, for each hash slot moved, is\\\\\\\\ninefficient. Moreover it requires a fsync in each of the cluster nodes\\\\\\\\nevery time in order to store the new configuration. Because of the way it is\\\\\\\\nperformed instead, we only need a new config epoch when the first hash slot is moved,\\\\\\\\nmaking it much more efficient in production environments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever because of the two cases above, it is possible (though unlikely) to end\\\\\\\\nwith multiple nodes having the same configuration epoch. A resharding operation\\\\\\\\nperformed by the system administrator, and a failover happening at the same\\\\\\\\ntime (plus a lot of bad luck) could cause `currentEpoch` collisions if\\\\\\\\nthey are not propagated fast enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, software bugs and filesystem corruptions can also contribute\\\\\\\\nto multiple nodes having the same configuration epoch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen masters serving different hash slots have the same `configEpoch`, there\\\\\\\\nare no issues. It is more important that replicas failing over a master have\\\\\\\\nunique configuration epochs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat said, manual interventions or resharding may change the cluster\\\\\\\\nconfiguration in different ways. The Redis Cluster main liveness property\\\\\\\\nrequires that slot configurations always converge, so under every circumstance\\\\\\\\nwe really want all the master nodes to have a different `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to enforce this, **a conflict resolution algorithm** is used in the\\\\\\\\nevent that two nodes end up with the same `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* IF a master node detects another master node is advertising itself with\\\\\\\\nthe same `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n* AND IF the node has a lexicographically smaller Node ID compared to the other node claiming the same `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n* THEN it increments its `currentEpoch` by 1, and uses it as the new `configEpoch`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf there are any set of nodes with the same `configEpoch`, all the nodes but the one with the greatest Node ID will move forward, guaranteeing that, eventually, every node will pick a unique configEpoch regardless of what happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism also guarantees that after a fresh cluster is created, all\\\\\\\\nnodes start with a different `configEpoch` (even if this is not actually\\\\\\\\nused) since `redis-cli` makes sure to use [`CLUSTER SET-CONFIG-EPOCH`](/commands/cluster-set-config-epoch) at startup.\\\\\\\\nHowever if for some reason a node is left misconfigured, it will update\\\\\\\\nits configuration to a different configuration epoch automatically.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -6.9191,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"See also\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis vector sets are efficient, but vector similarity indexing and graph traversal require memory tradeoffs.

Some applications may require that all queries be served in less than 1 millisecond. For other applications, it may be acceptable for a small amount of clients to experience a 2 second latency on occasion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step to enable the latency monitor is to set a **latency threshold** in milliseconds. Only events that take longer than the specified threshold will be logged as latency spikes. The user should set the threshold according to their needs. For example, if the application requires a maximum acceptable latency of 100 milliseconds, the threshold should be set to log all the events blocking the server for a time equal or greater to 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEnable the latency monitor at runtime in a production server\\\\\\\\nwith the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold 100\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMonitoring is turned off by default (threshold set to 0), even if the actual cost of latency monitoring is near zero. While the memory requirements of latency monitoring are very small, there is no good reason to raise the baseline memory usage of a Redis instance that is working well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe user interface to the latency monitoring subsystem is the [`LATENCY`](/commands/latency) command.\\\\\\\\nLike many other Redis commands, [`LATENCY`](/commands/latency) accepts subcommands that modify its behavior. These subcommands are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY LATEST`](/commands/latency-latest) - returns the latest latency samples for all events.\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY HISTORY`](/commands/latency-history) - returns latency time series for a given event.\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY RESET`](/commands/latency-reset) - resets latency time series data for one or more events.\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY GRAPH`](/commands/latency-graph) - renders an ASCII-art graph of an event\\'s latency samples.\\\\\\\\n* [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) - replies with a human-readable latency analysis report.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRefer to each subcommand\\'s documentation page for further information.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='❌ 未找到相关文档。\\n\\nThe knowledge base does not contain information about setting up Prometheus alerting rules for CPU usage.

In RediSearch 1.x, you had to manually add data to your indexes using the `FT.ADD` command. In RediSearch 2.x, your data is indexed automatically based on a key pattern.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese changes are designed to enhance developer productivity, and to ensure that\\\\\\\\nyour search indexes are always kept in sync with your data. To support this, we\\'ve\\\\\\\\nmade a few changes to the API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition to simplifying indexing, RediSearch 2.0 allows you to scale a single index over multiple Redis shards using the Redis cluster API.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, RediSearch 2.x keeps its indexes outside of the main Redis key space. Improvements to the indexing code have increased query performance 2.4x.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can read more details in [the RediSearch 2.0 announcement blog post](https://redislabs.com/blog/introducing-redisearch-2-0/), and you can get started by checking out this [quick start blog post](https://redislabs.com/blog/getting-started-with-redisearch-2-0/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- When you create an index, you must specify a prefix condition and/or a filter. This determines which hashes RediSearch will index.\\\\\\\\n- Several RediSearch commands now map to their Redis equivalents: `FT.ADD` -> `HSET`, `FT.DEL` -> `DEL` (equivalent to `FT.DEL` with the DD flag in RediSearch 1.x), `FT.GET` -> `HGETALL`, `FT.MGET` -> `HGETALL`.\\\\\\\\n- RediSearch indexes no longer reside within the key space, and the indexes are no longer saved to the RDB.\\\\\\\\n- You can upgrade from RediSearch 1.x to RediSearch 2.x.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='❌ 未找到相关文档。\\n\\n知识库中没有关于 Elasticsearch index mapping 设计的文档。检索结果主要是 RediSearch（Redis 的搜索模块）和本项目的设计文档，与 Elasticsearch 无关。\\n\\n如果你需要了解 Elasticsearch mapping 设计，建议：\\n1. 导入 Elasticsearch 官方文档到知识库\\n2. 或者我可以基于通用知识回答（但不符合知识库检索的防幻觉约束）')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "❌ 未找到相关文档。\n\n知识库中没有关于 Elasticsearch index mapping 设计的文档。检索结果主要是 RediSearch（Redis 的搜索模块）和本项目的设计文档，与 Elasticsearch 无关。\n\n如果你需要了解 Elasticsearch mapping 设计，建议：\n1. 导入 Elasticsearch 官方文档到知识库\n2. 或者我可以基于通用知识回答（但不符合知识库检索的防幻觉约束）", "session_id": "f5a7a94d-536b-4f19-8292-72df5910fb9e", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 134054, "total_cost_usd": 0.044462, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1346, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2692, "cache_read_input_tokens": 33664, "output_tokens": 163, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

It allows for storage of vector embeddings and facilitates fast similarity searches, crucial for retrieving relevant information in RAG.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Popular AI frameworks**: Redis integrates seamlessly with various AI frameworks and tools. For instance, combining Redis with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) or [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/RedisIndexDemo/), libraries for building language models, enables developers to create sophisticated RAG pipelines. These integrations support efficient data management and building real-time LLM chains.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Spring AI and Redis**: Using [Spring AI with Redis](https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/) simplifies building RAG applications. Spring AI provides a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into applications, while Redis handles data management, ensuring the RAG pipeline is efficient and scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Embed and store data**: Convert your data into vector embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., BERT, GPT). Store these embeddings in Redis, where they can be quickly retrieved based on vector searches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Integrate with a generative model**: Use a generative AI model that can leverage the retrieved data. The model will use the vectors stored in Redis to augment its generation process, ensuring the output is informed by relevant, up-to-date information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Query and generate**: Implement the query logic to retrieve relevant vectors from Redis based on the input prompt. Feed these vectors into the generative model to produce augmented outputs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency**: The in-memory data store of Redis ensures that retrieval operations are performed with minimal latency.\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability**: Redis scales horizontally, seamlessly handling growing volumes of data and queries.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures and integrates with AI frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, Redis offers a powerful and efficient platform for implementing RAG. Its vector management capabilities, high performance, and seamless integration with AI frameworks make it an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI applications with real-time data retrieval.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -8.5106,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6a7aea0e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6a7aea0e-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_services_agency/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"AI Services Agency 👨\\u200d💼\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"AI Services Agency 👨\\u200d💼 > How to Run\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:\\\\\\\\nBefore anything else, Please get your OpenAI API Key here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Clone the Repository**:\\\\\\\\n   ```bash\\\\\\\\n   git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\\\\\\\\n   cd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_services_agency\\\\\\\\n   ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Install the dependencies**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Run the Streamlit app**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    streamlit run agency.py\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Enter your OpenAI API Key** in the sidebar when prompted and start analyzing your startup idea!\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -9.5646,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6224b31\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6224b31-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/multimodal_ai_agent/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Readme\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🧬 Multimodal AI Agent\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Streamlit application that combines video analysis and web search capabilities using Google\\'s Gemini 2.5 model.

file using a built-in default\\\\\\\\nconfiguration, however this setup is only recommended for testing and\\\\\\\\ndevelopment purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe proper way to configure Redis is by providing a Redis configuration file,\\\\\\\\nusually called `redis.conf`. Beginning with Redis 8 in Redis Open Source, there are two configuration files:\\\\\\\\n* `redis.conf` - contains the configuration settings for Redis server only.\\\\\\\\n* `redis-full.conf` - contains configuration settings for Redis server and all available components: Redis Query Engine, Redis time series, and Redis probabilistic data structures. This file has as its first line `include redis.conf`, which pulls in the Redis server configuration settings at startup. Use `redis-full.conf` when you want to enable all available components. The file contains four `loadmodule` directives, one for each component, and also loads Redis JSON (though JSON has no configuration parameters).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are building Redis from source and choose to build Redis server without the available components, you can use `redis.conf` as your configuration file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach configuration file contains a number of directives that have a very simple format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    keyword argument1 argument2 ... argumentN\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of a configuration directive:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    replicaof 127.0.0.1 6380\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to provide strings containing spaces as arguments using\\\\\\\\n(double or single) quotes, as in the following example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    requirepass \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello world\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle-quoted string can contain characters escaped by backslashes, and\\\\\\\\ndouble-quoted strings can additionally include any ASCII symbols encoded using\\\\\\\\nbackslashed hexadecimal notation \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xff\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe list of configuration directives, along with comments describing their meaning and intended usage, is available in the self-documented sample\\xa0files `redis.conf`\\xa0and\\xa0`redis-full.conf`\\xa0files shipped with the Redis distributions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Configuration files for Redis 8.6: [redis-full.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.6/redis-full.conf) and [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.6/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration files for Redis 8.4: [redis-full.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.4/redis-full.conf) and [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.4/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration files for Redis 8.2: [redis-full.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.2/redis-full.conf) and [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.2/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration files for Redis 8.0: [redis-full.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.0/redis-full.conf) and [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/8.0/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration file for Redis 7.4: [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.4/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration file for Redis 7.2: [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.2/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration file for Redis 7.0: [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/7.0/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n* Configuration file for Redis 6.2: [redis.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redis/redis/6.2/redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPassing arguments using the command line\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also pass Redis configuration parameters\\\\\\\\nusing the command line directly. This is very useful for testing purposes.\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example that starts a new Redis instance using port 6380\\\\\\\\nas a replica of the instance running at 127.0.0.1 port 6379.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server --port 6380 --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe format of the arguments passed using the command line is exactly the same\\\\\\\\nas the one used in the redis.conf file, with the exception that the keyword\\\\\\\\nis prefixed with `--`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that internally this generates an in-memory temporary config file\\\\\\\\n(possibly concatenating the config file passed by the user, if any) where\\\\\\\\narguments are translated into the format of redis.conf.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChanging Redis configuration while the server is running\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to reconfigure Redis on the fly without stopping and restarting\\\\\\\\nthe service, or querying the current configuration programmatically using the\\\\\\\\nspecial commands [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) and [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNot all of the configuration directives are supported in this way, but most\\\\\\\\nare supported as expected.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) and [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) pages for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that modifying the configuration on the fly does not affect the\\\\\\\\n`redis.conf` and `redis-full.conf` files, so at the next restart of Redis, the old configuration will\\\\\\\\nbe used instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to also modify the configuration files accordingly to the configuration\\\\\\\\nyou set using [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set).\\\\\\\\nYou can do it manually, or you can use [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite), which will automatically scan your configuration files and update the fields that don\\'t match the current configuration value.\\\\\\\\nFields set to the default value are not added.\\\\\\\\nComments inside your configuration file are retained.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfiguring Redis as a cache\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you plan to use Redis as a cache where every key will have an\\\\\\\\nexpire set, you may consider using the following configuration instead\\\\\\\\n(assuming a max memory limit of 2 megabytes as an example):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    maxmemory 2mb\\\\\\\\n    maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration there is no need for the application to set a\\\\\\\\ntime to live for keys using the [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) command (or equivalent) since\\\\\\\\nall the keys will be evicted using an approximated LRU algorithm as long\\\\\\\\nas we hit the 2 megabyte memory limit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically, in this configuration Redis acts in a similar way to memcached.\\\\\\\\nWe have more extensive documentation about using Redis as an LRU cache [here]().\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -7.9484,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"46742e3d\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"46742e3d-006\\\\\",\\\\n

The Sentinel running in the other box S2 will not be able to authorize a failover, so the system will become not available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that a majority is needed in order to order different failovers, and later propagate the latest configuration to all the Sentinels.

\\\\\"Commands accepting a glob-style pattern, including [`KEYS`](/commands/keys), [`SCAN`](/commands/scan) and [`SORT`](/commands/sort), are optimized for patterns that imply a single slot.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if all keys that can match a pattern must belong to a specific slot, only this slot is searched for keys matching the pattern.\\\\\\\\nThe pattern slot optimization is introduced in Redis 8.0.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe optimization kicks in when the pattern meets the following conditions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* the pattern contains a hashtag,\\\\\\\\n* there are no wildcards or escape characters before the hashtag, and\\\\\\\\n* the hashtag within curly braces doesn\\'t contain any wildcards or escape characters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, `SCAN 0 MATCH {abc}*` can successfully recognize the hashtag and scans only the slot corresponding to `abc`.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the patterns `*{abc}`, `{a*c}`, or `{a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*bc}` cannot recognize the hashtag, so all slots need to be scanned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding the hash tags exception, the following is an implementation of the `HASH_SLOT` function in Ruby and C language.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRuby example

let loop complete naturally\\\\\\\\nif event.is_final_response() and event.content:\\\\\\\\n    response_text = event.content.parts[0].text.strip()\\\\\\\\n    # Don\\'t break - let the loop complete to ensure callbacks run\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is a known ADK behavior where breaking the loop early prevents cleanup callbacks from executing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Try Tutorial 6.2: LLM Interaction Callbacks\\\\\\\\n- Experiment with state management between callbacks\\\\\\\\n- Add custom logging or analytics\\\\\\\\n- Implement performance alerts for slow responses\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -5.4644,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9c8c3260\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9c8c3260-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/starter_ai_agents/ai_breakup_recovery_agent/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"💔 Breakup Recovery Agent Team\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"💔 Breakup Recovery Agent Team > 🧑\\u200d💻 Agents Overview\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**👉 [Click here to follow our complete step-by-step tutorial](https://www.theunwindai.com/p/build-an-ai-breakup-recovery-agent-team-f29b) and learn how to build this from scratch with detailed code walkthroughs, explanations, and best practices.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an AI-powered application designed to help users emotionally recover from breakups by providing support, guidance, and emotional outlet messages from a team of specialized AI agents.
