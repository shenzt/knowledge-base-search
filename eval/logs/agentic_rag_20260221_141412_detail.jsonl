For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"agent_hint\\\\\": \\\\\"[overview | gaps:incomplete_steps,missing_example]\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"evidence_flags\\\\\": {\\\\n      \\\\\"has_command\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_config\\\\\": true,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_code_block\\\\\": false,\\\\n      \\\\\"has_steps\\\\\": false\\\\n    }\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": -3.345,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-053\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_index\\\\\": 53,\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"../my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Key API for Sorted Set iterator > `RedisModule_ZsetRangePrev`\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"int RedisModule_ZsetLastInLexRange(RedisModuleKey *key,\\\\\\\\n                                       RedisModuleString *min,\\\\\\\\n                                       RedisModuleString *max);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 4.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExactly like [`RedisModule_ZsetFirstInLexRange()`](#RedisModule_ZsetFirstInLexRange) but the last element of\\\\\\\\nthe range is selected for the start of the iteration instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<span id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"RedisModule_ZsetRangeCurrentElement\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisModuleString *RedisModule_ZsetRangeCurrentElement(RedisModuleKey *key,\\\\\\\\n                                                           double *score);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 4.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReturn the current sorted set element of an active sorted set iterator\\\\\\\\nor NULL if the range specified in the iterator does not include any\\\\\\\\nelement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<span id=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"RedisModule_ZsetRangeNext\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></span>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nint RedisModule_ZsetRangeNext(RedisModuleKey *key);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 4.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGo to the next element of the sorted set iterator.
