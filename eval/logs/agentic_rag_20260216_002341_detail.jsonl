For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3277,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis set is an unordered collection of unique strings (members).\\\\\\\\nYou can use Redis sets to efficiently:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Track unique items (e.g., track all unique IP addresses accessing a given blog post).\\\\\\\\n* Represent relations (e.g., the set of all users with a given role).\\\\\\\\n* Perform common set operations such as intersection, unions, and differences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`SADD`]() adds a new member to a set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SREM`]() removes the specified member from the set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SISMEMBER`]() tests a string for set membership.\\\\\\\\n* [`SINTER`]() returns the set of members that two or more sets have in common (i.e., the intersection).\\\\\\\\n* [`SCARD`]() returns the size (a.k.a. cardinality) of a set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of set commands](?group=set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Store the sets of bikes racing in France and the USA.

For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6694,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Learn more\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* There are two ways we can use a sorted set to represent a leaderboard.

They store sequences of entries, each with field-value pairs, and include built-in support for **consumer groups** to manage multiple readers with at-least-once delivery.\n\n### Key Characteristics\n\n**Structure**: Sequence of entries, each with a set of field-value pairs\n**Operations**: add, read, trim\n**Best for**: Log data, time series, message queues, and append-only structures\n\n### When to Use Streams vs Other Data Types\n\nUse Streams when you need:\n- Timestamp-based ordering of messages\n- Multiple consumers reading from the same sequence\n- Consumer groups for managing multiple readers\n- At-least-once delivery guarantees\n\nIf you don't need consumer groups or timestamp ordering, Lists might be simpler for basic queue operations.\n\n### Basic Commands\n\nWhile the KB doesn't have detailed command documentation, the main Streams commands are:\n\n- **XADD**: Add entries to a stream\n- **XREAD**: Read entries from a stream\n- **XREADGROUP**: Read entries as part of a consumer group\n- **XGROUP**: Manage consumer groups\n\n### Idempotent Message Processing (Redis 8.6+)\n\nRedis 8.6 introduced idempotent message processing to prevent duplicate entries when producers retry:\n\n```redis\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # Manual producer/iid\nXADD mystream IDMPAUTO producer-2 * field value        # Auto-generated iid\n```\n\nThis ensures at-most-once production even when network issues or crashes cause retries.\n\n### Multi-Key Considerations\n\nIn clustered environments, XREAD and XREADGROUP are **single-slot** operations - all stream keys must hash to the same slot. Use hash tags to ensure this:\n\n```redis\nXREAD STREAMS {app}:stream1 {app}:stream2 0-0 0-0\n```\n\n[来源: compare-data-types.md > Data type features > Streams]\n[来源: multi-key-operations.md > Read-only commands]\n[来源: idempotency.md > Idempotency modes]\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The knowledge base doesn't contain the main Redis Streams tutorial with detailed examples of consumer groups, acknowledgments, and pending entries.

not just a matter of RTT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Request/Response server can be implemented so that it is able to process new requests even if the client hasn\\'t already read the old responses.\\\\\\\\nThis way it is possible to send *multiple commands* to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use for many decades.\\\\\\\\nFor instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has supported pipelining since its early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.\\\\\\\\nThis is an example using the raw netcat utility:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash \\\\\\\\n$ (printf \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; sleep 1) | nc localhost 6379\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time we don\\'t pay the cost of RTT for every call, but just once for the three commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be explicit, with pipelining the order of operations of our very first example will be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the client sends commands using pipelining, the server will be forced to queue the replies, using memory. So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_pYBWzjz79d3qzY7jE5Ksyv', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='The search returned information about Redis pipelining, but not specifically about Streams.

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2

Redis data types are closely related to fundamental data structures and are exposed to the programmer as such, without additional abstraction layers.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can\\'t be larger than memory. Another advantage of\\\\\\\\nin-memory databases is that the memory representation of complex data structures\\\\\\\\nis much simpler to manipulate compared to the same data structures on disk, so\\\\\\\\nRedis can do a lot with little internal complexity. At the same time the\\\\\\\\ntwo on-disk storage formats (RDB and AOF) don\\'t need to be suitable for random\\\\\\\\naccess, so they are compact and always generated in an append-only fashion\\\\\\\\n(Even the AOF log rotation is an append-only operation, since the new version\\\\\\\\nis generated from the copy of data in memory). However this design also involves\\\\\\\\ndifferent challenges compared to traditional on-disk stores. Being the main data\\\\\\\\nrepresentation on memory, Redis operations must be carefully handled to make sure\\\\\\\\nthere is always an updated version of the data set on disk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An empty instance uses ~ 3MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 85MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 160 MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting your use case is trivial. Use the `redis-benchmark` utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the `INFO memory` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n64-bit systems will use considerably more memory than 32-bit systems to store the same keys, especially if the keys and values are small. This is because pointers take 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. But of course the advantage is that you can\\\\\\\\nhave a lot of memory in 64-bit systems, so in order to run large Redis servers a 64-bit system is more or less required. The alternative is sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past the Redis developers experimented with Virtual Memory and other systems in order to allow larger than RAM datasets, but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well: data served from memory, disk used for storage. So for now there are no plans to create an on disk backend for Redis. Most of what\\\\\\\\nRedis is, after all, a direct result of its current design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf your real problem is not the total RAM needed, but the fact that you need\\\\\\\\nto split your data set into multiple Redis instances, please read the\\\\\\\\n[partitioning page]() in this documentation for more info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Ltd., the company sponsoring Redis development, has developed a\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis on Flash\\\\\\\\\\\\\" solution that uses a mixed RAM/flash approach for\\\\\\\\nlarger data sets with a biased access pattern.

Redis already supports key expiration. For each key, users can specify a time when it should expire, or specify the remaining time-to-live (TTL) after which it would expire. One very frequent request was to allow specifying expiration time or TTL also for individual hash fields, which is now supported using nine new Redis commands:\\\\\\\\n- `HEXPIRE`, `HPEXPIRE`, `HEXPIREAT`, `HPEXPIREAT` - set the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields. \\\\\\\\n- `HTTL`, `HPTTL`, `HEXPIRETIME`, `HPEXPIRETIME` - retrieve the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields\\\\\\\\n- `HPERSIST` - remove the expiration of specific hash fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Streams`: It is now possible to start reading from the last stream message using `XREAD` with the new id value `+`.\\\\\\\\nThere are many additional improvements, including new command arguments, security, performance, and resource utilization enhancements, several new metrics and configuration parameters were introduced, and multiple bugs were fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Time series`: The latest time series data structure adds a highly requested feature: insertion-filter for close samples. Many sensors report data periodically. Often, the difference between the measured value and the previously measured value is negligible and related to random noise or to measurement accuracy limitations. When both the time difference and the value difference between the current and the previous sample are small, it may be preferable to ignore (not to add) the new measurement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`JSON`: Introduces a fix to avoid duplicating AOF commands multiple times in `JSON.MSET`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Probabilistic`: Now, an error is returned if `CMS.MERGE` results in an overflow or underflow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and query**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- New `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` vector data types reduce memory consumed by vectors while preserving accuracy.\\\\\\\\n- Support for indexing empty and missing values and enhanced developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities.\\\\\\\\n- Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax simpler.\\\\\\\\n- Geospatial search capabilities have been expanded with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, and ergonomics have been improved by providing better reporting of the memory consumed by the index and exposing the Full-text scoring in the aggregation pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf one or more fields of a hash key expire after a query begins (using FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE), Redis does not account for these lazily expired fields. As a result, keys with expired fields may still be included in the query results, leading to potentially incorrect or inconsistent results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Removal of triggers and functions**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Stack 7.4 will no longer include triggers and functions.

It discards some older approaches like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"count-all\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"admit-all-count-some\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in favour of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**count-with-exponential-decay**\\\\\\\\\\\\\" strategy which is biased against mouse (small) flows and has a limited impact on elephant (large) flows. This implementation uses two data structures in tandem: a hash table that holds the probabilistic counts (much like the Count-Min Sketch), and a min heap that holds the `K` items with the highest counts. This ensures high accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms allowed, while keeping memory utilization to a fraction of what is typically required by a Sorted Set. It has the additional benefit of being able to get real time notifications when elements are added or removed from the Top K list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trending hashtags (social media platforms, news distribution networks)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What are the K hashtags people have mentioned the most in the last X hours? \\\\\\\\n- What are the K news with highest read/view count today? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData flow is the incoming social media posts from which you parse out the different hashtags. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`TOPK.LIST`]() command has a time complexity of `O(K*log(k))` so if `K` is small, there is no need to keep a separate set or sorted set of all the hashtags. You can query directly from the Top K itself.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.547,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ce6021d9\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"ce6021d9-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/t-digest.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"t-digest\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Use cases\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The t-digest is a sketch data structure in Redis Open Source for estimating percentiles from a data stream or a large dataset using a compact sketch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt can answer questions like:\\\\\\\\n- Which fraction of the values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- How many values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- What\\'s the highest value that\\'s smaller than *p* percent of the values in the data stream?

This kind of process is costly not just in terms of the processing needed to order those values but also in terms of the space needed to store them.

This feature enables reliable message submission with automatic deduplication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdempotent message processing ensures that handling the same message multiple times produces the same system state as handling it once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeginning with Redis 8.6, streams support idempotent message processing (at-most-once production) to prevent duplicate entries when producers resend messages.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nProducers may need to resend messages under two scenarios:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producer-Redis network issues (disconnection and reconnection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If a disconnection occurs after the producer executes `XADD`, but before it receives the reply, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. The producer crashes and restarts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    If the producer crashes after calling `XADD` but before receiving the reply and marking a message as delivered, after a restart, the producer has no way of knowing if that message was delivered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn both cases, to guarantee that the message is added to the stream, the producer must call `XADD` again with the same message. Without idempotent message processing, a retry may result in a message being delivered twice. With idempotent message processing, producers can guarantee at-most-once production even under such scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA unique ID, called an idempotent ID or *iid*, is associated with each message that is added to a stream. \\\\\\\\nThere are two ways to assign iids:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Producers provide a unique iid for each message. An iid can be some identifier already associated with this message: a transaction ID, a counter, or a UUID.\\\\\\\\n1. Redis generates an iid based on each message’s content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the same message is added to the stream more than once, the same iid would need to be provided by the producer.\\\\\\\\nFor (1), this is the producer’s responsibility, and for (2), Redis will calculate the same iid, as long as the message content hasn’t changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the [`XADD`]() command with idempotency parameters, `IDMP` or `IDMPAUTO`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream IDMP producer-1 iid-1 * field value      # producer-1 (pid) and iid-1 (iid) are provided manually\\\\\\\\nXADD mystream

For example, you can use sorted sets to easily maintain  ordered lists of the highest scores in a massive online game.\\\\\\\\n* Rate limiters. In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string. B and A strings can\\'t be equal since sorted sets only have unique elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with a simple example, we\\'ll add all our racers and the score they got in the first race:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 12 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 10 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see [`ZADD`]() is similar to [`SADD`](), but takes one additional argument\\\\\\\\n(placed before the element to be added) which is the score.\\\\\\\\n[`ZADD`]() is also variadic, so you are free to specify multiple score-value\\\\\\\\npairs, as shown in the example above.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith sorted sets it is trivial to return a list of racers sorted by their\\\\\\\\nscore because actually *they are already sorted*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImplementation note: Sorted sets are implemented via a\\\\\\\\ndual-ported data structure containing both a skip list and a hash table, so\\\\\\\\nevery time we add an element Redis performs an O(log(N)) operation. That\\'s\\\\\\\\ngood, so when we ask for sorted elements, Redis does not have to do any work at\\\\\\\\nall, it\\'s already sorted. Note that the [`ZRANGE`]() order is low to high, while the [`ZREVRANGE`]() order is high to low:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZREVRANGE racer_scores 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: 0 and -1 means from element index 0 to the last element (-1 works\\\\\\\\nhere just as it does in the case of the [`LRANGE`]() command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to return scores as well, using the `WITHSCORES` argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZRANGE racer_scores 0 -1 withscores\\\\\\\\n 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ford\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"6\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sam-Bodden\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"8\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 5) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Norem\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 6) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 7) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Royce\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 8) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"10\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n 9) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Castilla\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n10) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"12\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n11) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Prickett\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n12) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.2131,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"8d8f4284-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Compare data types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Choose a data type > Sequences\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"You would normally store sequences of string or binary data using sorted sets,\\\\\\\\nlists, or streams.

For example, for a desired false positive rate of 0.1% (1 in 1000), error_rate should be set to 0.001.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the number of items you expect having in your filter in total and is trivial when you have a static set but it becomes more challenging when your set grows over time. It\\'s important to get the number right because if you **oversize** - you\\'ll end up wasting memory. If you **undersize**, the filter will fill up and a new one will have to be stacked on top of it (sub-filter stacking). In the cases when a filter consists of multiple sub-filters stacked on top of each other latency for adds stays the same, but the latency for presence checks increases. The reason for this is the way the checks work: a regular check would first be performed on the top (latest) filter and if a negative answer is returned the next one is checked and so on. That\\'s where the added latency comes from.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding an item to a Bloom filter never fails due to the data structure \\\\\\\\\\\\\"filling up\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Instead, the error rate starts to grow. To keep the error close to the one set on filter initialization, the Bloom filter will auto-scale, meaning, when capacity is reached, an additional sub-filter will be created.  \\\\\\\\n The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by `EXPANSION`. If the number of items to be stored in the filter is unknown, we recommend that you use an expansion of 2 or more to reduce the number of sub-filters. Otherwise, we recommend that you use an expansion of 1 to reduce memory consumption. The default expansion value is 2. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n The filter will keep adding more hash functions for every new sub-filter in order to keep your desired error rate. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMaybe you\\'re wondering \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why would I create a smaller filter with a high expansion rate if I know I\\'m going to scale anyway?\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; the answer is: for cases where you need to keep many filters (let\\'s say a filter per user, or per product) and most of them will stay small, but some with more activity will have to scale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you know you\\'re not going to scale use the `NONSCALING` flag because that way the filter will use one hash function less. Just remember that if you ever do reach the initially assigned capacity - your error rate will start to grow.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7903,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1760b768-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Reserving Bloom filters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Consider a bike manufacturer that makes a million different kinds of bikes and you\\'d like to avoid using a duplicate model name in new models.

The Redis implementation uses up to 12 KB of memory and provides a standard error rate of 0.81%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCounting unique items usually requires an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items you want to count, because you need\\\\\\\\nto remember the elements you have already seen in the past in order to avoid\\\\\\\\ncounting them multiple times. However, a set of algorithms exist that trade \\\\\\\\nmemory for precision: they return an estimated measure with a standard error, \\\\\\\\nwhich, in the case of the Redis implementation for HyperLogLog, is less than 1%.\\\\\\\\nThe magic of this algorithm is that you no longer need to use an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items counted, and instead can use a\\\\\\\\nconstant amount of memory; 12k bytes in the worst case, or a lot less if your\\\\\\\\nHyperLogLog (We\\'ll just call them HLL from now) has seen very few elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHLLs in Redis, while technically a different data structure, are encoded\\\\\\\\nas a Redis string, so you can call [`GET`]() to serialize a HLL, and [`SET`]()\\\\\\\\nto deserialize it back to the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConceptually the HLL API is like using Sets to do the same task. You would\\\\\\\\n[`SADD`]() every observed element into a set, and would use [`SCARD`]() to check the\\\\\\\\nnumber of elements inside the set, which are unique since [`SADD`]() will not\\\\\\\\nre-add an existing element.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile you don\\'t really *add items* into an HLL, because the data structure\\\\\\\\nonly contains a state that does not include actual elements, the API is the\\\\\\\\nsame:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time you see a new element, you add it to the count with [`PFADD`]().\\\\\\\\n* When you want to retrieve the current approximation of unique elements added using the [`PFADD`]() command, you can use the [`PFCOUNT`]() command. If you need to merge two different HLLs, the [`PFMERGE`]() command is available. Since HLLs provide approximate counts of unique elements, the result of the merge will give you an approximation of the number of unique elements across both source HLLs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> PFADD bikes Hyperion Deimos Phoebe Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> PFADD commuter_bikes Salacia Mimas Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFMERGE all_bikes bikes commuter_bikes\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT all_bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome examples of use cases for this data structure is counting unique queries\\\\\\\\nperformed by users in a search form every day, number of unique visitors to a web page and other similar cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is also able to perform the union of HLLs, please check the\\\\\\\\n[full documentation]() for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Anonymous unique visits of a web page (SaaS, analytics tools)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- How many unique visits has this page had on this day? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have played this song? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have viewed this video? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nStoring the IP address or any other kind of personal identifier is against the law in some countries, which makes it impossible to get unique visitor statistics on your website.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne HyperLogLog is created per page (video/song) per period, and every IP/identifier is added to it on every visit.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.6531,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"42579dc8-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"HyperLogLog\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Learn more\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* [`PFADD`]() adds an item to a HyperLogLog.\\\\\\\\n* [`PFCOUNT`]() returns an estimate of the number of items in the set.\\\\\\\\n* [`PFMERGE`]() combines two or more HyperLogLogs into one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of HyperLogLog commands](?group=hyperloglog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWriting ([`PFADD`]()) to and reading from ([`PFCOUNT`]()) the HyperLogLog is done in constant time and space.\\\\\\\\nMerging HLLs is O(n), where _n_ is the number of sketches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe HyperLogLog can estimate the cardinality of sets with up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (2^64) members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Redis new data structure: the HyperLogLog](http://antirez.com/news/75) has a lot of details about the data structure and its implementation in Redis.\\\\\\\\n* [Redis HyperLogLog Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MunL8nnwscQ) shows you how to use Redis HyperLogLog data structures to build a traffic heat map.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4457,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis set is an unordered collection of unique strings (members).\\\\\\\\nYou can use Redis sets to efficiently:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Track unique items (e.g., track all unique IP addresses accessing a given blog post).\\\\\\\\n* Represent relations (e.g., the set of all users with a given role).\\\\\\\\n* Perform common set operations such as intersection, unions, and differences.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`SADD`]() adds a new member to a set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SREM`]() removes the specified member from the set.\\\\\\\\n* [`SISMEMBER`]() tests a string for set membership.\\\\\\\\n* [`SINTER`]() returns the set of members that two or more sets have in common (i.e., the intersection).\\\\\\\\n* [`SCARD`]() returns the size (a.k.a. cardinality) of a set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of set commands](?group=set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Store the sets of bikes racing in France and the USA.

数据结构设计\n\n**Lists（链表）**：\n- 简单的字符串值链表\n- 设计用于栈和队列的基本操作\n- 通过 `LPUSH`/`RPUSH` 添加，`LPOP`/`RPOP` 移除\n\n**Streams（流）**：\n- 每个条目包含多个字段-值对的序列\n- 专为日志数据、时间序列等仅追加结构优化\n- 每个条目自动生成唯一 ID（时间戳+序列号）\n\n### 2. 消息消费模式\n\n**Lists**：\n- **简单的生产者-消费者模式**：生产者 `LPUSH`，消费者 `RPOP`\n- **阻塞操作**：`BRPOP`/`BLPOP` 避免轮询，等待新元素到达\n- **消息一旦被 POP 就永久删除**，无法重新消费\n- 多个消费者竞争同一消息（先到先得）\n\n**Streams**：\n- **内置 Consumer Groups（消费者组）支持**\n- **消息确认机制**：消费者需要显式确认（ACK）消息处理完成\n- **至少一次交付保证**：未确认的消息可以重新分配给其他消费者\n- **支持多个消费者组独立消费同一流**\n\n### 3. 消息持久性与重放\n\n**Lists**：\n- 消息被消费后立即删除，**无法重新读取历史消息**\n- 适合一次性处理的任务队列\n\n**Streams**：\n- 消息持久化在流中，**可以从任意位置读取**（包括历史消息）\n- 支持按 ID 范围查询、从最后一条消息开始读取（`XREAD` 使用 `+`）\n- 可以设置保留策略（如按时间或数量裁剪）\n\n### 4. 可靠性保证\n\n**Lists**：\n- 如果消费者在处理消息时崩溃，消息丢失\n- 可以用 `LMOVE`/`BLMOVE` 实现更安全的队列（原子移动到备份列表）\n\n**Streams**：\n- **Pending Entries List（待处理列表）**：跟踪已分配但未确认的消息\n- 消费者崩溃后，其他消费者可以接管未完成的消息\n- 支持消息重试和死信队列模式\n\n### 5. 适用场景\n\n**Lists 适合**：\n- 简单的后台任务队列（如 Sidekiq、Resque）\n- 不需要消息持久化和重放\n- 单一消费者或竞争消费模式\n- 对可靠性要求不高的场景\n\n**Streams 适合**：\n- 需要消息持久化和历史回溯\n- 多消费者协作处理（消费者组）\n- 需要消息确认和故障恢复\n- 日志收集、事件溯源、时间序列数据\n\n## 总结\n\nRedis Lists 是轻量级的队列实现，适合简单场景；Streams 是功能完整的消息流系统，提供消费者组、消息确认、持久化等企业级特性。**如果需要可靠的消息队列，官方推荐使用 Streams 而非 Lists。**\n\n---\n\n**来源**：\n- [Redis Lists 文档](file:///home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md) >

This is better for time series use cases, because they are typically interested in the data during a given time window, rather than a fixed number of samples.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5967,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Basic commands\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists are linked lists of string values.\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are frequently used to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Implement stacks and queues.\\\\\\\\n* Build queue management for background worker systems.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`LPUSH`]() adds a new element to the head of a list; [`RPUSH`]() adds to the tail.\\\\\\\\n* [`LPOP`]() removes and returns an element from the head of a list; [`RPOP`]() does the same but from the tails of a list. \\\\\\\\n* [`LLEN`]() returns the length of a list.\\\\\\\\n* [`LMOVE`]() atomically moves elements from one list to another.\\\\\\\\n* [`LRANGE`]() extracts a range of elements from a list.\\\\\\\\n* [`LTRIM`]() reduces a list to the specified range of elements.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_ICnh8Kzhr4wNBQHfJJlsTu', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Streams consumer groups message queue', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_ICnh8Kzhr4wNBQHfJJlsTu', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4571,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4103dc5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"4103dc5c-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/deprecated-features/triggers-and-functions/concepts/triggers/Stream_Triggers.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Stream triggers\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Register a stream consumer\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Triggers and functions provide an API that allows to register a stream trigger. Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe will see the following line on the Redis log file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n2630021:M 05 Jul 2022 17:13:22.506 * <redisgears_2>

`data` argument which pass to the stream consumer callback are in the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"<ms>\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<seq>\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"<stream name>\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n

],\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why the record is a list of touples and not an object is because the Redis Stream specifications allows duplicate keys.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNotice that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS` `ArrayBuffer`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can observe the streams which are tracked by our registered consumer using `TFUNCTION LIST` command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n127.0.0.1:6379> TFUNCTION LIST

\\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Data Structures**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Hash`: Redis now supports expiration of individual hash fields. Redis already supports key expiration. For each key, users can specify a time when it should expire, or specify the remaining time-to-live (TTL) after which it would expire. One very frequent request was to allow specifying expiration time or TTL also for individual hash fields, which is now supported using nine new Redis commands:\\\\\\\\n- `HEXPIRE`, `HPEXPIRE`, `HEXPIREAT`, `HPEXPIREAT` - set the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields. \\\\\\\\n- `HTTL`, `HPTTL`, `HEXPIRETIME`, `HPEXPIRETIME` - retrieve the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields\\\\\\\\n- `HPERSIST` - remove the expiration of specific hash fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Streams`: It is now possible to start reading from the last stream message using `XREAD` with the new id value `+`.\\\\\\\\nThere are many additional improvements, including new command arguments, security, performance, and resource utilization enhancements, several new metrics and configuration parameters were introduced, and multiple bugs were fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Time series`: The latest time series data structure adds a highly requested feature: insertion-filter for close samples. Many sensors report data periodically. Often, the difference between the measured value and the previously measured value is negligible and related to random noise or to measurement accuracy limitations. When both the time difference and the value difference between the current and the previous sample are small, it may be preferable to ignore (not to add) the new measurement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`JSON`: Introduces a fix to avoid duplicating AOF commands multiple times in `JSON.MSET`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Probabilistic`: Now, an error is returned if `CMS.MERGE` results in an overflow or underflow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and query**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- New `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` vector data types reduce memory consumed by vectors while preserving accuracy.\\\\\\\\n- Support for indexing empty and missing values and enhanced developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities.\\\\\\\\n- Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax simpler.\\\\\\\\n- Geospatial search capabilities have been expanded with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, and ergonomics have been improved by providing better reporting of the memory consumed by the index and exposing the Full-text scoring in the aggregation pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf one or more fields of a hash key expire after a query begins (using FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE), Redis does not account for these lazily expired fields. As a result, keys with expired fields may still be included in the query results, leading to potentially incorrect or inconsistent results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Removal of triggers and functions**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Stack 7.4 will no longer include triggers and functions.

For instance \"Python Lists\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\n   118→Lists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\n   119→Ruby actually).\\n   120→\\n   121→From a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\n   122→elements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\n   123→an Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\n   124→*Linked List*.\\n   125→\\n   126→Redis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\n   127→millions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\n   128→the head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\n   129→new element with the [`LPUSH`]({{< relref \"/commands/lpush\" >}}) command to the head of a list with ten\\n   130→elements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\n   131→million elements.\\n   132→\\n   133→What\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\n   134→implemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\n   135→lists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\n   136→work proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\n   137→\\n   138→Redis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\n   139→is crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\n   140→Another strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\n   141→taken at constant length in constant time.\\n   142→\\n   143→When fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\n   144→there is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\n   145→Sorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]({{< relref \"/develop/data-types/sorted-sets\" >}}) tutorial page.\\n   146→\\n   147→### First steps with Redis Lists\\n   148→\\n   149→The [`LPUSH`]({{< relref \"/commands/lpush\" >}}) command adds a new element into a list, on the\\n   150→left (at the head), while the [`RPUSH`]({{< relref \"/commands/rpush\" >}}) command adds a new\\n   151→element into a list, on the right (at the tail).

Redis already supports key expiration. For each key, users can specify a time when it should expire, or specify the remaining time-to-live (TTL) after which it would expire. One very frequent request was to allow specifying expiration time or TTL also for individual hash fields, which is now supported using nine new Redis commands:\\\\\\\\n- `HEXPIRE`, `HPEXPIRE`, `HEXPIREAT`, `HPEXPIREAT` - set the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields. \\\\\\\\n- `HTTL`, `HPTTL`, `HEXPIRETIME`, `HPEXPIRETIME` - retrieve the time when specific hash fields should expire, or the remaining time-to-live for specific fields\\\\\\\\n- `HPERSIST` - remove the expiration of specific hash fields.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Streams`: It is now possible to start reading from the last stream message using `XREAD` with the new id value `+`.\\\\\\\\nThere are many additional improvements, including new command arguments, security, performance, and resource utilization enhancements, several new metrics and configuration parameters were introduced, and multiple bugs were fixed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Time series`: The latest time series data structure adds a highly requested feature: insertion-filter for close samples. Many sensors report data periodically. Often, the difference between the measured value and the previously measured value is negligible and related to random noise or to measurement accuracy limitations. When both the time difference and the value difference between the current and the previous sample are small, it may be preferable to ignore (not to add) the new measurement.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`JSON`: Introduces a fix to avoid duplicating AOF commands multiple times in `JSON.MSET`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n`Probabilistic`: Now, an error is returned if `CMS.MERGE` results in an overflow or underflow.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and query**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- New `BFLOAT16` and `FLOAT16` vector data types reduce memory consumed by vectors while preserving accuracy.\\\\\\\\n- Support for indexing empty and missing values and enhanced developer experience for queries with exact matching capabilities.\\\\\\\\n- Developers can now match `TAG` fields without needing to escape special characters, making the onboarding process and use of the query syntax simpler.\\\\\\\\n- Geospatial search capabilities have been expanded with new `INTERSECT` and `DISJOINT` operators, and ergonomics have been improved by providing better reporting of the memory consumed by the index and exposing the Full-text scoring in the aggregation pipeline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf one or more fields of a hash key expire after a query begins (using FT.SEARCH or FT.AGGREGATE), Redis does not account for these lazily expired fields.

Do not get confused with [Redis streams consumer groups](), triggers and functions uses the Redis Module API to efficiently read the stream and manage its consumers. This approach gives a much better performance as there is no need to invoke any Redis commands in order to read from the stream. Lets see a simple example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```js\\\\\\\\n#!js api_version=1.0 name=myFirstLibrary\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nredis.registerStreamTrigger(\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"consumer\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // consumer name\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"stream\\\\\\\\\\\\\", // streams prefix\\\\\\\\n    function(c, data) {\\\\\\\\n        // callback to run on each element added to the stream\\\\\\\\n        redis.log(JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) =>\\\\\\\\n            typeof value === \\'bigint\\'\\\\\\\\n                ? value.toString()\\\\\\\\n                : value // return everything else unchanged\\\\\\\\n        ));\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArgument Description:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* consumer - the consumer name.\\\\\\\\n* stream - streams name prefix on which to trigger the callback.\\\\\\\\n* callback - the callback to invoke on each element in the stream. Following the same rules of [sync and async invocation](). The callback will be invoke only on primary shard.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf we register this library (see the [quick start]() section to learn how to Register a RedisGears function) and run the following command on our Redis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:1 * foo2 bar2\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo1 bar1\\\\\\\\nXADD stream:2 * foo2

that `stream_name` and `record` fields might contains `null`\\'s if the data can not be decoded as string. the `*_raw` fields will always be provided and will contains the data as `JS`

You can operate on anything from unsigned 1-bit integers to signed 63-bit integers, all stored efficiently in a compact binary format.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Atomic operations**: Support atomic read, write, and increment operations\n- **Flexible bit widths**: Handle integers from 1-bit to 63-bit\n- **Multiple operations**: Can perform multiple bitfield operations in a single command\n- **Efficient storage**: Uses binary-encoded strings for compact memory usage\n\n## When to Use Them\n\nBitfields are ideal for **managing counters and numerical values**, especially when you need:\n\n1. **Multiple related counters per key** - Store several metrics together efficiently\n2. **Atomic updates** - Ensure thread-safe counter operations\n3. **Space efficiency** - Pack multiple values into a single Redis key\n\n## Practical Example\n\nHere's a real-world scenario from the documentation - tracking bicycle statistics (price and number of owners):\n\n```redis\n# Set initial price to 1000 at offset 0\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats SET u32 #0 1000\n1) (integer) 0\n\n# Decrease price by 50, increment owner count\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 -50 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 950\n2) (integer) 1\n\n# Increase price by 500, increment owner count again\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 500 INCRBY u32 #1 1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n\n# Read both values\n> BITFIELD bike:1:stats GET u32 #0 GET u32 #1\n1) (integer) 1450\n2) (integer) 2\n```\n\n## Available Commands\n\n- `BITFIELD` - Atomically sets, increments, and reads one or more values\n- `BITFIELD_RO` - Read-only variant of BITFIELD\n\n## Performance\n\n`BITFIELD` has O(n) complexity, where n is the number of counters accessed.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitfields.md > Performance]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitfields.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitmaps.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["field", "bitfield", "counter", "integer"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitfields.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/compare-data-types.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitmaps.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "bc46e63c-dfc5-440f-b28c-d3f072388775", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "55fdb0fc-bbd9-4cb9-8dd7-4f514cf6ebed", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about Redis Bitfields using both keyword search and semantic search to get comprehensive results.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_vafMGpOXNT2BOoe0HpTiPp', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'bitfield'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_EylLwRG0gsbZWjYQS6uuWa', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Bitfields data type usage examples', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_vafMGpOXNT2BOoe0HpTiPp', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_EylLwRG0gsbZWjYQS6uuWa', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.7087,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a0bd081\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a0bd081-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/bitfields.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis bitfields\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis bitfields let you set, increment, and get integer values of arbitrary bit length.\\\\\\\\nFor example, you can operate on anything from unsigned 1-bit integers to signed 63-bit integers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThese values are stored using binary-encoded Redis strings.\\\\\\\\nBitfields support atomic read, write and increment operations, making them a good choice for managing counters and similar numerical values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`BITFIELD`]() atomically sets, increments and reads one or more values.\\\\\\\\n* [`BITFIELD_RO`]() is a read-only variant of [`BITFIELD`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSuppose you want to maintain two metrics for various bicycles: the current price and the number of owners over time.

Redis data types are closely related to fundamental data structures and are exposed to the programmer as such, without additional abstraction layers.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can\\'t be larger than memory. Another advantage of\\\\\\\\nin-memory databases is that the memory representation of complex data structures\\\\\\\\nis much simpler to manipulate compared to the same data structures on disk, so\\\\\\\\nRedis can do a lot with little internal complexity. At the same time the\\\\\\\\ntwo on-disk storage formats (RDB and AOF) don\\'t need to be suitable for random\\\\\\\\naccess, so they are compact and always generated in an append-only fashion\\\\\\\\n(Even the AOF log rotation is an append-only operation, since the new version\\\\\\\\nis generated from the copy of data in memory). However this design also involves\\\\\\\\ndifferent challenges compared to traditional on-disk stores. Being the main data\\\\\\\\nrepresentation on memory, Redis operations must be carefully handled to make sure\\\\\\\\nthere is always an updated version of the data set on disk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An empty instance uses ~ 3MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 85MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 160 MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting your use case is trivial. Use the `redis-benchmark` utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the `INFO memory` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n64-bit systems will use considerably more memory than 32-bit systems to store the same keys, especially if the keys and values are small. This is because pointers take 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. But of course the advantage is that you can\\\\\\\\nhave a lot of memory in 64-bit systems, so in order to run large Redis servers a 64-bit system is more or less required. The alternative is sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past the Redis developers experimented with Virtual Memory and other systems in order to allow larger than RAM datasets, but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well: data served from memory, disk used for storage. So for now there are no plans to create an on disk backend for Redis. Most of what\\\\\\\\nRedis is, after all, a direct result of its current design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf your real problem is not the total RAM needed, but the fact that you need\\\\\\\\nto split your data set into multiple Redis instances, please read the\\\\\\\\n[partitioning page]() in this documentation for more info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Ltd., the company sponsoring Redis development, has developed a\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis on Flash\\\\\\\\\\\\\" solution that uses a mixed RAM/flash approach for\\\\\\\\nlarger data sets with a biased access pattern.

bikes:rentable -122.27652 37.805186 station:1\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2674626 37.8062344 station:2\nGEOADD bikes:rentable -122.2469854 37.8104049 station:3\n```\n\n**Note:** Longitude comes before latitude with this command.\n\n## Querying Geospatial Data\n\nUse `GEOSEARCH` to find locations within a radius or bounding box:\n\n```redis\nGEOSEARCH bikes:rentable FROMLONLAT -122.2612767 37.7936847 BYRADIUS 5 km WITHDIST\n```\n\nThis returns locations within 5km of the specified coordinates along with their distances:\n\n```\n1) 1) \"station:1\"\n   2) \"1.8523\"\n2) 1) \"station:2\"\n   2) \"1.4979\"\n3) 1) \"station:3\"\n   2) \"2.2441\"\n```\n\n## Advanced: Geospatial Polygons (Redis Stack 7.2+)\n\nFor more complex shapes, Redis Stack 7.2 introduced **GEOSHAPE** field type supporting polygon queries:\n\n- Create an index with `GEOSHAPE` field type using WKT notation\n- Supports `POLYGON` and `POINT` shapes\n- Query with operators like `WITHIN` and `CONTAINS`\n- Works with both cartesian (X,Y) and geographic (lon, lat) coordinate systems\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Finding nearby points of interest (restaurants, stores, bike stations)\n- Location-based services within a radius\n- Proximity searches\n\n[Source: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/geospatial.md]\n\n[Additional context:

performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack.

Geographic coordinate system using spherical indexing as default (`SPHERICAL`).\\\\\\\\n  * [#3046](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3046) Introduce performance optimization for sorting operations on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` as default on `DIALECT 4`. It will improve performance in 4 different scenarios, listed below:\\\\\\\\n    * Skip Sorter - applied when there is no sort of any kind. The query can return once it reaches the `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * Partial Range - applied when there is a `SORTBY` a numeric field, with no filter or filter by the same numeric field, the query iterate on a range large enough to satisfy the `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * Hybrid - applied when there is a `SORTBY` a numeric field in addition to another non-numeric filter. Some results will get filtered, and the initial range may not be large enough. The iterator then is rewinded with the following ranges, and an additional iteration takes place to collect `LIMIT` requested results.\\\\\\\\n    * No optimization - If there is a sort by score or by non-numeric field, there is no other option but to retrieve all results and compare their values.\\\\\\\\n    * [#3651](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch/pull/3651) Add `WITHCOUNT` argument that allow return accurate counts for the query results with sorting. This operation processes all results in order to get accurate count, being less performant than the optimised option (default behaviour on `DIALECT 4`).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **JSON**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#916](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/916) Introduce the new `JSON.MERGE` in compliance with [RFC 7396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396), supporting:\\\\\\\\n    * Creating new attributes on an existing JSON document\\\\\\\\n    * Updating and replacing values in parent and child attributes\\\\\\\\n    * Deleting existing attributes (giving `null` as value)\\\\\\\\n    * Array update - replacing an entire array with the new value.\\\\\\\\n  * [#944](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON/pull/944) Introduce `JSON.MSET`, supporting atomic multiple sets for keys in the same hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Triggers and Functions**:\\\\\\\\n  * [#875](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/875) The api_version was added to the library prologue indicating the minimum required API version. Indicating the library works on the specified API version and later minor versions.\\\\\\\\n[#896](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/896) Additional optional callback on a KeySpace trigger that can perform read operations exactly when the notification happens.\\\\\\\\n  * [#910](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/910) The JavaScript API is updated to be inline with JavaScript best practices. Registrations of functions and triggers is done with mandatory arguments and a single optional object.\\\\\\\\n  * [#935](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/935) Ability to load an RDB from a Redis Server with the RedisGears module loaded but NOT used into a Redis Server without the RedisGears module.\\\\\\\\n  * Updated commands:\\\\\\\\n    * [#910](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/910) `TFUNCTION` and `TFCALL` is used instead of `RG.FUNCTION` and `RG.FCALL`.\\\\\\\\n    * [#939](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/939) The commands are updated to match the Redis Functions commands. `TFCALL` combines the library and function in a single argument with \\'.\\' separated. Example: `TFCALL <library_name>.<function_name>`.\\\\\\\\n    * [#900](https://github.com/RedisGears/RedisGears/pull/900) rated the ability to run functions as a coroutine in `TFCALLASYNC`.

center)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern data centers have a lot of moving pieces, such as infrastructure (servers and networks) and software systems (applications and services) that need to be monitored around the clock.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Time Series allows you to plan for new resources upfront, optimize the utilization of existing resources, reconstruct the circumstances that led to outages, and identify application performance issues by analyzing and reporting on the following metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Maximum CPU utilization per server\\\\\\\\n- Maximum network latency between two services\\\\\\\\n- Average IO bandwidth utilization of a storage system\\\\\\\\n- 99th percentile of the response time of a specific application outages\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Weather analysis (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Time Series can be used to track environmental measurements such as the number of daily sunshine hours and hourly rainfall depth, over a period of many years. Seasonally, you can measure average rainfall depth, average daily temperature, and the maximum number of sunny hours per day, for example. Watch the increase of the maximum daily temperature over the years. Predict the expected temperature and rainfall depth in a specific location for a particular week of the year.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMultiple time series can be collected, each for a different location. By utilizing secondary indexes, measurements can be aggregated over given geographical regions (e.g., minimal and maximal daily temperature in Europe) or over locations with specific attributes (e.g., average rainfall depth in mountainous regions).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample metrics include: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Rain (cm)\\\\\\\\n- Temperature (C)\\\\\\\\n- Sunny periods (h)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Analysis of the atmosphere (environment)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe atmospheric concentration of CO2 is more important than ever before. Use TimeSeries to track average, maximum and minimum CO2 level per season and average yearly CO2 over the last decades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Concentration of CO2 (ppm)\\\\\\\\n- Location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Flight data recording (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlanes have a multitude of sensors. This sensor data is stored in a black box and also shared with external systems. TimeSeries can help you reconstruct the sequence of events over time, optimize operations and maintenance intervals, improve safety, and provide feedback to the equipment manufacturers about the part quality. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Altitude\\\\\\\\n- Flight path\\\\\\\\n- Engine temperature\\\\\\\\n- Level of vibrations\\\\\\\\n- Pressure\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Ship logbooks (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s very common to keep track of ship voyages via (digital) logbooks. Use TimeSeries to calculate optimal routes using these metrics:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Wind (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Ocean conditions (classes)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (knots)\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Connected car (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern cars are exposing several metrics via a standard interface. Use TimeSeries to correlate average fuel consumption with the tire pressure, figure out how long to keep a car in the fleet, determine optimal maintenance intervals, and calculate tax savings by type of the road (taxable vs. nontaxable roads). Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Acceleration\\\\\\\\n- Location (long, lat)\\\\\\\\n- Fuel level (liter)\\\\\\\\n- Distances (km)\\\\\\\\n- Speed (km/h)\\\\\\\\n- Tire pressure\\\\\\\\n- Distance until next maintenance check\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Smart metering (sensor data and IoT)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern houses and facilities gather details about energy consumption/production. Use Redis Time Series to aggregate billing based on monthly consumption. Optimize the network by redirecting the energy delivery relative to the fluctuations in need. Provide recommendations on how to improve the energy consumption behavior. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Consumption per location\\\\\\\\n- Produced amount of electrical energy per location\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Quality of service (telecom)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMobile phone usage is increasing, producing a natural growth that just correlates to the increasing number of cellphones. However, there might also be spikes that correlate with specific events (for example, more messages around world championships). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTelecom providers need to ensure that they are providing the necessary infrastructure to deliver the right quality of service. This includes using mini towers for short-term peaks. Use TimeSeries to correlate traffic peaks to specific events, load balance traffic over several towers or mini towers, and predictively plan the infrastructure. Metrics include the amount of traffic per tower.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Stock trading (finance)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStock trading is highly automated today. Algorithms, and not just human beings, are trading, from the amount of bids and asks for the trading of a stock to the extreme volumes of trades per second (millions of ops per second). Computer-driven trading requires millisecond response times. It\\'s necessary to keep a lot of data points within a very short period of time (for example, price fluctuations per second within a minute). In addition, the long-term history needs to be kept to make statements about trends or for regulatory purposes.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse Redis Time Series to identify correlations between the trading behavior and other events (for example, social network posts). Discover a developing market. Detect anomalies to discover insider trades. Example metrics include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Exact time and order of a trade by itself\\\\\\\\n- Type of the event (trade/bid)\\\\\\\\n- The stock price\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7569,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redistimeseries 1.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.0.0 (June 2019) > Features > Integrations\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If you want to keep all of your raw data points indefinitely, your data set will grow linearly over time. However, if your use case allows you to have less fine-grained data further back in time, downsampling can be applied. This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function. RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using Redis’ core data structures, you can only retrieve a time series by knowing the exact key holding the time series. Unfortunately, for many time series use cases (such as root cause analysis or monitoring), your application won’t know the exact key it’s looking for. These use cases typically want to query a set of time series that relate to each other in a couple of dimensions to extract the insight you need. You could create your own secondary index with core Redis data structures to help with this, but it would come with a high development cost and require you to manage edge cases to make sure the index is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries does this indexing for you based on `field value` pairs (a.k.a labels) you can add to each time series, and use to filter at query time (a full list of these filters is available in our documentation). Here’s an example of creating a time series with two labels (sensor_id and area_id are the fields with values 2 and 32 respectively) and a retention window of 60,000 milliseconds:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to query a time series, it’s cumbersome to stream all raw data points if you’re only interested in, say, an average over a given time interval.

Redis has special list commands to make this use case both more reliable and efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example both the popular Ruby libraries [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) and\\\\\\\\n[sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) use Redis lists under the hood in order to\\\\\\\\nimplement background jobs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe popular Twitter social network [takes the latest tweets](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Real-Time-Delivery-Twitter)\\\\\\\\nposted by users into Redis lists.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo describe a common use case step by step, imagine your home page shows the latest\\\\\\\\nphotos published in a photo sharing social network and you want to speedup access.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time a user posts a new photo, we add its ID into a list with [`LPUSH`]().\\\\\\\\n* When users visit the home page, we use `LRANGE 0 9` in order to get the latest 10 posted items.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn many use cases we just want to use lists to store the *latest items*,\\\\\\\\nwhatever they are: social network updates, logs, or anything else.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis allows us to use lists as a capped collection, only remembering the latest\\\\\\\\nN items and discarding all the oldest items using the [`LTRIM`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`LTRIM`]() command is similar to [`LRANGE`](), but **instead of displaying the\\\\\\\\nspecified range of elements** it sets this range as the new list value. All\\\\\\\\nthe elements outside the given range are removed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you\\'re adding bikes on the end of a list of repairs, but only\\\\\\\\nwant to worry about the 3 that have been on the list the longest:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs 0 2\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above [`LTRIM`]() command tells Redis to keep just list elements from index\\\\\\\\n0 to 2, everything else will be discarded. This allows for a very simple but\\\\\\\\nuseful pattern: doing a List push operation + a List trim operation together \\\\\\\\nto add a new element and discard elements exceeding a limit. Using \\\\\\\\n[`LTRIM`]() with negative indexes can then be used to keep only the 3 most recently added:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:repairs\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> RPUSH bikes:repairs bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> LTRIM bikes:repairs -3 -1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> LRANGE bikes:repairs 0 -1\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above combination adds new elements and keeps only the 3\\\\\\\\nnewest elements into the list. With [`LRANGE`]() you can access the top items\\\\\\\\nwithout any need to remember very old data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: while [`LRANGE`]() is technically an O(N) command, accessing small ranges\\\\\\\\ntowards the head or the tail of the list is a constant time operation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.3259,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6072bd82-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/release-notes/redistimeseries/redistimeseries-1.0-release-notes.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redistimeseries 1.0 Release Notes\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"v1.0.0 (June 2019) > Features\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In RedisTimeSeries, we are introducing a new data type that uses chunks of memory of fixed size for time series samples, indexed by the same [Radix Tree implementation](https://github.com/antirez/rax) as Redis Streams.

However, if your use case allows you to have less fine-grained data further back in time, downsampling can be applied. This allows you to keep fewer historical data points by aggregating raw data for a given time window using a given aggregation function. RedisTimeSeries supports downsampling with the following aggregations: avg, sum, min, max, range, count, first and last.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen using Redis’ core data structures, you can only retrieve a time series by knowing the exact key holding the time series. Unfortunately, for many time series use cases (such as root cause analysis or monitoring), your application won’t know the exact key it’s looking for. These use cases typically want to query a set of time series that relate to each other in a couple of dimensions to extract the insight you need. You could create your own secondary index with core Redis data structures to help with this, but it would come with a high development cost and require you to manage edge cases to make sure the index is correct.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedisTimeSeries does this indexing for you based on `field value` pairs (a.k.a labels) you can add to each time series, and use to filter at query time (a full list of these filters is available in our documentation). Here’s an example of creating a time series with two labels (sensor_id and area_id are the fields with values 2 and 32 respectively) and a retention window of 60,000 milliseconds:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```sh\\\\\\\\nTS.CREATE temperature RETENTION 60000 LABELS sensor_id 2 area_id 32\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you need to query a time series, it’s cumbersome to stream all raw data points if you’re only interested in, say, an average over a given time interval.

They have overlapping functionality but serve different use cases.\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### Purpose\n- **Count-Min Sketch**: Estimates frequency counts for *any* element you query, useful when you need to track counts across many elements\n- **Top-K**: Maintains only the K elements with highest counts, ideal when you only care about the most frequent items\n\n### Data Structure\n- **Count-Min Sketch**: Hash table with probabilistic counters (similar to a 2D array with multiple hash functions)\n- **Top-K**: Combination of a hash table (for probabilistic counts) + min heap (holding the K highest-count items)\n\n### Algorithm\n- **Count-Min Sketch**: Standard CMS algorithm with configurable error rate and probability\n- **Top-K**: Based on HeavyKeepers algorithm with \"count-with-exponential-decay\" strategy, biased against small flows\n\n### Query Capabilities\n- **Count-Min Sketch**: Query frequency of *any* element via `CMS.QUERY`\n- **Top-K**: Only tracks the top K items; can check if an item is in top-K via `TOPK.QUERY` and list all top-K items via `TOPK.LIST`\n\n### Accuracy Threshold\n- **Count-Min Sketch**: Results below `threshold = error × total_count` should be ignored as noise. Only reliable for high-frequency elements\n- **Top-K**: High accuracy for the K highest-frequency items specifically\n\n### Deletions\n- **Count-Min Sketch**: No deletion support (counters only increment)\n- **Top-K**: Items automatically removed from top-K list when displaced by higher-frequency items; supports real-time notifications\n\n## When to Use Each\n\n### Use Count-Min Sketch when:\n- You need to query frequencies of many different elements\n- You want to track sales volume across thousands of products\n- You need approximate counts above a certain threshold\n- Example: \"What was the sales volume for product X on a given day?\"\n\n### Use Top-K when:\n- You only care about the most frequent K items\n- You need real-time updates when items enter/leave the top-K\n- You want to detect anomalies (e.g., DDoS attacks, trending hashtags)\n- Example: \"What are the 10 most-viewed videos today?\" or \"Which IP addresses are sending the most requests?\"\n\n## Performance\n- **Count-Min Sketch**: Optimized for frequent insertions and queries\n- **Top-K**: Faster execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms, with `TOPK.LIST` having O(K×log(k)) complexity\n\n## Overlap\nAs noted in the documentation: \"There is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases.\"\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/top-k.md > Use case]\n[来源:

score can be a count of how many times the element has appeared in the stream - thus making the data structure perfect for finding the elements with the highest frequency in a stream.\\\\\\\\nOne very common application is detecting network anomalies and DDoS attacks where Top K can answer the question: Is there a sudden increase in the flux of requests to the same address or from the same IP?\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere is, indeed, some overlap with the functionality of Count-Min Sketch, but the two data structures have their differences and should be applied for different use cases. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Open Source implementation of Top-K is based on the [HeavyKeepers](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/gong) algorithm presented by Junzhi Gong et al. It discards some older approaches like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"count-all\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"admit-all-count-some\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in favour of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"**count-with-exponential-decay**\\\\\\\\\\\\\" strategy which is biased against mouse (small) flows and has a limited impact on elephant (large) flows. This implementation uses two data structures in tandem: a hash table that holds the probabilistic counts (much like the Count-Min Sketch), and a min heap that holds the `K` items with the highest counts. This ensures high accuracy with shorter execution times than previous probabilistic algorithms allowed, while keeping memory utilization to a fraction of what is typically required by a Sorted Set. It has the additional benefit of being able to get real time notifications when elements are added or removed from the Top K list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Trending hashtags (social media platforms, news distribution networks)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What are the K hashtags people have mentioned the most in the last X hours? \\\\\\\\n- What are the K news with highest read/view count today? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nData flow is the incoming social media posts from which you parse out the different hashtags. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`TOPK.LIST`]() command has a time complexity of `O(K*log(k))` so if `K` is small, there is no need to keep a separate set or sorted set of all the hashtags. You can query directly from the Top K itself.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.4181,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/count-min-sketch.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-min sketch\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-Min Sketch is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Open Source that can be used to estimate the frequency of events/elements in a stream of data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt uses a sub-linear space at the expense of over-counting some events due to collisions. It consumes a stream of events/elements and keeps estimated counters of their frequency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is very important to know that the results coming from a Count-Min sketch lower than a certain threshold (determined by the error_rate) should be ignored and often even approximated to zero. So Count-Min sketch is indeed a data-structure for counting frequencies of elements in a stream, but it\\'s only useful for higher counts. Very low counts should be ignored as noise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Products (retail, online shops)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers this question: What was the sales volume (on a certain day) for a product? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse one Count-Min sketch created per day (period). Every product sale goes into the CMS. The CMS give reasonably accurate results for the products that contribute the most toward the sales. Products with low percentage of the total sales are ignored.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAssume you select an error rate of 0.1% (0.001) with a certainty of 99.8% (0.998). This means you have an error probability of 0.02% (0.002). Your sketch strives to keep the error within 0.1% of the total count of all elements you\\'ve added. There\\'s a 0.02% chance the error might exceed this—like when an element below the threshold overlaps with one above it. When you add a few items to the CMS and evaluate their frequency, remember that in such a small sample, collisions are rare, as seen with other probabilistic data structures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INITBYPROB bikes:profit 0.001 0.002\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 100\\\\\\\\n(integer) 100\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INCRBY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 200 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 150\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n> CMS.QUERY bikes:profit \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Smokey Mountain Striker\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rocky Mountain Racer\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cloudy City Cruiser\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Terrible Bike Name\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 100\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 200\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 150\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> CMS.INFO bikes:profit\\\\\\\\n1) width\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 2000\\\\\\\\n3) depth\\\\\\\\n4) (integer) 9\\\\\\\\n5) count\\\\\\\\n6) (integer) 450\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7685,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"5f323784-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/count-min-sketch.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Count-min sketch\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sizing > 2.

The correlation is:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nthreshold = error * total_count \\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nor\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nerror = threshold/total_count\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nwhere `total_count` is the sum of the count of all elements that can be obtained from the `count` key of the result of the [`CMS.INFO`]() command and is of course dynamic - it changes with every new increment in the sketch.

It can be used to answer the following questions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- What fraction of the values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- How many values in the data stream are smaller than a given value?\\\\\\\\n- Which value is smaller than _p_ percent of the values in the data stream? (what is the _p_-percentile value)?\\\\\\\\n- What is the mean value between the _p1_-percentile value and the _p2_-percentile value?\\\\\\\\n- What is the value of the _n_-th smallest / largest value in the data stream? (what is the value with [reverse] rank _n_)?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs for any other probabilistic data structures, t-digest requires sublinear space and has controllable space-accuracy tradeoffs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing t-digest is simple and straightforward:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Creating a sketch and adding observations**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.CREATE key [COMPRESSION compression]` initializes a new t-digest sketch (and errors if the key already exists). The `COMPRESSION` argument is used to specify the tradeoff between accuracy and memory consumption. The default is 100. Higher values mean more accuracy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.ADD key value...` adds new observations (floating-point values) to the sketch. You can repeat calling [TDIGEST.ADD]() whenever new observations are available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating fractions or ranks by values**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.CDF key value...` to retrieve, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **fraction** of (observations **smaller** than the given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.RANK key value...` is similar to [TDIGEST.CDF](), but used for estimating the number of observations instead of the fraction of observations. More accurately it returns, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **number** of (observations **smaller** than a given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  And lastly, `TDIGEST.REVRANK key value...` is similar to [TDIGEST.RANK](), but returns, for each input **value**, an estimation of the **number** of (observations **larger** than a given value + half the observations equal to the given value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating values by fractions or ranks**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.QUANTILE key fraction...` returns, for each input **fraction**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) that is **smaller** than the given fraction of observations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.BYRANK key rank...` returns, for each input **rank**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) with that rank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  `TDIGEST.BYREVRANK key rank...` returns, for each input **reverse rank**, an estimation of the **value** (floating point) with that reverse rank.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Estimating trimmed mean**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Use `TDIGEST.TRIMMED_MEAN key lowFraction highFraction` to retrieve an estimation of the mean value between the specified fractions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  This is especially useful for calculating the average value ignoring outliers. For example, calculating the average value between the 20th percentile and the 80th percentile.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Merging sketches**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  Sometimes it is useful to merge sketches.

The Redis implementation uses up to 12 KB of memory and provides a standard error rate of 0.81%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCounting unique items usually requires an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items you want to count, because you need\\\\\\\\nto remember the elements you have already seen in the past in order to avoid\\\\\\\\ncounting them multiple times. However, a set of algorithms exist that trade \\\\\\\\nmemory for precision: they return an estimated measure with a standard error, \\\\\\\\nwhich, in the case of the Redis implementation for HyperLogLog, is less than 1%.\\\\\\\\nThe magic of this algorithm is that you no longer need to use an amount of memory\\\\\\\\nproportional to the number of items counted, and instead can use a\\\\\\\\nconstant amount of memory; 12k bytes in the worst case, or a lot less if your\\\\\\\\nHyperLogLog (We\\'ll just call them HLL from now) has seen very few elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHLLs in Redis, while technically a different data structure, are encoded\\\\\\\\nas a Redis string, so you can call [`GET`]() to serialize a HLL, and [`SET`]()\\\\\\\\nto deserialize it back to the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConceptually the HLL API is like using Sets to do the same task. You would\\\\\\\\n[`SADD`]() every observed element into a set, and would use [`SCARD`]() to check the\\\\\\\\nnumber of elements inside the set, which are unique since [`SADD`]() will not\\\\\\\\nre-add an existing element.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile you don\\'t really *add items* into an HLL, because the data structure\\\\\\\\nonly contains a state that does not include actual elements, the API is the\\\\\\\\nsame:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time you see a new element, you add it to the count with [`PFADD`]().\\\\\\\\n* When you want to retrieve the current approximation of unique elements added using the [`PFADD`]() command, you can use the [`PFCOUNT`]() command. If you need to merge two different HLLs, the [`PFMERGE`]() command is available. Since HLLs provide approximate counts of unique elements, the result of the merge will give you an approximation of the number of unique elements across both source HLLs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> PFADD bikes Hyperion Deimos Phoebe Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> PFADD commuter_bikes Salacia Mimas Quaoar\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> PFMERGE all_bikes bikes commuter_bikes\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> PFCOUNT all_bikes\\\\\\\\n(integer) 6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSome examples of use cases for this data structure is counting unique queries\\\\\\\\nperformed by users in a search form every day, number of unique visitors to a web page and other similar cases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is also able to perform the union of HLLs, please check the\\\\\\\\n[full documentation]() for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Anonymous unique visits of a web page (SaaS, analytics tools)** \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis application answers these questions: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- How many unique visits has this page had on this day? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have played this song? \\\\\\\\n- How many unique users have viewed this video? \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nStoring the IP address or any other kind of personal identifier is against the law in some countries, which makes it impossible to get unique visitor statistics on your website.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne HyperLogLog is created per page (video/song) per period, and every IP/identifier is added to it on every visit.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4658,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1633ae9e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1633ae9e-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/probabilistic/cuckoo-filter.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Cuckoo filter\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Bloom vs. Cuckoo filters\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Cuckoo filter, just like a Bloom filter, is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Open Source that enables you to check if an element is present in a set in a very fast and space efficient way, while also allowing for deletions and showing better performance than Bloom in some scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the Bloom filter is a bit array with flipped bits at positions decided by the hash function, a Cuckoo filter is an array of buckets, storing fingerprints of the values in one of the buckets at positions decided by the two hash functions.

Here's how it works:\n\n## Failover Process Overview\n\nRedis Sentinel performs automatic failover when a master is not working as expected. The process involves:\n\n1. **Failure Detection** - Multiple Sentinels must agree that the master is down before triggering failover\n2. **Leader Election** - One Sentinel is elected to perform the failover\n3. **Replica Promotion** - A suitable replica is selected and promoted to master\n4. **Reconfiguration** - Other replicas are reconfigured to use the new master\n5. **Client Notification** - Applications are informed of the new master address\n\n## Key Mechanisms\n\n**Quorum and Authorization:**\n- **Quorum**: The number of Sentinels that must detect an error condition to flag the master as ODOWN (Objectively Down)\n- **Authorization**: After triggering failover, the Sentinel must get authorization from a **majority** of Sentinels to actually perform it\n- Sentinel never performs failover in a partition where only a minority of Sentinels exist\n\nExample: With 5 Sentinels and quorum=2:\n- Failover triggers when 2 Sentinels detect the master is down\n- But one Sentinel can only proceed if it gets authorization from at least 3 Sentinels (majority)\n\n**Replica Selection Criteria:**\n\nWhen ready to failover, Sentinel selects a replica based on:\n1. **Disconnection time** - Replicas disconnected too long are skipped\n2. **Replica priority** - Lower priority values are preferred\n3. **Replication offset** - Replica with most data from master is preferred\n4. **Run ID** - Lexicographically smaller ID as tiebreaker\n\nReplicas disconnected for more than `(down-after-milliseconds * 10) + time_since_SDOWN` are considered unreliable and excluded.\n\n## Configuration\n\nBasic Sentinel configuration for monitoring a master:\n\n```\nsentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2\nsentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 60000\nsentinel failover-timeout mymaster 180000\nsentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1\n```\n\nThe quorum parameter (2 in this example) tunes sensitivity - lower values make Sentinel more sensitive to failures, higher values require broader consensus.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md > Sentinel as a distributed system, Quorum, Replica selection and priority]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sentinel", "failover", "master", "replication", "replica", "monitor", "OBJECT", "MULTI"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md", "docs/eval-review.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "14a19164-f127-455d-8a98-00b970000487", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "0d9dd5c8-3ae3-4d75-841b-fccb95044c3f", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Redis Sentinel's automatic failover handling.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_0tTGOClzcB7pY7axrld4sW', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis Sentinel automatic failover process', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_k1wbtwrv6uN3lNUz5Dd2lc', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'Sentinel.*failover|automatic failover|failover process'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_0tTGOClzcB7pY7axrld4sW', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.726,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis service discovery via Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Sentinel is a monitoring solution for Redis instances that handles\\\\\\\\nautomatic failover of Redis masters and service discovery (who is the current\\\\\\\\nmaster for a given group of instances?).

Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties. In this document concepts will be introduced gradually\\\\\\\\nstarting from basic information needed in order to understand the basic\\\\\\\\nproperties of Sentinel, to more complex information (that are optional) in\\\\\\\\norder to understand how exactly Sentinel works.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8874,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-025\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Algorithms and internals > Quorum\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The previous sections showed that every master monitored by Sentinel is associated to a configured **quorum**. It specifies the number of Sentinel processes\\\\\\\\nthat need to agree about the unreachability or error condition of the master in\\\\\\\\norder to trigger a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, after the failover is triggered, in order for the failover to actually be performed, **at least a majority of Sentinels must authorize the Sentinel to\\\\\\\\nfailover**. Sentinel never performs a failover in the partition where a\\\\\\\\nminority of Sentinels exist.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s try to make things a bit more clear:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Quorum: the number of Sentinel processes that need to detect an error condition in order for a master to be flagged as **ODOWN**.\\\\\\\\n* The failover is triggered by the **ODOWN** state.\\\\\\\\n* Once the failover is triggered, the Sentinel trying to failover is required to ask for authorization to a majority of Sentinels (or more than the majority if the quorum is set to a number greater than the majority).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe difference may seem subtle but is actually quite simple to understand and use.  For example if you have 5 Sentinel instances, and the quorum is set to 2, a failover will be triggered as soon as 2 Sentinels believe that the master is not reachable, however one of the two Sentinels will be able to failover only if it gets authorization at least from 3 Sentinels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf instead the quorum is configured to 5, all the Sentinels must agree about the master error condition, and the authorization from all Sentinels is required in order to failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that the quorum can be used to tune Sentinel in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. If a quorum is set to a value smaller than the majority of Sentinels we deploy, we are basically making Sentinel more sensitive to master failures, triggering a failover as soon as even just a minority of Sentinels is no longer able to talk with the master.\\\\\\\\n2. If a quorum is set to a value greater than the majority of Sentinels, we are making Sentinel able to failover only when there are a very large number (larger than majority) of well connected Sentinels which agree about the master being down.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.5916,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-023\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > Replica selection and priority\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When a Sentinel instance is ready to perform a failover, since the master\\\\\\\\nis in `ODOWN` state and the Sentinel received the authorization to failover\\\\\\\\nfrom the majority of the Sentinel instances known, a suitable replica needs\\\\\\\\nto be selected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe replica selection process evaluates the following information about replicas:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

If multiple replicas have the same priority and processed the same data from the master, a further check is performed, selecting the replica with the lexicographically smaller run ID.

slots（哈希槽）**，每个 master 节点负责其中一部分 hash slots。\n\n### Hash Slot 计算公式\n\n```\nHASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\n```\n\n- 使用 CRC16 算法（XMODEM 变体）对 key 进行哈希\n- 对 16384 取模得到 hash slot 编号（0-16383）\n- 实际使用 CRC16 输出的 14 位（16 位中的 14 位）\n\n### 分片示例\n\n假设有 3 个节点的集群：\n- Node A：负责 hash slots 0-5500\n- Node B：负责 hash slots 5501-11000  \n- Node C：负责 hash slots 11001-16383\n\n## Hash Tags（哈希标签）\n\n为了支持多键操作，Redis Cluster 实现了 **hash tags** 机制：\n\n**规则**：如果 key 中包含 `{...}` 模式，只对花括号内的内容进行哈希计算。\n\n**示例**：\n- `{user1000}.following` 和 `{user1000}.followers` → 只哈希 `user1000`，保证在同一 slot\n- `user:{123}:profile` 和 `user:{123}:account` → 只哈希 `123`，可以执行多键操作\n\n**特殊情况**：\n- `foo{}{bar}` → 哈希整个 key（花括号内为空）\n- `foo{{bar}}zap` → 哈希 `{bar`（第一个 `{` 到第一个 `}` 之间）\n- `foo{bar}{zap}` → 哈希 `bar`（算法在第一个有效匹配处停止）\n\n## Hash Slot 配置传播\n\n集群使用两种方式传播 hash slot 配置：\n\n1. **心跳消息**：每个 ping/pong 包都包含节点负责的 hash slots 信息\n2. **UPDATE 消息**：当节点发现发送者信息过时时，强制发送新配置\n\n### 配置更新规则\n\n**规则 1**：如果 hash slot 未分配（NULL），且某节点声明拥有它 → 绑定到该节点\n\n**规则 2**：如果 hash slot 已分配，但收到更高 `configEpoch` 的声明 → 重新绑定到新节点\n\n这个机制称为 **\"last failover wins\"**（最后故障转移获胜）。\n\n## 动态重新分片\n\n添加/删除节点本质上是 **移动 hash slots**：\n\n### 迁移过程\n\n假设将 slot 8 从节点 A 迁移到节点 B：\n\n1. `CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 IMPORTING A`（在 B 上执行）\n2. `CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 MIGRATING B`（在 A 上执行）\n\n**迁移期间的行为**：\n- A 上已存在的 key → 继续由 A 处理\n- A 上不存在的 key → 用 `-ASK` 重定向到 B\n- 使用 `MIGRATE` 命令原子性地迁移 key\n\n3. 迁移完成后：`CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 NODE <node-id>`\n\n### 优势\n\n- 无需停机即可添加/删除节点\n- 无需停机即可调整节点负载（重新平衡 hash slots）\n\n## 客户端重定向\n\n当客户端访问的 key 不在当前节点时：\n\n**MOVED 错误**：\n```\nGET x\n-MOVED 3999 127.0.0.1:6381\n```\n表示 hash slot 3999 由 127.0.0.1:6381 负责，客户端应更新本地映射表。\n\n**ASK 错误**：\n在 slot 迁移期间使用，临时重定向，不更新客户端映射表。\n\n---\n\n**来源**：\n- [Redis cluster specification > Key distribution

cluster node is serving a given set of hash slots. This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.5445,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > Live reconfiguration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster supports the ability to add and remove nodes while the cluster\\\\\\\\nis running. Adding or removing a node is abstracted into the same\\\\\\\\noperation: moving a hash slot from one node to another. This means\\\\\\\\nthat the same basic mechanism can be used in order to rebalance the cluster, add\\\\\\\\nor remove nodes, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To add a new node to the cluster an empty node is added to the cluster and some set of hash slots are moved from existing nodes to the new node.\\\\\\\\n* To remove a node from the cluster the hash slots assigned to that node are moved to other existing nodes.\\\\\\\\n* To rebalance the cluster a given set of hash slots are moved between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe core of the implementation is the ability to move hash slots around.\\\\\\\\nFrom a practical point of view a hash slot is just a set of keys, so\\\\\\\\nwhat Redis Cluster really does during *resharding* is to move keys from\\\\\\\\nan instance to another instance. Moving a hash slot means moving all the keys\\\\\\\\nthat happen to hash into this hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo understand how this works we need to show the [`CLUSTER`](/commands/cluster) subcommands\\\\\\\\nthat are used to manipulate the slots translation table in a Redis Cluster node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following subcommands are available (among others not useful in this case):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-delslots) slot1 [slot2] ... [slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-addslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER DELSLOTSRANGE`](/commands/cluster-delslotsrange) start-slot1 end-slot1 [start-slot2 end-slot2] ... [start-slotN end-slotN]\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot NODE node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot MIGRATING node\\\\\\\\n* [`CLUSTER SETSLOT`](/commands/cluster-setslot) slot IMPORTING node\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first four commands, `ADDSLOTS`, `DELSLOTS`, `ADDSLOTSRANGE` and `DELSLOTSRANGE`, are simply used to assign\\\\\\\\n(or remove) slots to a Redis node. Assigning a slot means to tell a given\\\\\\\\nmaster node that it will be in charge of storing and serving content for\\\\\\\\nthe specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the hash slots are assigned they will propagate across the cluster\\\\\\\\nusing the gossip protocol, as specified later in the\\\\\\\\n*configuration propagation* section.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `ADDSLOTS` and `ADDSLOTSRANGE` commands are usually used when a new cluster is created\\\\\\\\nfrom scratch to assign each master node a subset of all the 16384 hash\\\\\\\\nslots available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `DELSLOTS`  and `DELSLOTSRANGE` are mainly used for manual modification of a cluster configuration\\\\\\\\nor for debugging tasks: in practice it is rarely used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `SETSLOT` subcommand is used to assign a slot to a specific node ID if\\\\\\\\nthe `SETSLOT <slot> NODE` form is used. Otherwise the slot can be set in the\\\\\\\\ntwo special states `MIGRATING` and `IMPORTING`. Those two special states\\\\\\\\nare used in order to migrate a hash slot from one node to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as MIGRATING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the key in question\\\\\\\\nexists, otherwise the query is forwarded using a `-ASK` redirection to the\\\\\\\\nnode that is target of the migration.\\\\\\\\n* When a slot is set as IMPORTING, the node will accept all queries that\\\\\\\\nare about this hash slot, but only if the request is\\\\\\\\npreceded by an [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command. If the [`ASKING`](/commands/asking) command was not given\\\\\\\\nby the client, the query is redirected to the real hash slot owner via\\\\\\\\na `-MOVED` redirection error, as would happen normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s make this clearer with an example of hash slot migration.\\\\\\\\nAssume that we have two Redis master nodes, called A and B.\\\\\\\\nWe want to move hash slot 8 from A to B, so we issue commands like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We send B: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 IMPORTING A\\\\\\\\n* We send A: CLUSTER SETSLOT 8 MIGRATING B\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll the other nodes will continue to point clients to node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" every time\\\\\\\\nthey are queried with a key that belongs to hash slot 8, so what happens\\\\\\\\nis that:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* All queries about existing keys are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* All queries about non-existing keys in A are processed by \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\", because \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will redirect clients to \\\\\\\\\\\\\"B\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis way we no longer create new keys in \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\nIn the meantime, `redis-cli` used during reshardings\\\\\\\\nand Redis Cluster configuration will migrate existing keys in\\\\\\\\nhash slot 8 from A to B.\\\\\\\\nThis is performed using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CLUSTER GETKEYSINSLOT slot count\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will return `count` keys in the specified hash slot.\\\\\\\\nFor keys returned, `redis-cli` sends node \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) command, that\\\\\\\\nwill migrate the specified keys from A to B in an atomic way (both instances\\\\\\\\nare locked for the time (usually very small time) needed to migrate keys so\\\\\\\\nthere are no race conditions). This is how [`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    MIGRATE target_host target_port \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\" target_database id timeout KEYS key1 key2 ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) will connect to the target instance, send a serialized version of\\\\\\\\nthe key, and once an OK code is received, the old key from its own dataset\\\\\\\\nwill be deleted. From the point of view of an external client a key exists\\\\\\\\neither in A or B at any given time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis Cluster there is no need to specify a database other than 0, but\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is a general command that can be used for other tasks not\\\\\\\\ninvolving Redis Cluster.\\\\\\\\n[`MIGRATE`](/commands/migrate) is optimized to be as fast as possible even when moving complex\\\\\\\\nkeys such as long lists, but in Redis Cluster reconfiguring the\\\\\\\\ncluster where big keys are present is not considered a wise procedure if\\\\\\\\nthere are latency constraints in the application using the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the migration process is finally finished, the `SETSLOT <slot> NODE <node-id>` command is sent to the two nodes involved in the migration in order to\\\\\\\\nset the slots to their normal state again. The same command is usually\\\\\\\\nsent to all other nodes to avoid waiting for the natural\\\\\\\\npropagation of the new configuration across the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.8117,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Overview of Redis Cluster main components > Hash tags\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"There is an exception for the computation of the hash slot that is used in order\\\\\\\\nto implement **hash tags**.

Because of this they\\'ll send an `UPDATE` message to A with the new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration for the slots.

Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.1267,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Main properties and rationales of the design > Implemented subset\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Cluster is a distributed implementation of Redis with the following goals in order of importance in the design:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* High performance and linear scalability up to 1000 nodes.

The same happens if the contacted node had no updated information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo while from the point of view of the cluster nodes are identified by\\\\\\\\nIDs we try to simplify our interface with the client just exposing a map\\\\\\\\nbetween hash slots and Redis nodes identified by endpoint:port pairs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client is not required to, but should try to memorize that hash slot\\\\\\\\n3999 is served by 127.0.0.1:6381.

Hashing involves combining the\\\\\\\\nraw byte values from the key to produce an integer *index* number. The index is then\\\\\\\\nused to locate the *hash slot* where the value for the key is stored.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally, the whole key is used to calculate the hash index, but there are some\\\\\\\\nsituations where you need to hash only a part of the key. You can select the\\\\\\\\nsection of the key you want to hash using a pair of curly braces `{...}` to create\\\\\\\\na *hashtag*.

This combines AOF's durability with RDB's efficient backups and faster restarts.\n\n[Source: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md > RDB disadvantages, AOF disadvantages]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["failover", "RDB", "AOF", "snapshot", "replica", "slow", "memory", "MEMORY"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "425649f4-5dae-4439-bdf7-d75c41320eef", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "4c214fba-79b6-44b7-abd5-2e6b1f45c4af", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search for information about RDB and AOF persistence in Redis using both keyword search and semantic search.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_Djl2KAqt23b59aWKzd2ixt', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'RDB|AOF'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_sDDuLrPNrG5C7KwrFllBFz', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'RDB AOF persistence Redis difference', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_Djl2KAqt23b59aWKzd2ixt', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_sDDuLrPNrG5C7KwrFllBFz', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 6.2025,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RDB disadvantages\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Persistence refers to the writing of data to durable storage, such as a solid-state disk (SSD). Redis provides a range of persistence options. These include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **RDB** (Redis Database): RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.\\\\\\\\n* **AOF** (Append Only File): AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server. These operations can then be replayed again at server startup, reconstructing the original dataset. Commands are logged using the same format as the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n* **No persistence**: You can disable persistence completely. This is sometimes used when caching.\\\\\\\\n* **RDB + AOF**: You can also combine both AOF and RDB in the same instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\'d rather not think about the tradeoffs between these different persistence strategies, you may want to consider [Redis Software\\'s persistence options](), which can be pre-configured using a UI.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo learn more about how to evaluate your Redis persistence strategy, read on.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is a very compact single-file point-in-time representation of your Redis data. RDB files are perfect for backups. For instance you may want to archive your RDB files every hour for the latest 24 hours, and to save an RDB snapshot every day for 30 days. This allows you to easily restore different versions of the data set in case of disasters.\\\\\\\\n* RDB is very good for disaster recovery, being a single compact file that can be transferred to far data centers, or onto Amazon S3 (possibly encrypted).\\\\\\\\n* RDB maximizes Redis performances since the only work the Redis parent process needs to do in order to persist is forking a child that will do all the rest. The parent process will never perform disk I/O or alike.\\\\\\\\n* RDB allows faster restarts with big datasets compared to AOF.\\\\\\\\n* On replicas, RDB supports [partial resynchronizations after restarts and failovers]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* RDB is NOT good if you need to minimize the chance of data loss in case Redis stops working (for example after a power outage). You can configure different *save points* where an RDB is produced (for instance after at least five minutes and 100 writes against the data set, you can have multiple save points). However you\\'ll usually create an RDB snapshot every five minutes or more, so in case of Redis stopping working without a correct shutdown for any reason you should be prepared to lose the latest minutes of data.\\\\\\\\n* RDB needs to fork() often in order to persist on disk using a child process. fork() can be time consuming if the dataset is big, and may result in Redis stopping serving clients for some milliseconds or even for one second if the dataset is very big and the CPU performance is not great. AOF also needs to fork() but less frequently and you can tune how often you want to rewrite your logs without any trade-off on durability.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.2302,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"AOF disadvantages\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Using AOF Redis is much more durable: you can have different fsync policies: no fsync at all, fsync every second, fsync at every query. With the default policy of fsync every second, write performance is still great. fsync is performed using a background thread and the main thread will try hard to perform writes when no fsync is in progress, so you can only lose one second worth of writes.\\\\\\\\n* The AOF log is an append-only log, so there are no seeks, nor corruption problems if there is a power outage. Even if the log ends with a half-written command for some reason (disk full or other reasons) the redis-check-aof tool is able to fix it easily.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is able to automatically rewrite the AOF in background when it gets too big. The rewrite is completely safe as while Redis continues appending to the old file, a completely new one is produced with the minimal set of operations needed to create the current data set, and once this second file is ready Redis switches the two and starts appending to the new one.\\\\\\\\n* AOF contains a log of all the operations one after the other in an easy to understand and parse format. You can even easily export an AOF file. For instance even if you\\'ve accidentally flushed everything using the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command, as long as no rewrite of the log was performed in the meantime, you can still save your data set just by stopping the server, removing the latest command, and restarting Redis again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF files are usually bigger than the equivalent RDB files for the same dataset.\\\\\\\\n* AOF can be slower than RDB depending on the exact fsync policy. In general with fsync set to *every second* performance is still very high, and with fsync disabled it should be exactly as fast as RDB even under high load. Still RDB is able to provide more guarantees about the maximum latency even in the case of a huge write load.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis < 7.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AOF can use a lot of memory if there are writes to the database during a rewrite (these are buffered in memory and written to the new AOF at the end).\\\\\\\\n* All write commands that arrive during rewrite are written to disk twice.\\\\\\\\n* Redis could freeze writing and fsyncing these write commands to the new AOF file at the end of the rewrite.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nOk, so what should I use?\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe general indication you should use both persistence methods is if\\\\\\\\nyou want a degree of data safety comparable to what PostgreSQL can provide you.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you care a lot about your data, but still can live with a few minutes of\\\\\\\\ndata loss in case of disasters, you can simply use RDB alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are many users using AOF alone, but we discourage it since to have an\\\\\\\\nRDB snapshot from time to time is a great idea for doing database backups,\\\\\\\\nfor faster restarts, and in the event of bugs in the AOF engine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following sections will illustrate a few more details about the two persistence models.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.8847,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-008\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Append-only file > How I can switch to AOF, if I\\'m currently using dump.rdb snapshots?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If you want to enable AOF in a server that is currently using RDB snapshots, you need to convert the data by enabling AOF via CONFIG command on the live server first.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT:** not following this procedure (e.g. just changing the config and restarting the server) can result in data loss!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis >= 2.2**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPreparations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Make a backup of your latest dump.rdb file.\\\\\\\\n* Transfer this backup to a safe place.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSwitch to AOF on live database:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Enable AOF: `redis-cli config set appendonly yes`\\\\\\\\n* Optionally disable RDB: `redis-cli config set save \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`\\\\\\\\n* Make sure writes are appended to the append only file correctly.\\\\\\\\n* **IMPORTANT:** Update your `redis.conf` (potentially through [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite)) and ensure that it matches the configuration above.\\\\\\\\n  If you forget this step, when you restart the server, the configuration changes will be lost and the server will start again with the old configuration, resulting in a loss of your data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext time you restart the server:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Before restarting the server, wait for AOF rewrite to finish persisting the data.\\\\\\\\n  You can do that by watching `INFO persistence`, waiting for `aof_rewrite_in_progress` and `aof_rewrite_scheduled` to be `0`, and validating that `aof_last_bgrewrite_status` is `ok`.\\\\\\\\n* After restarting the server, check that your database contains the same number of keys it contained previously.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Redis 2.0**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Make a backup of your latest dump.rdb file.\\\\\\\\n* Transfer this backup into a safe place.\\\\\\\\n* Stop all the writes against the database!\\\\\\\\n* Issue a `redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF`.

Redis data types are closely related to fundamental data structures and are exposed to the programmer as such, without additional abstraction layers.\\\\\\\\n* Redis is an in-memory but persistent on disk database, so it represents a different trade off where very high write and read speed is achieved with the limitation of data sets that can\\'t be larger than memory. Another advantage of\\\\\\\\nin-memory databases is that the memory representation of complex data structures\\\\\\\\nis much simpler to manipulate compared to the same data structures on disk, so\\\\\\\\nRedis can do a lot with little internal complexity. At the same time the\\\\\\\\ntwo on-disk storage formats (RDB and AOF) don\\'t need to be suitable for random\\\\\\\\naccess, so they are compact and always generated in an append-only fashion\\\\\\\\n(Even the AOF log rotation is an append-only operation, since the new version\\\\\\\\nis generated from the copy of data in memory). However this design also involves\\\\\\\\ndifferent challenges compared to traditional on-disk stores. Being the main data\\\\\\\\nrepresentation on memory, Redis operations must be carefully handled to make sure\\\\\\\\nthere is always an updated version of the data set on disk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An empty instance uses ~ 3MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 85MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n* 1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 160 MB of memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTesting your use case is trivial. Use the `redis-benchmark` utility to generate random data sets then check the space used with the `INFO memory` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n64-bit systems will use considerably more memory than 32-bit systems to store the same keys, especially if the keys and values are small. This is because pointers take 8 bytes in 64-bit systems. But of course the advantage is that you can\\\\\\\\nhave a lot of memory in 64-bit systems, so in order to run large Redis servers a 64-bit system is more or less required. The alternative is sharding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the past the Redis developers experimented with Virtual Memory and other systems in order to allow larger than RAM datasets, but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well: data served from memory, disk used for storage. So for now there are no plans to create an on disk backend for Redis. Most of what\\\\\\\\nRedis is, after all, a direct result of its current design.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf your real problem is not the total RAM needed, but the fact that you need\\\\\\\\nto split your data set into multiple Redis instances, please read the\\\\\\\\n[partitioning page]() in this documentation for more info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Ltd., the company sponsoring Redis development, has developed a\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis on Flash\\\\\\\\\\\\\" solution that uses a mixed RAM/flash approach for\\\\\\\\nlarger data sets with a biased access pattern.

After connecting, clients must authenticate with a username and password, and the connection is then associated with that user's permissions.\n\n## Configuration Methods\n\nThere are two ways to configure ACL users:\n\n1. **Directly in `redis.conf`** - Good for simple use cases\n2. **External ACL file** - Recommended for complex environments with multiple users\n\nThese methods are mutually exclusive.\n\n## ACL Rule Format\n\n```\nuser <username> ... acl rules ...\n```\n\nExample:\n```\nuser worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99\n```\n\n## Using External ACL File\n\nSpecify the ACL file in `redis.conf`:\n```\naclfile /etc/redis/users.acl\n```\n\nBenefits of external ACL file:\n- Use `ACL LOAD` to reload configuration after manual edits\n- Use `ACL SAVE` to save current ACL configuration to file\n- Better separation of concerns (CONFIG REWRITE doesn't trigger ACL SAVE)\n\n## Managing ACLs with Commands\n\nCheck current ACLs:\n```\n> ACL LIST\n1) \"user default on nopass ~* &* +@all\"\n```\n\nThe default user is configured to:\n- Be active (`on`)\n- Require no password (`nopass`)\n- Access every key (`~*`)\n- Access every Pub/Sub channel (`&*`)\n- Call every command (`+@all`)\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n1. **Security**: Restrict untrusted clients while giving trusted clients minimum necessary access (e.g., read-only commands)\n2. **Operational Safety**: Prevent accidental data damage (e.g., workers shouldn't be able to call `FLUSHALL`)\n3. **Managed Redis**: Exclude configuration commands for customers in SaaS or internal managed setups\n\n## Authentication\n\nRedis 6+ supports two-argument AUTH:\n```\nAUTH <username> <password>\n```\n\nLegacy single-argument form (authenticates as \"default\" user):\n```\nAUTH <password>\n```\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md > When ACLs are useful, Configure ACLs with the ACL command, ACL rules for Sentinel

ACL, short for Access Control List, is the feature that allows certain\\\\\\\\nconnections to be limited in terms of the commands that can be executed and the\\\\\\\\nkeys that can be accessed. The way it works is that, after connecting, a client\\\\\\\\nis required to provide a username and a valid password to authenticate. If authentication succeeded, the connection is associated with a given\\\\\\\\nuser and the limits the user has. Redis can be configured so that new\\\\\\\\nconnections are already authenticated with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\" user (this is the\\\\\\\\ndefault configuration). Configuring the default user has, as a side effect,\\\\\\\\nthe ability to provide only a specific subset of functionalities to connections\\\\\\\\nthat are not explicitly authenticated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the default configuration, Redis 6 (the first version to have ACLs) works\\\\\\\\nexactly like older versions of Redis. Every new connection is\\\\\\\\ncapable of calling every possible command and accessing every key, so the\\\\\\\\nACL feature is backward compatible with old clients and applications. Also\\\\\\\\nthe old way to configure a password, using the **requirepass** configuration\\\\\\\\ndirective, still works as expected. However, it now\\\\\\\\nsets a password for the default user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command was extended in Redis 6, so now it is possible to\\\\\\\\nuse it in the two-arguments form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <username> <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of the old form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    AUTH <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat happens is that the username used to authenticate is \\\\\\\\\\\\\"default\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so\\\\\\\\njust specifying the password implies that we want to authenticate against\\\\\\\\nthe default user. This provides backward compatibility.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore using ACLs, you may want to ask yourself what\\'s the goal you want to\\\\\\\\naccomplish by implementing this layer of protection. Normally there are\\\\\\\\ntwo main goals that are well served by ACLs:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. You want to improve security by restricting the access to commands and keys, so that untrusted clients have no access and trusted clients have just the minimum access level to the database in order to perform the work needed. For instance, certain clients may just be able to execute read only commands.\\\\\\\\n2. You want to improve operational safety, so that processes or humans accessing Redis are not allowed to damage the data or the configuration due to software errors or manual mistakes. For instance, there is no reason for a worker that fetches delayed jobs from Redis to be able to call the [`FLUSHALL`](/commands/flushall) command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother typical usage of ACLs is related to managed Redis instances. Redis is\\\\\\\\noften provided as a managed service both by internal company teams that handle\\\\\\\\nthe Redis infrastructure for the other internal customers they have, or is\\\\\\\\nprovided in a software-as-a-service setup by cloud providers. In both \\\\\\\\nsetups, we want to be sure that configuration commands are excluded for the\\\\\\\\ncustomers.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3094,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"053594d0-009\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/acl.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ACL\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"ACL rules for Sentinel and Replicas\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"There are two ways to store users inside the Redis configuration:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Users can be specified directly inside the `redis.conf` file.\\\\\\\\n2. It is possible to specify an external ACL file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two methods are *mutually incompatible*, so Redis will ask you to use one\\\\\\\\nor the other. Specifying users inside `redis.conf` is\\\\\\\\ngood for simple use cases. When there are multiple users to define, in a\\\\\\\\ncomplex environment, we recommend you use the ACL file instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe format used inside `redis.conf` and in the external ACL file is exactly\\\\\\\\nthe same, so it is trivial to switch from one to the other, and is\\\\\\\\nthe following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    user <username> ... acl rules ...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    user worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you want to use an external ACL file, you are required to specify\\\\\\\\nthe configuration directive called `aclfile`, like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    aclfile /etc/redis/users.acl\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are just specifying a few users directly inside the `redis.conf`\\\\\\\\nfile, you can use [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite) in order to store the new user configuration\\\\\\\\ninside the file by rewriting it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe external ACL file however is more powerful. You can do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Use [`ACL LOAD`](/commands/acl-load) if you modified the ACL file manually and you want Redis to reload the new configuration. Note that this command is able to load the file *only if all the users are correctly specified*. Otherwise, an error is reported to the user, and the old configuration will remain valid.\\\\\\\\n* Use [`ACL SAVE`](/commands/acl-save) to save the current ACL configuration to the ACL file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that [`CONFIG REWRITE`](/commands/config-rewrite) does not also trigger [`ACL SAVE`](/commands/acl-save). When you use\\\\\\\\nan ACL file, the configuration and the ACLs are handled separately.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn case you don\\'t want to provide Redis replicas and Redis Sentinel instances\\\\\\\\nfull access to your Redis instances, the following is the set of commands\\\\\\\\nthat must be allowed in order for everything to work correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinel, allow the user to access the following commands both in the master and replica instances:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* AUTH, CLIENT, SUBSCRIBE, SCRIPT, PUBLISH, PING, INFO, MULTI, SLAVEOF, CONFIG, CLIENT, EXEC.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel does not need to access any key in the database but does use Pub/Sub, so the ACL rule would be the following (note: [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) is not needed since it is always allowed):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ACL SETUSER sentinel-user on >somepassword allchannels +multi +slaveof +ping +exec +subscribe +config|rewrite +role +publish +info +client|setname +client|kill +script|kill\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis replicas require the following commands to be allowed on the master instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PSYNC, REPLCONF, PING\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNo keys need to be accessed, so this translates to the following rules:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    ACL setuser replica-user on >somepassword +psync +replconf +ping\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that you don\\'t need to configure the replicas to allow the master to be able to execute any set of commands.

RDB 生成完成后传输给从节点\n4. 从节点保存到磁盘并加载到内存\n5. 主节点发送所有缓冲的命令到从节点\n\n---\n\n## PSYNC 工作原理\n\nPSYNC 是 Redis 用于实现 **增量同步** 的核心命令（替代了旧的 SYNC 命令）。\n\n### 核心概念：Replication ID + Offset\n\n每个 Redis 主节点维护两个关键标识：\n\n- **Replication ID**：一个大型伪随机字符串，标记数据集的特定历史\n- **Replication Offset**：递增的字节偏移量，记录已发送的复制流位置\n\n这两个值的组合 `(Replication ID, Offset)` 唯一标识主节点数据集的精确版本。\n\n### PSYNC 执行流程\n\n1. **从节点发起连接**\n   - 从节点向主节点发送 `PSYNC` 命令\n   - 携带参数：旧主节点的 Replication ID + 已处理的 Offset\n\n2. **主节点判断同步方式**\n   \n   **情况 A：部分重同步（增量）**\n   - 如果主节点的 backlog 缓冲区包含从节点缺失的数据\n   - 且 Replication ID 匹配\n   - 则只发送增量部分（从 offset 开始的命令流）\n\n   **情况 B：完全重同步**\n   - 如果 backlog 不足（数据已被覆盖）\n   - 或者 Replication ID 不匹配（从节点引用的历史已不存在）\n   - 则执行完整的 RDB 传输 + 命令流同步\n\n### 双 Replication ID 机制\n\nRedis 实例维护两个 Replication ID（主 ID 和次 ID）以支持故障转移：\n\n- 当从节点被提升为主节点时：\n  - 将旧的主 ID 保存为次 ID\n  - 生成新的随机主 ID\n- 其他从节点连接新主节点时：\n  - 可以使用次 ID 进行部分重同步\n  - 避免故障转移后的完全重同步\n\n---\n\n## 关键特性\n\n- **异步复制**：主节点不等待从节点确认，低延迟高性能\n- **自动重连**：从节点断线后自动重连并尝试增量同步\n- **多从节点**：一个主节点可以有多个从节点\n- **级联复制**：从节点可以连接其他从节点形成树状结构\n- **非阻塞**：主节点在同步期间仍可处理查询\n\n---\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md > How Redis replication works]**", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/progress-2025-02-13.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RDB", "replication", "replica", "PSYNC"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/progress-2025-02-13.md", "docs/runbook/redis-failover.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "8b07c3af-ef8c-44b0-aa64-e9c3ff7648d2", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "298f0e4e-463f-46a7-889f-099ab6a736b3", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='我来检索 Redis 主从复制和 PSYNC 的相关信息。')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_Zrr4cz1x7EURP4pHdwcYK8', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis 主从复制 replication PSYNC 工作原理', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_vwN4FGYblO5ZkFhv2lI3e2', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'PSYNC|主从复制|replication'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_Zrr4cz1x7EURP4pHdwcYK8', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.6812,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"How Redis replication works\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Every Redis master has a replication ID: it is a large pseudo random string\\\\\\\\nthat marks a given history of the dataset.

The replication offset is incremented even if no replica\\\\\\\\nis actually connected, so basically every given pair of:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Replication ID, offset\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIdentifies an exact version of the dataset of a master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen replicas connect to masters, they use the [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) command to send\\\\\\\\ntheir old master replication ID and the offsets they processed so far. This way\\\\\\\\nthe master can send just the incremental part needed. However if there is not\\\\\\\\nenough *backlog* in the master buffers, or if the replica is referring to an\\\\\\\\nhistory (replication ID) which is no longer known, then a full resynchronization\\\\\\\\nhappens: in this case the replica will get a full copy of the dataset, from scratch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how a full synchronization works in more details:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe master starts a background saving process to produce an RDB file. At the same time it starts to buffer all new write commands received from the clients. When the background saving is complete, the master transfers the database file to the replica, which saves it on disk, and then loads it into memory. The master will then send all buffered commands to the replica. This is done as a stream of commands and is in the same format of the Redis protocol itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can try it yourself via telnet. Connect to the Redis port while the\\\\\\\\nserver is doing some work and issue the [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) command. You\\'ll see a bulk\\\\\\\\ntransfer and then every command received by the master will be re-issued\\\\\\\\nin the telnet session. Actually [`SYNC`](/commands/sync) is an old protocol no longer used by\\\\\\\\nnewer Redis instances, but is still there for backward compatibility: it does\\\\\\\\nnot allow partial resynchronizations, so now [`PSYNC`](/commands/psync) is used instead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs already said, replicas are able to automatically reconnect when the master-replica link goes down for some reason. If the master receives multiple concurrent replica synchronization requests, it performs a single background save in to serve all of them.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.6188,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"At the base of Redis replication (excluding the high availability features provided as an additional layer by Redis Cluster or Redis Sentinel) there is a *leader follower* (master-replica) replication that is simple to use and configure. It allows replica Redis instances to be exact copies of master instances. The replica will automatically reconnect to the master every time the link breaks, and will attempt to be an exact copy of it *regardless* of what happens to the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis system works using three main mechanisms:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. When a master and a replica instance are well-connected, the master keeps the replica updated by sending a stream of commands to the replica to replicate the effects on the dataset happening on the master side due to: client writes, keys expired or evicted, any other action changing the master dataset.\\\\\\\\n2. When the link between the master and the replica breaks, for network issues or because a timeout is sensed in the master or the replica, the replica reconnects and attempts to proceed with a partial resynchronization: it means that it will try to just obtain the part of the stream of commands it missed during the disconnection.\\\\\\\\n3. When a partial resynchronization is not possible, the replica will ask for a full resynchronization. This will involve a more complex process in which the master needs to create a snapshot of all its data, send it to the replica, and then continue sending the stream of commands as the dataset changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses by default asynchronous replication, which being low latency and\\\\\\\\nhigh performance, is the natural replication mode for the vast majority of Redis\\\\\\\\nuse cases. However, Redis replicas asynchronously acknowledge the amount of data\\\\\\\\nthey receive periodically with the master. So the master does not wait every time\\\\\\\\nfor a command to be processed by the replicas, however it knows, if needed, what\\\\\\\\nreplica already processed what command. This allows having optional synchronous replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSynchronous replication of certain data can be requested by the clients using\\\\\\\\nthe [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) command. However [`WAIT`](/commands/wait) is only able to ensure there are the\\\\\\\\nspecified number of acknowledged copies in the other Redis instances, it does not\\\\\\\\nturn a set of Redis instances into a CP system with strong consistency: acknowledged\\\\\\\\nwrites can still be lost during a failover, depending on the exact configuration\\\\\\\\nof the Redis persistence. However, [WAIT]() dramatically reduces the probability of losing a write after a failure event to specific hard-to-trigger failure modes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can check the Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster documentation for more information\\\\\\\\nabout high availability and failover.

Aside from connecting a number of replicas to the same master, replicas can also be connected to other replicas in a cascading-like structure. Since Redis 4.0, all the sub-replicas will receive exactly the same replication stream from the master.\\\\\\\\n* Redis replication is non-blocking on the master side. This means that the master will continue to handle queries when one or more replicas perform the initial synchronization or a partial resynchronization.\\\\\\\\n* Replication is also largely non-blocking on the replica side. While the replica is performing the initial synchronization, it can handle queries using the old version of the dataset, assuming you configured Redis to do so in redis.conf.  Otherwise, you can configure Redis replicas to return an error to clients if the replication stream is down. However, after the initial sync, the old dataset must be deleted and the new one must be loaded. The replica will block incoming connections during this brief window (that can be as long as many seconds for very large datasets). Since Redis 4.0 you can configure Redis so that the deletion of the old data set happens in a different thread, however loading the new initial dataset will still happen in the main thread and block the replica.\\\\\\\\n* Replication can be used both for scalability, to have multiple replicas for read-only queries (for example, slow O(N) operations can be offloaded to replicas), or simply for improving data safety and high availability.\\\\\\\\n* You can use replication to avoid the cost of having the master writing the full dataset to disk: a typical technique involves configuring your master `redis.conf` to avoid persisting to disk at all, then connect a replica configured to save from time to time, or with AOF enabled. However, this setup must be handled with care, since a restarting master will start with an empty dataset: if the replica tries to sync with it, the replica will be emptied as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.2414,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Allow writes only with N attached replicas\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"If your master has a password via `requirepass`, it\\'s trivial to configure the\\\\\\\\nreplica to use that password in all sync operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo do it on a running instance, use `redis-cli` and type:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    config set masterauth <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo set it permanently, add this to your config file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    masterauth <password>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStarting with Redis 2.8, you can configure a Redis master to\\\\\\\\naccept write queries only if at least N replicas are currently connected to the\\\\\\\\nmaster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, because Redis uses asynchronous replication it is not possible to ensure\\\\\\\\nthe replica actually received a given write, so there is always a window for data\\\\\\\\nloss.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how the feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis replicas ping the master every second, acknowledging the amount of replication stream processed.\\\\\\\\n* Redis masters will remember the last time it received a ping from every replica.\\\\\\\\n* The user can configure a minimum number of replicas that have a lag not greater than a maximum number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf there are at least N replicas, with a lag less than M seconds, then the write will be accepted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may think of it as a best effort data safety mechanism, where consistency is not ensured for a given write, but at least the time window for data loss is restricted to a given number of seconds.

Such a feature depends\\\\\\\\non the ability of an instance to count the time, however Redis replicas correctly\\\\\\\\nreplicate keys with expires, even when such keys are altered using Lua\\\\\\\\nscripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo implement such a feature Redis cannot rely on the ability of the master and\\\\\\\\nreplica to have synced clocks, since this is a problem that cannot be solved\\\\\\\\nand would result in race conditions and diverging data sets, so Redis\\\\\\\\nuses three main techniques to make the replication of expired keys\\\\\\\\nable to work:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Replicas don\\'t expire keys, instead they wait for masters to expire the keys. When a master expires a key (or evict it because of LRU), it synthesizes a [`DEL`](/commands/del) command which is transmitted to all the replicas.\\\\\\\\n2. However because of master-driven expire, sometimes replicas may still have in memory keys that are already logically expired, since the master was not able to provide the [`DEL`](/commands/del) command in time. To deal with that the replica uses its logical clock to report that a key does not exist **only for read operations** that don\\'t violate the consistency of the data set (as new commands from the master will arrive). In this way replicas avoid reporting logically expired keys that are still existing. In practical terms, an HTML fragments cache that uses replicas to scale will avoid returning items that are already older than the desired time to live.\\\\\\\\n3. During Lua scripts executions no key expiries are performed. As a Lua script runs, conceptually the time in the master is frozen, so that a given key will either exist or not for all the time the script runs. This prevents keys expiring in the middle of a script, and is needed to send the same script to the replica in a way that is guaranteed to have the same effects in the data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce a replica is promoted to a master it will start to expire keys independently, and will not require any help from its old master.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.3938,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-004\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Diskless replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In the previous section we said that if two instances have the same replication\\\\\\\\nID and replication offset, they have exactly the same data. However it is useful\\\\\\\\nto understand what exactly is the replication ID, and why instances have actually\\\\\\\\ntwo replication IDs: the main ID and the secondary ID.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA replication ID basically marks a given *history* of the data set. Every time\\\\\\\\nan instance restarts from scratch as a master, or a replica is promoted to master,\\\\\\\\na new replication ID is generated for this instance. The replicas connected to\\\\\\\\na master will inherit its replication ID after the handshake. So two instances\\\\\\\\nwith the same ID are related by the fact that they hold the same data, but\\\\\\\\npotentially at a different time. It is the offset that works as a logical time\\\\\\\\nto understand, for a given history (replication ID), who holds the most updated\\\\\\\\ndata set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, if two instances A and B have the same replication ID, but one\\\\\\\\nwith offset 1000 and one with offset 1023, it means that the first lacks certain\\\\\\\\ncommands applied to the data set. It also means that A, by applying just a few\\\\\\\\ncommands, may reach exactly the same state of B.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe reason why Redis instances have two replication IDs is because of replicas\\\\\\\\nthat are promoted to masters. After a failover, the promoted replica requires\\\\\\\\nto still remember what was its past replication ID, because such replication ID\\\\\\\\nwas the one of the former master. In this way, when other replicas will sync\\\\\\\\nwith the new master, they will try to perform a partial resynchronization using the\\\\\\\\nold master replication ID. This will work as expected, because when the replica\\\\\\\\nis promoted to master it sets its secondary ID to its main ID, remembering what\\\\\\\\nwas the offset when this ID switch happened. Later it will select a new random\\\\\\\\nreplication ID, because a new history begins. When handling the new replicas\\\\\\\\nconnecting, the master will match their IDs and offsets both with the current\\\\\\\\nID and the secondary ID (up to a given offset, for safety). In short this means\\\\\\\\nthat after a failover, replicas connecting to the newly promoted master don\\'t have\\\\\\\\nto perform a full sync.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn case you wonder why a replica promoted to master needs to change its\\\\\\\\nreplication ID after a failover: it is possible that the old master is still\\\\\\\\nworking as a master because of some network partition: retaining the same\\\\\\\\nreplication ID would violate the fact that the same ID and same offset of any\\\\\\\\ntwo random instances mean they have the same data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally a full resynchronization requires creating an RDB file on disk,\\\\\\\\nthen reloading the same RDB from disk to feed the replicas with the data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith slow disks this can be a very stressing operation for the master.\\\\\\\\nRedis version 2.8.18 is the first version to have support for diskless\\\\\\\\nreplication.

This does not mean that the feature is intended to expose a replica instance to the internet or more generally to a network where untrusted clients exist, because administrative commands like [`DEBUG`](/commands/debug) or [`CONFIG`](/commands/config) are still enabled. The [Security]() page describes how to secure a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may wonder why it is possible to revert the read-only setting\\\\\\\\nand have replica instances that can be targeted by write operations.\\\\\\\\nThe answer is that writable replicas exist only for historical reasons.\\\\\\\\nUsing writable replicas can result in inconsistency between the master and the replica, so it is not recommended to use writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nTo understand in which situations this can be a problem, we need to understand how replication works.\\\\\\\\nChanges on the master is replicated by propagating regular Redis commands to the replica.\\\\\\\\nWhen a key expires on the master, this is propagated as a DEL command.\\\\\\\\nIf a key which exists on the master but is deleted, expired or has a different type on the replica compared to the master will react differently to commands like DEL, INCR or RPOP propagated from the master than intended.\\\\\\\\nThe propagated command may fail on the replica or result in a different outcome.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risks (if you insist on using writable replicas) we suggest you follow these recommendations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t write to keys in a writable replica that are also used on the master.\\\\\\\\n  (This can be hard to guarantee if you don\\'t have control over all the clients that write to the master.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica as an intermediary step when upgrading a set of instances in a running system.\\\\\\\\n  In general, don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica if it can ever be promoted to a master if you want to guarantee data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHistorically, there were some use cases that were considered legitimate for writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, these use cases are now all obsolete and the same can be achieved by other means.\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Computing slow Set or Sorted set operations and storing the result in temporary local keys using commands like [`SUNIONSTORE`](/commands/sunionstore) and [`ZINTERSTORE`](/commands/zinterstore).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use commands that return the result without storing it, such as [`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and [`ZINTER`](/commands/zinter).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using the [`SORT`](/commands/sort) command (which is not considered a read-only command because of the optional STORE option and therefore cannot be used on a read-only replica).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`SORT_RO`](/commands/sort_ro), which is a read-only command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using [`EVAL`](/commands/eval) and [`EVALSHA`](/commands/evalsha) are also not considered read-only commands, because the Lua script may call write commands.\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`EVAL_RO`](/commands/eval_ro) and [`EVALSHA_RO`](/commands/evalsha_ro) where the Lua script can only call read-only commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile writes to a replica will be discarded if the replica and the master resync or if the replica is restarted, there is no guarantee that they will sync automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore version 4.0, writable replicas were incapable of expiring keys with a time to live set.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if you use [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) or other commands that set a maximum TTL for a key, the key will leak, and while you may no longer see it while accessing it with read commands, you will see it in the count of keys and it will still use memory.\\\\\\\\nRedis 4.0 RC3 and greater versions are able to evict keys with TTL as masters do, with the exceptions of keys written in DB numbers greater than 63 (but by default Redis instances only have 16 databases).\\\\\\\\nNote though that even in versions greater than 4.0, using [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) on a key that could ever exists on the master can cause inconsistency between the replica and the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that since Redis 4.0 replica writes are only local, and are not propagated to sub-replicas attached to the instance. Sub-replicas instead will always receive the replication stream identical to the one sent by the top-level master to the intermediate replicas.

The idea is that in a cluster with\\\\\\\\na master-replica setup, if the map between replicas and masters is fixed\\\\\\\\navailability is limited over time if multiple independent failures of single\\\\\\\\nnodes happen.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example in a cluster where every master has a single replica, the cluster\\\\\\\\ncan continue operations as long as either the master or the replica fail, but not\\\\\\\\nif both fail the same time. However there is a class of failures that are\\\\\\\\nthe independent failures of single nodes caused by hardware or software issues\\\\\\\\nthat can accumulate over time. For example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Master A has a single replica A1.\\\\\\\\n* Master A fails. A1 is promoted as new master.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails in an independent manner (unrelated to the failure of A). No other replica is available for promotion since node A is still down. The cluster cannot continue normal operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the map between masters and replicas is fixed, the only way to make the cluster\\\\\\\\nmore resistant to the above scenario is to add replicas to every master, however\\\\\\\\nthis is costly as it requires more instances of Redis to be executed, more\\\\\\\\nmemory, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn alternative is to create an asymmetry in the cluster, and let the cluster\\\\\\\\nlayout automatically change over time. For example the cluster may have three\\\\\\\\nmasters A, B, C. A and B have a single replica each, A1 and B1. However the master\\\\\\\\nC is different and has two replicas: C1 and C2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReplica migration is the process of automatic reconfiguration of a replica\\\\\\\\nin order to *migrate* to a master that has no longer coverage (no working\\\\\\\\nreplicas).

A1 is promoted.\\\\\\\\n* C2 migrates as replica of A1, that is otherwise not backed by any replica.\\\\\\\\n* Three hours later A1 fails as well.\\\\\\\\n* C2 is promoted as new master to replace A1.\\\\\\\\n* The cluster can continue the operations.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4997,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Safety of replication when master has persistence turned off\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In setups where Redis replication is used, it is strongly advised to have\\\\\\\\npersistence turned on in the master and in the replicas.

Check for Swapping**\n```bash\nredis-cli info | grep process_id\ncat /proc/<pid>/smaps | grep 'Swap:'\nvmstat 1\n```\n\n## Common Causes & Fixes\n\n**Transparent Huge Pages** (critical fix)\n```bash\necho never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\n```\nRestart Redis after disabling. This causes major latency spikes during fork operations.\n\n**Slow Commands**\n- Don't use `KEYS` in production - use `SCAN` family instead\n- Check algorithmic complexity before using unfamiliar commands\n- Run slow queries on replicas, not primary\n\n**Fork Operations** (BGSAVE/BGREWRITEAOF)\n- Use HVM-based EC2 instances (m3.medium or better), not old Xen instances\n- Avoid virtualization platforms with slow fork (old Xen has 239ms/GB vs 10ms/GB on physical)\n\n**AOF Configuration** (durability vs latency tradeoff)\n1. `appendfsync always` - slowest, strongest durability\n2. `appendfsync everysec` - good compromise (recommended)\n3. `appendfsync everysec` + `no-appendfsync-on-rewrite yes` - reduces disk pressure\n4. `appendfsync no` - lowest latency, relies on kernel fsync\n\n**Memory Swapping**\n- Ensure Redis memory < available RAM\n- Avoid running memory-hungry processes on same server\n- Check if non-trivial swap activity exists via `/proc/<pid>/smaps`\n\n**Expiration Spikes**\n- Avoid setting many keys to expire at the exact same second with `EXPIREAT`\n- Redis blocks if >25% of sampled keys expire simultaneously\n\n**Network Optimization**\n- Use Unix domain sockets if client is on same host\n- Keep connections long-lived (don't connect/disconnect repeatedly)\n- Use pipelining or aggregated commands (MSET/MGET)\n- Prefer physical machines over VMs for lowest latency\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency.md]\n[来源:

worst-case latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile Redis is an in-memory system, it deals with the operating system in\\\\\\\\ndifferent ways, for example, in the context of persisting to disk.\\\\\\\\nMoreover Redis implements a rich set of commands. Certain commands\\\\\\\\nare fast and run in constant or logarithmic time.

However, it poses\\\\\\\\na challenge for latency, since the single\\\\\\\\nthread must be able to perform certain tasks incrementally, for\\\\\\\\nexample key expiration, in a way that does not impact the other clients\\\\\\\\nthat are served.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor all these reasons, Redis 2.8.13 introduced a new feature called\\\\\\\\n**Latency Monitoring**, that helps the user to check and troubleshoot possible\\\\\\\\nlatency problems. Latency monitoring is composed of the following conceptual\\\\\\\\nparts:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Latency hooks that sample different latency-sensitive code paths.\\\\\\\\n* Time series recording of latency spikes, split by different events.\\\\\\\\n* Reporting engine to fetch raw data from the time series.\\\\\\\\n* Analysis engine to provide human-readable reports and hints according to the measurements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe rest of this document covers the latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\ndetails.

Other events are less generic and monitor\\\\\\\\nspecific operations performed by Redis. For example, the `fork` event\\\\\\\\nonly monitors the time taken by Redis to execute the `fork(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA latency spike is an event that takes more time to run than the configured latency\\\\\\\\nthreshold. There is a separate time series associated with every monitored\\\\\\\\nevent. This is how the time series work:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every time a latency spike happens, it is logged in the appropriate time series.\\\\\\\\n* Every time series is composed of 160 elements.\\\\\\\\n* Each element is a pair made of a Unix timestamp of the time the latency spike was measured and the number of milliseconds the event took to execute.\\\\\\\\n* Latency spikes for the same event that occur in the same second are merged by taking the maximum latency. Even if continuous latency spikes are measured for a given event, which could happen with a low threshold, at least 160 seconds of history are available.\\\\\\\\n* Records the all-time maximum latency for every element.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe framework monitors and logs latency spikes in the execution time of these events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `command`: regular commands.\\\\\\\\n* `fast-command`: O(1) and O(log N) commands.\\\\\\\\n* `fork`: the `fork(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n* `rdb-unlink-temp-file`: the `unlink(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-fsync-always`: the `fsync(2)` system call when invoked by the `appendfsync allways` policy.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write`: writing to the AOF - a catchall event for `write(2)` system calls.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write-pending-fsync`: the `write(2)` system call when there is a pending fsync.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write-active-child`: the `write(2)` system call when there are active child processes.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-write-alone`: the `write(2)` system call when no pending fsync and no active child process.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-fstat`: the `fstat(2)` system call.\\\\\\\\n* `aof-rename`: the `rename(2)` system call for renaming the temporary file after completing [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof).\\\\\\\\n* `aof-rewrite-diff-write`: writing the differences accumulated while performing [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof).\\\\\\\\n* `active-defrag-cycle`: the active defragmentation cycle.\\\\\\\\n* `expire-cycle`: the expiration cycle.\\\\\\\\n* `eviction-cycle`: the eviction cycle.\\\\\\\\n* `eviction-del`: deletes during the eviction cycle.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.1417,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"aa6407b9\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"aa6407b9-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Diagnosing latency issues\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This document will help you understand what the problem could be if you\\\\\\\\nare experiencing latency problems with Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this context *latency* is the maximum delay between the time a client\\\\\\\\nissues a command and the time the reply to the command is received by the\\\\\\\\nclient. Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for. However\\\\\\\\nthere is not just a single swap field since the smaps file contains the\\\\\\\\ndifferent memory maps of our Redis process (The memory layout of a process\\\\\\\\nis more complex than a simple linear array of pages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince we are interested in all the memory swapped by our process the first thing\\\\\\\\nto do is to grep for the Swap field across all the file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | grep \\'Swap:\\'\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf everything is 0 kB, or if there are sporadic 4k entries, everything is\\\\\\\\nperfectly normal.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server. The stack trace is different if the server blocks in a different context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you happen to collect multiple watchdog stack traces you are encouraged to send everything to the Redis Google Group: the more traces we obtain, the simpler it will be to understand what the problem with your instance is.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.5054,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1bdc4c21-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/latency-monitor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis latency monitoring\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Report information with the LATENCY command\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"What is high latency for one use case may not be considered high latency for another. Some applications may require that all queries be served in less than 1 millisecond. For other applications, it may be acceptable for a small amount of clients to experience a 2 second latency on occasion.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step to enable the latency monitor is to set a **latency threshold** in milliseconds. Only events that take longer than the specified threshold will be logged as latency spikes. The user should set the threshold according to their needs.

Configure Memory Limits\n\n- **Set `maxmemory`**: Always configure an explicit memory limit to prevent Redis from consuming all system memory. Calculate overhead for Redis operations and fragmentation - if you have 10GB free, set it to 8-9GB.\n- **Set eviction policy**: Configure `maxmemory-policy` (consider `noeviction` to return errors instead of silently evicting data)\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Memory allocation]\n\n## 2. Use Special Encoding for Small Data Types\n\nRedis automatically optimizes small aggregate data types, using **up to 10x less memory** (5x average):\n\n- **Hashes, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets**: When smaller than configured thresholds, Redis uses memory-efficient encoding\n- Configure thresholds in redis.conf:\n  - `hash-max-zipmap-entries 256`\n  - `hash-max-zipmap-value 1024`\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Special encoding]\n\n## 3. Use Hashes for Key-Value Storage\n\nInstead of many individual keys, use hashes with multiple fields:\n\n- **Memory savings**: Storing 100,000 objects as hash fields uses ~1.7MB vs 11MB as individual keys (6x reduction)\n- **Technique**: Split keys like `object:1234` into hash key `object:12` with field `34`\n- Each hash should contain ~100 fields for optimal CPU/memory tradeoff\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Using hashes]\n\n## 4. Use Bit/Byte Operations for Compact Storage\n\n- **Bitmaps**: Store boolean flags using `GETBIT`/`SETBIT` - 100 million users = only 12MB\n- **Byte arrays**: Use `GETRANGE`/`SETRANGE` for compact data representation\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Use hashes when possible]\n\n## 5. Vector Sets Memory Optimization\n\nFor vector similarity search, use quantization:\n\n| Mode | Memory Reduction | Recall | Use Case |\n|------|-----------------|--------|----------|\n| `Q8` | 4x smaller | High | Default - best tradeoff |\n| `BIN` | 32x smaller | Lower | Ultra-efficient, coarse search |\n| `NOQUANT` | Full size | Highest | Maximum precision |\n\n**Additional techniques**:\n- Lower HNSW `M` parameter to reduce graph connections\n- Use `REDUCE` option to apply random projection (e.g., 300D → 100D)\n- Minimize JSON attributes and use short labels\n\n[来源: redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md]\n\n## 6. Memory Allocation Considerations\n\n- **Peak memory provisioning**: Redis doesn't always return freed memory to OS - provision based on peak usage, not average\n- **Fragmentation**: After freeing data, allocators reuse memory chunks efficiently\n- **32-bit builds**: Use 32-bit Redis for <4GB datasets to save pointer space\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Memory allocation]\n\n## 7. System Configuration\n\n- Enable swap to detect memory pressure (prevents OOM kills)\n- Set `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` for background saves\n- Account for 2x memory usage during RDB saves/AOF rewrites in write-heavy workloads\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/admin.md > Redis setup tips]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RDB", "AOF", "user", "memory", "optimization", "encoding", "OBJECT", "MEMORY", "MULTI"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "78fa5b67-d3d4-431d-804e-2ebfea6b9cbe", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "6c68305e-c8c2-49f3-a4d9-51f328ca2941", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for Redis memory optimization best practices using multiple tools in parallel.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_pBKeqIyNPgsPHTIHajzRoJ', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'memory optimization|memory management|memory usage|maxmemory'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_XM2BczV1rzNEIrGoPidxlt', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis memory optimization best practices', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_pBKeqIyNPgsPHTIHajzRoJ', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_XM2BczV1rzNEIrGoPidxlt', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.4743,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"13dd8d5b-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"See also\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis vector sets are efficient, but vector similarity indexing and graph traversal require memory tradeoffs.

This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory error for write commands if and when it reaches the \\\\\\\\nlimit - which in turn may result in errors in the application but will not render the \\\\\\\\nwhole machine dead because of memory starvation.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.0146,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Special encoding of small aggregate data types\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Since Redis 2.2 many data types are optimized to use less space up to a certain size.\\\\\\\\nHashes, Lists, Sets composed of just integers, and Sorted Sets, when smaller than a given number of elements, and up to a maximum element size, are encoded in a very memory-efficient way that uses *up to 10 times less memory* (with 5 times less memory used being the average saving).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is completely transparent from the point of view of the user and API.\\\\\\\\nSince this is a CPU / memory tradeoff it is possible to tune the maximum \\\\\\\\nnumber of elements and maximum element size for special encoded types \\\\\\\\nusing the following redis.conf directives (defaults are shown):\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.9398,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"b7e8b170-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Memory optimization\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Using hashes to abstract a very memory-efficient plain key-value store on top of Redis\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"I understand the title of this section is a bit scary, but I\\'m going to explain in detail what this is about.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically it is possible to model a plain key-value store using Redis\\\\\\\\nwhere values can just be just strings, which is not just more memory efficient\\\\\\\\nthan Redis plain keys but also much more memory efficient than memcached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\'s start with some facts: a few keys use a lot more memory than a single key\\\\\\\\ncontaining a hash with a few fields. How is this possible? We use a trick.\\\\\\\\nIn theory to guarantee that we perform lookups in constant time\\\\\\\\n(also known as O(1) in big O notation) there is the need to use a data structure\\\\\\\\nwith a constant time complexity in the average case, like a hash table.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut many times hashes contain just a few fields. When hashes are small we can\\\\\\\\ninstead just encode them in an O(N) data structure, like a linear\\\\\\\\narray with length-prefixed key-value pairs. Since we do this only when N\\\\\\\\nis small, the amortized time for [`HGET`](/commands/hget) and [`HSET`](/commands/hset) commands is still O(1): the\\\\\\\\nhash will be converted into a real hash table as soon as the number of elements\\\\\\\\nit contains grows too large (you can configure the limit in redis.conf).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis does not only work well from the point of view of time complexity, but\\\\\\\\nalso from the point of view of constant times since a linear array of key-value pairs happens to play very well with the CPU cache (it has a better\\\\\\\\ncache locality than a hash table).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since hash fields and values are not (always) represented as full-featured Redis objects, hash fields can\\'t have an associated time to live\\\\\\\\n(expire) like a real key, and can only contain a string. But we are okay with\\\\\\\\nthis, this was the intention anyway when the hash data type API was\\\\\\\\ndesigned (we trust simplicity more than features, so nested data structures\\\\\\\\nare not allowed, as expires of single fields are not allowed).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo hashes are memory efficient. This is useful when using hashes\\\\\\\\nto represent objects or to model other problems when there are group of\\\\\\\\nrelated fields. But what about if we have a plain key value business?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nImagine we want to use Redis as a cache for many small objects, which can be JSON encoded objects, small HTML fragments, simple key -> boolean values\\\\\\\\nand so forth. Basically, anything is a string -> string map with small keys\\\\\\\\nand values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow let\\'s assume the objects we want to cache are numbered, like:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * object:102393\\\\\\\\n * object:1234\\\\\\\\n * object:5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what we can do. Every time we perform a\\\\\\\\nSET operation to set a new value, we actually split the key into two parts,\\\\\\\\none part used as a key, and the other part used as the field name for the hash. For instance, the\\\\\\\\nobject named \\\\\\\\\\\\\"object:1234\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is actually split into:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* a Key named object:12\\\\\\\\n* a Field named 34\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo we use all the characters but the last two for the key, and the final\\\\\\\\ntwo characters for the hash field name. To set our key we use the following\\\\\\\\ncommand:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nHSET object:12 34 somevalue\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see every hash will end up containing 100 fields, which is an optimal compromise between CPU and memory saved.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is another important thing to note, with this schema\\\\\\\\nevery hash will have more or\\\\\\\\nless 100 fields regardless of the number of objects we cached. This is because our objects will always end with a number and not a random string.

The second is that the top-level key space must\\\\\\\\nsupport a lot of interesting things like expires, LRU data, and so\\\\\\\\nforth so it is not practical to do this in a general way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBut the Redis Way is that the user must understand how things work so that he can pick the best compromise and to understand how the system will\\\\\\\\nbehave exactly.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6567,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"1a112c0f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/get-started/faq.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis FAQ\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Are Redis on-disk snapshots atomic?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Yes, a common design pattern involves taking very write-heavy small data\\\\\\\\nin Redis (and data you need the Redis data structures to model your problem\\\\\\\\nin an efficient way), and big *blobs* of data into an SQL or eventually\\\\\\\\nconsistent on-disk database. Similarly sometimes Redis is used in order to\\\\\\\\ntake in memory another copy of a subset of the same data stored in the on-disk\\\\\\\\ndatabase. This may look similar to caching, but actually is a more advanced model\\\\\\\\nsince normally the Redis dataset is updated together with the on-disk DB dataset,\\\\\\\\nand not refreshed on cache misses.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA good practice is to consider memory consumption when mapping your logical data model to the physical data model within Redis. These considerations include using specific data types, key patterns, and normalization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBeyond data modeling, there is more info in the [Memory Optimization page]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has built-in protections allowing the users to set a max limit on memory\\\\\\\\nusage, using the `maxmemory` option in the configuration file to put a limit\\\\\\\\nto the memory Redis can use. If this limit is reached, Redis will start to reply\\\\\\\\nwith an error to write commands (but will continue to accept read-only\\\\\\\\ncommands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also configure Redis to evict keys when the max memory limit\\\\\\\\nis reached. See the [eviction policy docs]() for more information on this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShort answer: `echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory` :)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now the long one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis background saving schema relies on the copy-on-write semantic of the `fork` system call in\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems: Redis forks (creates a child process) that is an\\\\\\\\nexact copy of the parent. The child process dumps the DB on disk and finally\\\\\\\\nexits. In theory the child should use as much memory as the parent being a\\\\\\\\ncopy, but actually thanks to the copy-on-write semantic implemented by most\\\\\\\\nmodern operating systems the parent and child process will _share_ the common\\\\\\\\nmemory pages. A page will be duplicated only when it changes in the child or in\\\\\\\\nthe parent. Since in theory all the pages may change while the child process is\\\\\\\\nsaving, Linux can\\'t tell in advance how much memory the child will take, so if\\\\\\\\nthe `overcommit_memory` setting is set to zero the fork will fail unless there is\\\\\\\\nas much free RAM as required to really duplicate all the parent memory pages.\\\\\\\\nIf you have a Redis dataset of 3 GB and just 2 GB of free\\\\\\\\nmemory it will fail.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSetting `overcommit_memory` to 1 tells Linux to relax and perform the fork in a\\\\\\\\nmore optimistic allocation fashion, and this is indeed what you want for Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can refer to the [proc(5)][proc5] man page for explanations of the\\\\\\\\navailable values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[proc5]: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, the Redis background saving process is always forked when the server is\\\\\\\\noutside of the execution of a command, so every command reported to be atomic\\\\\\\\nin RAM is also atomic from the point of view of the disk snapshot.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.6135,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

performance and resource utilization improvements, including significant memory and speed optimizations for lists, sets, and sorted sets. This new version adds a new `WITHSCORE` command argument for [ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank/) and [ZREVRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrevrank/), new commands, such as [CLIENT NO-TOUCH](https://redis.io/commands/client-no-touch/) for clients to run commands without affecting LRU/LFU of keys, and more. Redis 7.2 brings behavior changes by introducing a new format (version 11) for RDB files, which is incompatible with older versions, changing module API, and other changes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search and Query**:\\\\\\\\nThis new major version introduces the frequently asked [Geo Polygon](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#examples) Search. Adding the [GEOSHAPE](https://redis.io/commands/ft.create/) field type that supports polygon shapes using the [WKT notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry). In addition to the existing `GEO` for geo range queries, now an alias for `GEOPOINT`, we add `GEOSHAPE` with the support for `POLYGON` and `POINT` as new shapes formats and polygons operations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, 7.2 brings improvements in performance for `SORT BY` operations using [`FT.SEARCH`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/#optional-arguments) and [`FT.AGGREGATE`](https://redis.io/commands/ft.aggregate/#optional-arguments), and the new `FORMAT` for better readability and future support for better error handling responses on `FT.SEARCH` and `FT.AGGREGATE` in RESP3 only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**JSON**:\\\\\\\\nJSON introduces two new commands:\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MERGE](https://redis.io/commands/json.merge/) merges a given JSON value into matching paths so that the JSON values at the matching paths are updated, deleted, or expanded.\\\\\\\\n - [JSON.MSET](https://redis.io/commands/json.mset/) sets or updates one or more JSON values according to specified key-path-value triplets.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Graph**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGraph capabilities are no longer included in Redis Stack. See the [RedisGraph End-of-Life Announcement](https://redis.com/blog/redisgraph-eol/).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> [!WARNING]  \\\\\\\\nIf you are using graph capabilities with an older version of Redis Stack - please don\\'t upgrade.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Triggers and functions preview**:\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions is part of Redis Stack 7.2 as public preview, any feedback is highly appreciated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTriggers and functions provides support for running JavaScript functions inside the Redis process. These functions can be executed on-demand, by an event-driven trigger, or by a stream processing trigger. Triggers and functions empowers developers to build and maintain real-time applications by moving logic closer to the data, ensuring a lower latency whilst delivering the best developer experience.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTry it out with the [triggers and functions quick start](https://redis.io/docs/interact/programmability/triggers-and-functions/quick_start/).\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.9381,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"20fca0b7-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/admin.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis administration\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis setup tips > Replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* Deploy Redis using the Linux operating system. Redis is also tested on OS X, and from time to time on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However, Linux is where most of the stress testing is performed, and where most production deployments are run.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1. Add `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Then, reboot or run the command `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to activate the setting. See [FAQ: Background saving fails with a fork() error on Linux?]() for details. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* To ensure the Linux kernel feature Transparent Huge Pages does not impact Redis memory usage and latency, run the command: `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable it. See [Latency Diagnosis - Latency induced by transparent huge pages]() for additional context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Ensured that swap is enabled and that your swap file size is equal to amount of memory on your system. If Linux does not have swap set up, and your Redis instance accidentally consumes too much memory, Redis can crash when it is out of memory, or the Linux kernel OOM killer can kill the Redis process. When swapping is enabled, you can detect latency spikes and act on them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set an explicit `maxmemory` option limit in your instance to make sure that it will report errors instead of failing when the system memory limit is near to be reached. Note that `maxmemory` should be set by calculating the overhead for Redis, other than data, and the fragmentation overhead. So if you think you have 10 GB of free memory, set it to 8 or 9.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis in a write-heavy application, while saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log, Redis can use up to 2 times the memory normally used. The additional memory used is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make sure to size your memory accordingly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* See the [`LATENCY DOCTOR`](/commands/latency-doctor) and [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](/commands/memory-doctor) commands to assist in troubleshooting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When running under daemontools, use `daemonize no`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Set up a non-trivial replication backlog in proportion to the amount of memory Redis is using. The backlog allows replicas to sync with the primary (master) instance much more easily.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you use replication, Redis performs RDB saves even if persistence is disabled. (This does not apply to diskless replication.) If you don\\'t have disk usage on the master, enable diskless replication.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using replication, ensure that either your master has persistence enabled, or that it does not automatically restart on crashes. Replicas will try to maintain an exact copy of the master, so if a master restarts with an empty data set, replicas will be wiped as well.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4785,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7f44ec96-021\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Modules API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"String objects APIs > `RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation`\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"void RedisModule_TrimStringAllocation(RedisModuleString *str);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Available since:** 7.0.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTrim possible excess memory allocated for a `RedisModuleString`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes a `RedisModuleString` may have more memory allocated for\\\\\\\\nit than required, typically for argv arguments that were constructed\\\\\\\\nfrom network buffers.

Use Bit/Byte Operations for Compact Storage\n\n- **Bitmaps**: Store boolean flags using `GETBIT`/`SETBIT` - 100 million users = only 12MB\n- **Byte arrays**: Use `GETRANGE`/`SETRANGE` for compact data representation\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Use hashes when possible]\n\n## 5. Vector Sets Memory Optimization\n\nFor vector similarity search, use quantization:\n\n| Mode | Memory Reduction | Recall | Use Case |\n|------|-----------------|--------|----------|\n| `Q8` | 4x smaller | High | Default - best tradeoff |\n| `BIN` | 32x smaller | Lower | Ultra-efficient, coarse search |\n| `NOQUANT` | Full size | Highest | Maximum precision |\n\n**Additional techniques**:\n- Lower HNSW `M` parameter to reduce graph connections\n- Use `REDUCE` option to apply random projection (e.g., 300D → 100D)\n- Minimize JSON attributes and use short labels\n\n[来源: redis-docs/develop/data-types/vector-sets/memory.md]\n\n## 6. Memory Allocation Considerations\n\n- **Peak memory provisioning**: Redis doesn't always return freed memory to OS - provision based on peak usage, not average\n- **Fragmentation**: After freeing data, allocators reuse memory chunks efficiently\n- **32-bit builds**: Use 32-bit Redis for <4GB datasets to save pointer space\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Memory allocation]\n\n## 7. System Configuration\n\n- Enable swap to detect memory pressure (prevents OOM kills)\n- Set `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` for background saves\n- Account for 2x memory usage during RDB saves/AOF rewrites in write-heavy workloads\n\n[来源: redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/admin.md > Redis setup tips]", "session_id": "78fa5b67-d3d4-431d-804e-2ebfea6b9cbe", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 154813, "total_cost_usd": 0.06697375, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1485, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2971, "cache_read_input_tokens": 37160, "output_tokens": 896, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

CLIENT 命令系列\n- **`CLIENT LIST`** — 查看所有连接的客户端状态，包括地址、连接时长、空闲时间、内存使用等\n- **`CLIENT KILL`** — 关闭指定客户端连接\n- **`CLIENT SETNAME` / `CLIENT GETNAME`** — 设置/获取客户端连接名称，便于在日志中识别\n\n### 2. Lua 脚本调试\n- **`redis.debug()`** — 在 Lua 脚本中输出调试信息到 debug console\n  ```lua\n  local a = {1,2,3}\n  local b = false\n  redis.debug(a,b)  -- 输出: {1; 2; 3}, false\n  ```\n- **LDB (Lua Debugger)** — Redis 内置的 Lua 调试器，支持断点、单步执行、变量查看\n  - `print` 命令：查看局部变量\n  - `eval` 命令：执行 Lua 代码片段\n  - `continue` 命令：继续执行\n\n### 3. Vector Sets 调试（Redis 7.x+）\n- **`VSIM ... TRUTH`** — 使用线性扫描验证向量搜索结果准确性（慢但精确）\n- **`VGETATTR`** — 检查元素的属性，用于排查过滤器问题\n- **`VLINKS ... WITHSCORES`** — 检查 HNSW 图节点的连接情况\n\n### 4. 性能诊断\n- **`SLOWLOG`** — 查看慢查询日志（Redis 4.0+ 会显示客户端名称）\n\n## 常见调试场景\n\n| 问题 | 推荐工具 |\n|------|---------|\n| 查看客户端连接状态 | `CLIENT LIST` |\n| 识别延迟来源 | `SLOWLOG` + `CLIENT SETNAME` |\n| 调试 Lua 脚本 | `redis.debug()` 或 LDB |\n| 向量搜索召回率低 | `VSIM ...

It is a very powerful debugging tool if you use Redis at scale.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`CLIENT LIST`]() is used in order to obtain a list of connected clients and their state:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis 127.0.0.1:6379> client list\\\\\\\\naddr=127.0.0.1:52555 fd=5 name= age=855 idle=0 flags=N db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=-1 qbuf=0 qbuf-free=32768 obl=0 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=client\\\\\\\\naddr=127.0.0.1:52787 fd=6 name= age=6 idle=5 flags=N db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=-1 qbuf=0 qbuf-free=0 obl=0 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=ping\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example two clients are connected to the Redis server. Let\\'s look at what some of the data returned represents:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **addr**: The client address, that is, the client IP and the remote port number it used to connect with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n* **fd**: The client socket file descriptor number.\\\\\\\\n* **name**: The client name as set by [`CLIENT SETNAME`]().\\\\\\\\n* **age**: The number of seconds the connection existed for.\\\\\\\\n* **idle**: The number of seconds the connection is idle.\\\\\\\\n* **flags**: The kind of client (N means normal client, check the [full list of flags]()).\\\\\\\\n* **omem**: The amount of memory used by the client for the output buffer.\\\\\\\\n* **cmd**: The last executed command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSee the [[`CLIENT LIST`]()](/commands/client-list) documentation for the full listing of fields and their purpose.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce you have the list of clients, you can close a client\\'s connection using the [`CLIENT KILL`]() command, specifying the client address as its argument.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe commands [`CLIENT SETNAME`]() and [`CLIENT GETNAME`]() can be used to set and get the connection name. Starting with Redis 4.0, the client name is shown in the\\\\\\\\n[`SLOWLOG`]() output, to help identify clients that create latency issues.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom version 3.2 onwards, Redis has TCP keepalive (`SO_KEEPALIVE` socket option) enabled by default and set to about 300 seconds. This option is useful in order to detect dead peers (clients that cannot be reached even if they look connected). Moreover, if there is network equipment between clients and servers that need to see some traffic in order to take the connection open, the option will prevent unexpected connection closed events.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='根据检索结果，Redis debugging 有以下常用工具和命令：\\n\\n## 核心调试命令\\n\\n### 1.

If you use AOF persistence, the files will be named `appendonly.aof.*` and they will be written in the `appendonlydir` directory inside the data directory. The AOF-related directory and file names are the defaults. Use the names defined in your `redis.conf` file if different from the defaults.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the following command on each node to identify where your data directories are located:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\nredis-cli -p <port> CONFIG GET dir\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake a copy of the files contained in each of those directories before proceeding.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpgrade each node one at a time, starting with the replicas, using these steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Stop the current version of Redis Open Source or Redis Stack server.\\\\\\\\n1. Follow the installation steps that correspond to your [Redis distribution]() to install Redis 8.\\\\\\\\n1.

Upgrade Replicas First\nUpgrade each replica node one at a time:\n1. Stop the current Redis server\n2. Install Redis 8 following your distribution's installation steps\n3. Start Redis 8 (if it didn't start automatically)\n4. Restore saved files if necessary and restart\n\nThis is straightforward since clients can reconnect to other replicas if one is unavailable.\n\n### 3. Upgrade Masters (Zero-Downtime Method)\nFor each master node:\n\n1. **Trigger manual failover** to promote a replica to master:\n   ```bash\n   CLUSTER FAILOVER\n   ```\n2. **Wait for the old master to become a replica**\n3. **Upgrade the node** (now a replica) using the same steps as replica upgrades\n4. **(Optional)** Trigger another manual failover to restore the upgraded node as master\n\nRepeat this process for each master node until all nodes are upgraded.\n\n### 4. Verification\nAfter upgrading all nodes:\n```bash\nredis-cli -p <port> INFO server | grep redis_version\nredis-cli -p <port> cluster info\nredis-cli --cluster check <IP address>:<port>\n```\n\nVerify that your data is accessible and clients can connect successfully.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n⚠️ **Practice first**: Test the upgrade in a controlled environment (e.g., Docker) before upgrading production.\n\n⚠️ **Redis Query Engine**: Won't be fully operational until all master shards complete their upgrades. Queries during upgrade may return errors or \"Waiting for all nodes to connect\" messages.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/install/upgrade/cluster.md > Verify the upgrade]\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md > Upgrade nodes in a Redis Cluster]", "session_id": "1df9df5f-6ae6-4caa-9377-95564a554962", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 91706, "total_cost_usd": 0.051642999999999994, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1223, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2448, "cache_read_input_tokens": 30606, "output_tokens": 597, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

Graceful shutdown signals:\n- Redis doesn't exit immediately when receiving these signals\n- Instead, it schedules a shutdown similar to the `SHUTDOWN` command\n- The shutdown starts as soon as the current command completes (with max 0.1s delay)\n- If blocked by a long-running Lua script, use `SCRIPT KILL` first\n\n## Graceful Shutdown Process\n\nWhen Redis receives SIGTERM/SIGINT, it performs these actions:\n\n1. **Replication sync** (Redis 7.0+):\n   - Pauses write clients using `CLIENT PAUSE` with WRITE option\n   - Waits up to `shutdown-timeout` (default 10 seconds) for replicas to catch up\n   - This minimizes data loss risk in diskless setups\n\n2. **Background processes**:\n   - Kills any child process doing RDB save or AOF rewrite\n\n3. **AOF flush**:\n   - If AOF is active, calls `fsync` to flush buffers to disk\n\n4. **RDB persistence**:\n   - Performs synchronous (blocking) RDB save if configured\n   - **Important**: If RDB save fails, shutdown is aborted to prevent data loss\n\n5. **Cleanup**:\n   - Removes PID file (if daemonized)\n   - Removes Unix domain socket (if enabled)\n   - Exits with code 0\n\n## Crash Signals\n\nThese signals trigger crash handling (not graceful):\n- **SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL**\n\nActions on crash:\n- Logs bug report with stack trace and client state\n- Runs fast memory test (Redis 2.8+)\n- Removes PID file\n- Re-sends signal to itself for default action (core dump)\n\n## Special Signal\n\n**SIGUSR1** (Redis 2.6.10+):\n- Kills RDB-saving child process without triggering error condition\n- Parent continues accepting write commands normally\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md > SIGTERM and SIGINT, Kill the RDB file without errors]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RDB", "AOF", "replication", "replica", "memory", "MEMORY", "signal", "SIGTERM", "shutdown", "Lua", "script"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "47215eb4-2008-4033-a3a3-c00a4e689078", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "a6f6d50b-ced9-4e9a-ae5d-ac717705b977", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Redis signal handling and graceful shutdown.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_vie0K79ng1d3fUjLYF8i08', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'signal|SIGTERM|SIGINT|shutdown'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_iZyu33mZp5wF8TaiEbZh3i', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Redis signal handling graceful shutdown SIGTERM SIGINT', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_vie0K79ng1d3fUjLYF8i08', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_iZyu33mZp5wF8TaiEbZh3i', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.5927,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis signal handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"SIGTERM and SIGINT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"This document provides information about how Redis reacts to different POSIX signals such as `SIGTERM` and `SIGSEGV`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe information in this document **only applies to Redis version 2.6 or greater**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals tell Redis to shut down gracefully. When the server receives this signal,\\\\\\\\nit does not immediately exit. Instead, it schedules\\\\\\\\na shutdown similar to the one performed by the [`SHUTDOWN`](/commands/shutdown) command. The scheduled shutdown starts as soon as possible, specifically as long as the\\\\\\\\ncurrent command in execution terminates (if any), with a possible additional\\\\\\\\ndelay of 0.1 seconds or less.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the server is blocked by a long-running Lua script,\\\\\\\\nkill the script with [`SCRIPT KILL`](/commands/script-kill) if possible. The scheduled shutdown will\\\\\\\\nrun just after the script is killed or terminates spontaneously.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis shutdown process includes the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If there are any replicas lagging behind in replication:\\\\\\\\n  * Pause clients attempting to write with [`CLIENT PAUSE`](/commands/client-pause) and the `WRITE` option.\\\\\\\\n  * Wait up to the configured `shutdown-timeout` (default 10 seconds) for replicas to catch up with the master\\'s replication offset.\\\\\\\\n* If a background child is saving the RDB file or performing an AOF rewrite, the child process is killed.\\\\\\\\n* If the AOF is active, Redis calls the `fsync` system call on the AOF file descriptor to flush the buffers on disk.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis is configured to persist on disk using RDB files, a synchronous (blocking) save is performed. Since the save is synchronous, it doesn\\'t use any additional memory.\\\\\\\\n* If the server is daemonized, the PID file is removed.\\\\\\\\n* If the Unix domain socket is enabled, it gets removed.\\\\\\\\n* The server exits with an exit code of zero.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIF the RDB file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails, and the server continues to run in order to ensure no data loss.\\\\\\\\nLikewise, if the user just turned on AOF, and the server triggered the first AOF rewrite in order to create the initial AOF file but this file can\\'t be saved, the shutdown fails and the server continues to run.\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.6.11, no further attempt to shut down will be made unless a new `SIGTERM` is received or the [`SHUTDOWN`](/commands/shutdown) command is issued.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 7.0, the server waits for lagging replicas up to a configurable `shutdown-timeout`, 10 seconds by default, before shutting down.\\\\\\\\nThis provides a best effort to minimize the risk of data loss in a situation where no save points are configured and AOF is deactivated.\\\\\\\\nBefore version 7.0, shutting down a heavily loaded master node in a diskless setup was more likely to result in data loss.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risk of data loss in such setups, trigger a manual [`FAILOVER`](/commands/failover) (or [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)) to demote the master to a replica and promote one of the replicas to a new master before shutting down a master node.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.7774,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"93fe9168-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis signal handling\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Kill the RDB file without errors\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The following signals are handled as a Redis crash:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* SIGSEGV\\\\\\\\n* SIGBUS\\\\\\\\n* SIGFPE\\\\\\\\n* SIGILL\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce one of these signals is trapped, Redis stops any current operation and performs the following actions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Adds a bug report to the log file. This includes a stack trace, dump of registers, and information about the state of clients.\\\\\\\\n* Since Redis 2.8, a fast memory test is performed as a first check of the reliability of the crashing system.\\\\\\\\n* If the server was daemonized, the PID file is removed.\\\\\\\\n* Finally the server unregisters its own signal handler for the received signal and resends the same signal to itself to make sure that the default action is performed, such as dumping the core on the file system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the child performing the Append Only File rewrite gets killed by a signal,\\\\\\\\nRedis handles this as an error and discards the (probably partial or corrupted)\\\\\\\\nAOF file. It will attempt the rewrite again later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen the child performing an RDB save is killed, Redis handles the\\\\\\\\ncondition as a more severe error. While the failure of an\\\\\\\\nAOF file rewrite can cause AOF file enlargement, failed RDB file\\\\\\\\ncreation reduces durability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result of the child producing the RDB file being killed by a signal,\\\\\\\\nor when the child exits with an error (non zero exit code), Redis enters\\\\\\\\na special error condition where no further write command is accepted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis will continue to reply to read commands.\\\\\\\\n* Redis will reply to all write commands with a `MISCONFIG` error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis error condition will persist until it becomes possible to create an RDB file successfully.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes the user may want to kill the RDB-saving child process without\\\\\\\\ngenerating an error.

This document describes the problem that pipelining is designed to solve and how pipelining works in Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis is a TCP server using the client-server model and what is called a *Request/Response* protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis means that usually a request is accomplished with the following steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The client sends a query to the server, and reads from the socket, usually in a blocking way, for the server response.\\\\\\\\n* The server processes the command and sends the response back to the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for instance a four commands sequence is something like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients and Servers are connected via a network link.\\\\\\\\nSuch a link can be very fast (a loopback interface) or very slow (a connection established over the Internet with many hops between the two hosts).\\\\\\\\nWhatever the network latency is, it takes time for the packets to travel from the client to the server, and back from the server to the client to carry the reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time is called RTT (Round Trip Time).\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s easy to see how this can affect performance when a client needs to perform many requests in a row (for instance adding many elements to the same list, or populating a database with many keys).\\\\\\\\nFor instance if the RTT time is 250 milliseconds (in the case of a very slow link over the Internet), even if the server is able to process 100k requests per second, we\\'ll be able to process at max four requests per second.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the interface used is a loopback interface, the RTT is much shorter, typically sub-millisecond, but even this will add up to a lot if you need to perform many writes in a row.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately there is a way to improve this use case.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.3042,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Appendix: Why are busy loops slow even on the loopback interface?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"In the following benchmark we\\'ll use the Redis Ruby client, supporting pipelining, to test the speed improvement due to pipelining:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```ruby\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'rubygems\\'\\\\\\\\nrequire \\'redis\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef bench(descr)\\\\\\\\n  start = Time.now\\\\\\\\n  yield\\\\\\\\n  puts \\\\\\\\\\\\\"#{descr} #{Time.now -

The wise thing is just avoiding\\\\\\\\nbenchmarking in this way.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.7964,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e716055e-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/pipelining.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis pipelining\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"It\\'s not just a matter of RTT\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Request/Response server can be implemented so that it is able to process new requests even if the client hasn\\'t already read the old responses.\\\\\\\\nThis way it is possible to send *multiple commands* to the server without waiting for the replies at all, and finally read the replies in a single step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is called pipelining, and is a technique widely in use for many decades.\\\\\\\\nFor instance many POP3 protocol implementations already support this feature, dramatically speeding up the process of downloading new emails from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has supported pipelining since its early days, so whatever version you are running, you can use pipelining with Redis.\\\\\\\\nThis is an example using the raw netcat utility:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash \\\\\\\\n$ (printf \\\\\\\\\\\\\"PING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nPING\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"; sleep 1) | nc localhost 6379\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n+PONG\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time we don\\'t pay the cost of RTT for every call, but just once for the three commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be explicit, with pipelining the order of operations of our very first example will be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Client:* INCR X\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 1\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 2\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 3\\\\\\\\n * *Server:* 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the client sends commands using pipelining, the server will be forced to queue the replies, using memory. So if you need to send a lot of commands with pipelining, it is better to send them as batches each containing a reasonable number, for instance 10k commands, read the replies, and then send another 10k commands again, and so forth. The speed will be nearly the same, but the additional memory used will be at most the amount needed to queue the replies for these 10k commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPipelining is not just a way to reduce the latency cost associated with the\\\\\\\\nround trip time, it actually greatly improves the number of operations\\\\\\\\nyou can perform per second in a given Redis server.\\\\\\\\nThis is because without using pipelining, serving each command is very cheap from\\\\\\\\nthe point of view of accessing the data structures and producing the reply,\\\\\\\\nbut it is very costly from the point of view of doing the socket I/O. This\\\\\\\\ninvolves calling the `read()` and `write()` syscall, that means going from user\\\\\\\\nland to kernel land.\\\\\\\\nThe context switch is a huge speed penalty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen pipelining is used, many commands are usually read with a single `read()`\\\\\\\\nsystem call, and multiple replies are delivered with a single `write()` system\\\\\\\\ncall. Consequently, the number of total queries performed per second\\\\\\\\ninitially increases almost linearly with longer pipelines, and eventually\\\\\\\\nreaches 10 times the baseline obtained without pipelining, as shown in this figure.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8792,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"e1c7f6a2-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/stack-with-enterprise/search/query-performance-factor.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Query Performance Factor\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sizing\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Query performance factors are intended to increase the performance of queries, including [vector search]().

Here's how they work:\n\n### Basic Mechanism\n\n1. **MULTI** - Starts a transaction. All subsequent commands are queued instead of executed immediately.\n2. **Commands** - Each command returns `QUEUED` instead of executing.\n3. **EXEC** - Executes all queued commands sequentially as a single atomic operation.\n4. **DISCARD** - Aborts the transaction and clears the command queue.\n\n### Example\n\n```redis\n> MULTI\nOK\n> INCR foo\nQUEUED\n> INCR bar\nQUEUED\n> EXEC\n1) (integer) 1\n2) (integer) 2\n```\n\n### Key Guarantees\n\n**Atomicity**: All commands in a transaction are serialized and executed sequentially. No other client's request can interrupt the execution - they run as a single isolated operation.\n\n**All-or-nothing execution**: If a client loses connection before calling EXEC, none of the operations are performed. If EXEC is called, all operations are performed.\n\n### Error Handling\n\n- **Syntax errors** (before EXEC): Detected during command queuing.

A request sent by another client will never be\\\\\\\\nserved **in the middle** of the execution of a Redis Transaction.\\\\\\\\nThis guarantees that the commands are executed as a single\\\\\\\\nisolated operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The [`EXEC`]() command\\\\\\\\ntriggers the execution of all the commands in the transaction, so\\\\\\\\nif a client loses the connection to the server in the context of a\\\\\\\\ntransaction before calling the [`EXEC`]() command none of the operations\\\\\\\\nare performed, instead if the [`EXEC`]() command is called, all the\\\\\\\\noperations are performed. When using the\\\\\\\\n[append-only file]() Redis makes sure\\\\\\\\nto use a single write(2) syscall to write the transaction on disk.\\\\\\\\nHowever if the Redis server crashes or is killed by the system administrator\\\\\\\\nin some hard way it is possible that only a partial number of operations\\\\\\\\nare registered. Redis will detect this condition at restart, and will exit with an error.\\\\\\\\nUsing the `redis-check-aof` tool it is possible to fix the\\\\\\\\nappend only file that will remove the partial transaction so that the\\\\\\\\nserver can start again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStarting with version 2.2, Redis allows for an extra guarantee to the\\\\\\\\nabove two, in the form of optimistic locking in a way very similar to a\\\\\\\\ncheck-and-set (CAS) operation.\\\\\\\\nThis is documented [later](#cas) on this page.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis Transaction is entered using the [`MULTI`]() command. The command\\\\\\\\nalways replies with `OK`. At this point the user can issue multiple\\\\\\\\ncommands. Instead of executing these commands, Redis will queue\\\\\\\\nthem. All the commands are executed once [`EXEC`]() is called.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalling [`DISCARD`]() instead will flush the transaction queue and will exit\\\\\\\\nthe transaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following example increments keys `foo` and `bar` atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> MULTI\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> INCR foo\\\\\\\\nQUEUED\\\\\\\\n> INCR bar\\\\\\\\nQUEUED\\\\\\\\n> EXEC\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs is clear from the session above, [`EXEC`]() returns an\\\\\\\\narray of replies, where every element is the reply of a single command\\\\\\\\nin the transaction, in the same order the commands were issued.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a Redis connection is in the context of a [`MULTI`]() request,\\\\\\\\nall commands will reply with the string `QUEUED` (sent as a Status Reply\\\\\\\\nfrom the point of view of the Redis protocol).

Otherwise, if the client elected to proceed with the transaction\\\\\\\\nthe [`EXEC`]() command would execute all commands queued successfully regardless of previous errors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nErrors happening *after* [`EXEC`]() instead are not handled in a special way:\\\\\\\\nall the other commands will be executed even if some command fails during the transaction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is more clear on the protocol level. In the following example one\\\\\\\\ncommand will fail when executed even if the syntax is right:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\\\\\\\\nConnected to localhost.\\\\\\\\nEscape character is \\'^]\\'.\\\\\\\\nMULTI\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\nSET a abc\\\\\\\\n+QUEUED\\\\\\\\nLPOP a\\\\\\\\n+QUEUED\\\\\\\\nEXEC\\\\\\\\n*2\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n-WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`EXEC`]() returned two-element [bulk string reply]() where one is an `OK` code and\\\\\\\\nthe other an error reply. It\\'s up to the client library to find a\\\\\\\\nsensible way to provide the error to the user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt\\'s important to note that\\\\\\\\n**even when a command fails, all the other commands in the queue are processed** – Redis will _not_ stop the\\\\\\\\nprocessing of commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother example, again using the wire protocol with `telnet`, shows how\\\\\\\\nsyntax errors are reported ASAP instead:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nMULTI\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\nINCR a b c\\\\\\\\n-ERR wrong number of arguments for \\'incr\\' command\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis time due to the syntax error the bad [`INCR`]() command is not queued\\\\\\\\nat all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis does not support rollbacks of transactions since supporting rollbacks\\\\\\\\nwould have a significant impact on the simplicity and performance of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`DISCARD`]() can be used in order to abort a transaction. In this case, no\\\\\\\\ncommands are executed and the state of the connection is restored to\\\\\\\\nnormal.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> SET foo 1\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> MULTI\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> INCR foo\\\\\\\\nQUEUED\\\\\\\\n> DISCARD\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n> GET foo\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"cas\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.4625,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"c8ce5dac-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/using-commands/transactions.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Transactions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Optimistic locking using check-and-set\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"[`WATCH`]() is used to provide a check-and-set (CAS) behavior to Redis\\\\\\\\ntransactions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[`WATCH`]()ed keys are monitored in order to detect changes against them. If\\\\\\\\nat least one watched key is modified before the [`EXEC`]() command, the\\\\\\\\nwhole transaction aborts, and [`EXEC`]() returns a [Null reply]() to notify that\\\\\\\\nthe transaction failed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, imagine we have the need to atomically increment the value\\\\\\\\nof a key by 1 (let\\'s suppose Redis doesn\\'t have [`INCR`]()).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first try may be the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nval = GET mykey\\\\\\\\nval = val + 1\\\\\\\\nSET mykey $val\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis will work reliably only if we have a single client performing the\\\\\\\\noperation in a given time. If multiple clients try to increment the key\\\\\\\\nat about the same time there will be a race condition. For instance,\\\\\\\\nclient A and B will read the old value, for instance, 10. The value will\\\\\\\\nbe incremented to 11 by both the clients, and finally [`SET`]() as the value\\\\\\\\nof the key. So the final value will be 11 instead of 12.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThanks to [`WATCH`]() we are able to model the problem very well:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nWATCH mykey\\\\\\\\nval = GET mykey\\\\\\\\nval = val + 1\\\\\\\\nMULTI\\\\\\\\nSET mykey $val\\\\\\\\nEXEC\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the above code, if there are race conditions and another client\\\\\\\\nmodifies the result of `val` in the time between our call to [`WATCH`]() and\\\\\\\\nour call to [`EXEC`](), the transaction will fail.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe just have to repeat the operation hoping this time we\\'ll not get a\\\\\\\\nnew race.

Default Mode (Memory-based tracking)**\n- Server remembers which keys each client accessed\n- Sends invalidation messages only for keys the client might have cached\n- Costs memory on server side but is more efficient with invalidation messages\n\n**2. Broadcasting Mode**\n- Server doesn't track individual client access\n- Zero memory cost on server side\n- Clients subscribe to key prefixes (e.g., `object:`, `user:`)\n- Receives notifications for all keys matching subscribed prefixes\n\n## How Tracking Works\n\n1. **Enable tracking**: `CLIENT TRACKING ON`\n2. **Server tracks reads**: When client requests keys (e.g., `GET foo`), server remembers this\n3. **Invalidation on modification**: When a key is modified, evicted, or expires, server sends invalidation messages to all tracking clients\n4. **Client evicts cache**: Clients must remove invalidated keys to avoid serving stale data\n\n**Example protocol flow:**\n```\nClient 1 -> Server: CLIENT TRACKING ON\nClient 1 -> Server: GET foo\n(Server remembers Client 1 may have \"foo\" cached)\nClient 2 -> Server: SET foo SomeOtherValue\nServer -> Client 1: INVALIDATE \"foo\"\n```\n\n## Key Implementation Details\n\n**Invalidation Table**: Server uses a global table with maximum entries.

This costs memory in the server side, but sends invalidation messages only for the set of keys that the client might have in memory.\\\\\\\\n* In the _broadcasting_ mode, the server does not attempt to remember what keys a given client accessed, so this mode costs no memory at all in the server side. Instead clients subscribe to key prefixes such as `object:` or `user:`, and receive a notification message every time a key matching a subscribed prefix is touched.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo recap, for now let\\'s forget for a moment about the broadcasting mode, to\\\\\\\\nfocus on the first mode. We\\'ll describe broadcasting in more detail later.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Clients can enable tracking if they want. Connections start without tracking enabled.\\\\\\\\n2. When tracking is enabled, the server remembers what keys each client requested during the connection lifetime (by sending read commands about such keys).\\\\\\\\n3. When a key is modified by some client, or is evicted because it has an associated expire time, or evicted because of a _maxmemory_ policy, all the clients with tracking enabled that may have the key cached, are notified with an _invalidation message_.\\\\\\\\n4. When clients receive invalidation messages, they are required to remove the corresponding keys, in order to avoid serving stale data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of the protocol:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: CLIENT TRACKING ON\\\\\\\\n* Client 1 `->` Server: GET foo\\\\\\\\n* (The server remembers that Client 1 may have the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" cached)\\\\\\\\n* (Client 1 may remember the value of \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" inside its local memory)\\\\\\\\n* Client 2 `->` Server: SET foo SomeOtherValue\\\\\\\\n* Server `->` Client 1: INVALIDATE \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis looks great superficially, but if you imagine 10k connected clients all\\\\\\\\nasking for millions of keys over long living connection, the server ends up\\\\\\\\nstoring too much information. For this reason Redis uses two key ideas in\\\\\\\\norder to limit the amount of memory used server-side and the CPU cost of\\\\\\\\nhandling the data structures implementing the feature:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The server remembers the list of clients that may have cached a given key in a single global table. This table is called the **Invalidation Table**. The invalidation table can contain a maximum number of entries. If a new key is inserted, the server may evict an older entry by pretending that such key was modified (even if it was not), and sending an invalidation message to the clients. Doing so, it can reclaim the memory used for this key, even if this will force the clients having a local copy of the key to evict it.\\\\\\\\n* Inside the invalidation table we don\\'t really need to store pointers to clients\\' structures, that would force a garbage collection procedure when the client disconnects: instead what we do is just store client IDs (each Redis client has a unique numerical ID). If a client disconnects, the information will be incrementally garbage collected as caching slots are invalidated.\\\\\\\\n* There is a single keys namespace, not divided by database numbers. So if a client is caching the key `foo` in database 2, and some other client changes the value of the key `foo` in database 3, an invalidation message will still be sent. This way we can ignore database numbers reducing both the memory usage and the implementation complexity.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 5.1171,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"The NOLOOP option\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"So far we described the first client-side caching model that Redis implements.\\\\\\\\nThere is another one, called broadcasting, that sees the problem from the\\\\\\\\npoint of view of a different tradeoff, does not consume any memory on the\\\\\\\\nserver side, but instead sends more invalidation messages to clients.\\\\\\\\nIn this mode we have the following main behaviors:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients enable client-side caching using the `BCAST` option, specifying one or more prefixes using the `PREFIX` option. For instance: `CLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 10 BCAST PREFIX object: PREFIX user:`. If no prefix is specified at all, the prefix is assumed to be the empty string, so the client will receive invalidation messages for every key that gets modified. Instead if one or more prefixes are used, only keys matching one of the specified prefixes will be sent in the invalidation messages.\\\\\\\\n* The server does not store anything in the invalidation table. Instead it uses a different **Prefixes Table**, where each prefix is associated to a list of clients.\\\\\\\\n* No two prefixes can track overlapping parts of the keyspace. For instance, having the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foob\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would not be allowed, since they would both trigger an invalidation for the key \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foobar\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, just using the prefix \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is sufficient.\\\\\\\\n* Every time a key matching any of the prefixes is modified, all the clients subscribed to that prefix, will receive the invalidation message.\\\\\\\\n* The server will consume CPU proportional to the number of registered prefixes. If you have just a few, it is hard to see any difference. With a big number of prefixes the CPU cost can become quite large.\\\\\\\\n* In this mode the server can perform the optimization of creating a single reply for all the clients subscribed to a given prefix, and send the same reply to all. This helps to lower the CPU usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default client-side tracking will send invalidation messages to the\\\\\\\\nclient that modified the key. Sometimes clients want this, since they\\\\\\\\nimplement very basic logic that does not involve automatically caching\\\\\\\\nwrites locally. However, more advanced clients may want to cache even the\\\\\\\\nwrites they are doing in the local in-memory table. In such case receiving\\\\\\\\nan invalidation message immediately after the write is a problem, since it\\\\\\\\nwill force the client to evict the value it just cached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this case it is possible to use the `NOLOOP` option: it works both\\\\\\\\nin normal and broadcasting mode. Using this option, clients are able to\\\\\\\\ntell the server they don\\'t want to receive invalidation messages for keys\\\\\\\\nthat they modified.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.7535,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"6e575127-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/client-side-caching.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Client-side caching reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Two connections mode\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Using the new version of the Redis protocol, RESP3, supported by Redis 6, it is possible to run the data queries and receive the invalidation messages in the same connection. However many client implementations may prefer to implement client-side caching using two separated connections: one for data, and one for invalidation messages. For this reason when a client enables tracking, it can specify to redirect the invalidation messages to another connection by specifying the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"client ID\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of a different connection. Many data connections can redirect invalidation messages to the same connection, this is useful for clients implementing connection pooling. The two connections model is the only one that is also supported for RESP2 (which lacks the ability to multiplex different kind of information in the same connection).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of a complete session using the Redis protocol in the old RESP2 mode involving the following steps: enabling tracking redirecting to another connection, asking for a key, and getting an invalidation message once the key gets modified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo start, the client opens a first connection that will be used for invalidations, requests the connection ID, and subscribes via Pub/Sub to the special channel that is used to get invalidation messages when in RESP2 modes (remember that RESP2 is the usual Redis protocol, and not the more advanced protocol that you can use, optionally, with Redis 6 using the [`HELLO`]() command):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT ID\\\\\\\\n:4\\\\\\\\nSUBSCRIBE __redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$9\\\\\\\\nsubscribe\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow we can enable tracking from the data connection:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 2 -- data connection)\\\\\\\\nCLIENT TRACKING on REDIRECT 4\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGET foo\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nbar\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client may decide to cache `\\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" => \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` in the local memory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA different client will now modify the value of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"foo\\\\\\\\\\\\\" key:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Some other unrelated connection)\\\\\\\\nSET foo bar\\\\\\\\n+OK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a result, the invalidations connection will receive a message that invalidates the specified key.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n(Connection 1 -- used for invalidations)\\\\\\\\n*3\\\\\\\\n$7\\\\\\\\nmessage\\\\\\\\n$20\\\\\\\\n__redis__:invalidate\\\\\\\\n*1\\\\\\\\n$3\\\\\\\\nfoo\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe client will check if there are cached keys in this caching slot, and will evict the information that is no longer valid.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that the third element of the Pub/Sub message is not a single key but\\\\\\\\nis a Redis array with just a single element. Since we send an array, if there\\\\\\\\nare groups of keys to invalidate, we can do that in a single message.\\\\\\\\nIn case of a flush ([`FLUSHALL`]() or [`FLUSHDB`]()), a `null` message will be sent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA very important thing to understand about client-side caching used with\\\\\\\\nRESP2 and a Pub/Sub connection in order to read the invalidation messages,\\\\\\\\nis that using Pub/Sub is entirely a trick **in order to reuse old client\\\\\\\\nimplementations**, but actually the message is not really sent to a channel\\\\\\\\nand received by all the clients subscribed to it.

Yet the application\\\\\\\\nmay continue to serve the old username for user:1234.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes, depending on the exact application we are modeling, this isn\\'t a\\\\\\\\nbig deal, so the client will just use a fixed maximum \\\\\\\\\\\\\"time to live\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for the\\\\\\\\ncached information.

In order to avoid\\\\\\\\nthis problem, we need to do the following things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure that if the connection is lost, the local cache is flushed.\\\\\\\\n2. Both when using RESP2 with Pub/Sub, or RESP3, ping the invalidation channel periodically (you can send PING commands even when the connection is in Pub/Sub mode!). If the connection looks broken and we are not able to receive ping backs, after a maximum amount of time, close the connection and flush the cache.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients may want to run internal statistics about the number of times\\\\\\\\na given cached key was actually served in a request, to understand in the\\\\\\\\nfuture what is good to cache. In general:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that change continuously.\\\\\\\\n* We don\\'t want to cache many keys that are requested very rarely.\\\\\\\\n* We want to cache keys that are requested often and change at a reasonable rate. For an example of key not changing at a reasonable rate, think of a global counter that is continuously [`INCR`]()emented.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever simpler clients may just evict data using some random sampling just\\\\\\\\nremembering the last time a given cached value was served, trying to evict\\\\\\\\nkeys that were not served recently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Handling TTLs: make sure you also request the key TTL and set the TTL in the local cache if you want to support caching keys with a TTL.\\\\\\\\n* Putting a max TTL on every key is a good idea, even if it has no TTL.

employ programmatic control structures and use most of the [commands]() while executing to access the database.\\\\\\\\nBecause scripts execute in the server, reading and writing data from scripts is very efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis guarantees the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\nWhile executing the script, all server activities are blocked during its entire runtime.\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripting offers several properties that can be valuable in many cases.\\\\\\\\nThese include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Providing locality by executing logic where data lives. Data locality reduces overall latency and saves networking resources.\\\\\\\\n* Blocking semantics that ensure the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\n* Enabling the composition of simple capabilities that are either missing from Redis or are too niche to be a part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLua lets you run part of your application logic inside Redis.\\\\\\\\nSuch scripts can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine.\\\\\\\\nPresently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference]() page for complete documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough the server executes them, Eval scripts are regarded as a part of the client-side application, which is why they\\'re not named, versioned, or persisted.\\\\\\\\nSo all scripts may need to be reloaded by the application at any time if missing (after a server restart, fail-over to a replica, etc.).\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, [Redis Functions]() offer an alternative approach to programmability which allow the server itself to be extended with additional programmed logic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll start scripting with Redis by using the [`EVAL`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s our first example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello, scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, [`EVAL`]() takes two arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe first argument is a string that consists of the script\\'s Lua source code.\\\\\\\\nThe script doesn\\'t need to include any definitions of Lua function.\\\\\\\\nIt is just a Lua program that will run in the Redis engine\\'s context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second argument is the number of arguments that follow the script\\'s body, starting from the third argument, representing Redis key names.\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we used the value _0_ because we didn\\'t provide the script with any arguments, whether the names of keys or not.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.983,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"15b2f0ac-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/functions-intro.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis functions\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Prologue (or, what\\'s wrong with Eval Scripts?)\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Functions is an API for managing code to be executed on the server. This feature, which became available in Redis 7, supersedes the use of [EVAL]() in prior versions of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior versions of Redis made scripting available only via the [`EVAL`]() command, which allows a Lua script to be sent for execution by the server.\\\\\\\\nThe core use cases for [Eval Scripts]() is executing part of your application logic inside Redis, efficiently and atomically.\\\\\\\\nSuch script can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing [`EVAL`]() requires that the application sends the entire script for execution every time.\\\\\\\\nBecause this results in network and script compilation overheads, Redis provides an optimization in the form of the [`EVALSHA`]() command. By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes to already-established and well-liked ephemeral scripts, Redis v7.0 introduces Redis Functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.9816,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

[`redis.pcall()`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe two are nearly identical.\\\\\\\\nBoth execute a Redis command along with its provided arguments, if these represent a well-formed command.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as generic as possible and provide customized execution via their arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA script is loaded to the server\\'s cache by calling the [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() command and providing its source code.\\\\\\\\nThe server doesn\\'t execute the script, but instead just compiles and loads it to the server\\'s cache.\\\\\\\\nOnce loaded, you can execute the cached script with the SHA1 digest returned from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example of loading and then executing a cached script:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> SCRIPT LOAD \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Immabe a cached

native Lua debugging.\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Lua debugger is a remote debugger consisting of a server, which is Redis itself, and a client, which is by default [`redis-cli`]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Lua debugger is described in the [Lua scripts debugging]() section of the Redis documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen memory usage in Redis exceeds the `maxmemory` limit, the first write command encountered in the script that uses additional memory will cause the script to abort (unless [`redis.pcall`]() was used).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, an exception to the above is when the script\\'s first write command does not use additional memory, as is the case with  (for example, [`DEL`]() and [`LREM`]()).\\\\\\\\nIn this case, Redis will allow all commands in the script to run to ensure atomicity.\\\\\\\\nIf subsequent writes in the script consume additional memory, Redis\\' memory usage can exceed the threshold set by the `maxmemory` configuration directive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother scenario in which a script can cause memory usage to cross the `maxmemory` threshold is when the execution begins when Redis is slightly below `maxmemory`, so the script\\'s first write command is allowed.\\\\\\\\nAs the script executes, subsequent write commands consume more memory leading to the server using more RAM than the configured `maxmemory` directive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn those scenarios, you should consider setting the `maxmemory-policy` configuration directive to any values other than `noeviction`.\\\\\\\\nIn addition, Lua scripts should be as fast as possible so that eviction can kick in between executions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that you can change this behaviour by using [flags](#eval-flags)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNormally, when you run an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nHowever, starting with Redis 7.0, there\\'s a way to declare flags when creating a script in order to tell Redis how it should behave.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe way to do that is by using a Shebang statement on the first line of the script like so:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n#!lua flags=no-writes,allow-stale\\\\\\\\nlocal x = redis.call(\\'get\\',\\'x\\')\\\\\\\\nreturn x\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that as soon as Redis sees the `#!` comment, it\\'ll treat the script as if it declares flags, even if no flags are defined,\\\\\\\\nit still has a different set of defaults compared to a script without a `#!` line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother difference is that scripts without `#!` can run commands that access keys belonging to different cluster hash slots, but ones with `#!` inherit the default flags, so they cannot.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to [Script flags]() to learn about the various scripts and the defaults.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5281,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\":

Whenever a client\\\\\\\\nruns a new command that adds more data to the cache, Redis checks the memory usage.\\\\\\\\nIf it is greater than the limit, Redis evicts keys according to the chosen\\\\\\\\neviction policy until the total memory used is back below the limit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that when a command adds a lot of data to the cache (for example, a big set\\\\\\\\nintersection stored into a new key), this might temporarily exceed the limit by\\\\\\\\na large amount.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sections below explain how to [configure the memory limit](#maxmem) for the cache\\\\\\\\nand also describe the available [eviction policies](#eviction-policies) and when to\\\\\\\\nuse them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `maxmemory` configuration directive specifies\\\\\\\\nthe maximum amount of memory to use for the cache data. You can\\\\\\\\nset `maxmemory` with the [`redis.conf`](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.4.0/redis.conf)\\\\\\\\nfile at startup time. For example, to configure a memory limit of 100 megabytes,\\\\\\\\nyou can use the following directive inside `redis.conf`:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nmaxmemory 100mb\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can also use [`CONFIG SET`]() to\\\\\\\\nset `maxmemory` at runtime using [`redis-cli`]():\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```bash\\\\\\\\n> CONFIG SET maxmemory 100mb\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSet `maxmemory` to zero to specify that you don\\'t want to limit the memory\\\\\\\\nfor the dataset.

If your database uses replication\\\\\\\\n    then this condition only applies to the primary database. Note that commands that only\\\\\\\\n    read existing data still work as normal.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-lru`: Evict the [least recently used](#apx-lru) (LRU) keys.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-lrm`: Evict the [least recently modified](#lrm-eviction) (LRM) keys.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-lfu`: Evict the [least frequently used](#lfu-eviction) (LFU) keys.\\\\\\\\n-   `allkeys-random`: Evict keys at random.\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-lru`: Evict the least recently used keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-lrm`: Evict the least recently modified keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-lfu`: Evict the least frequently used keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-random`: Evicts random keys that have an associated expiration (TTL).\\\\\\\\n-   `volatile-ttl`: Evict keys with an associated expiration (TTL) that have the shortest remaining TTL value.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `volatile-xxx` policies behave like `noeviction` if no keys have an associated expiration.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou should choose an eviction policy that fits the way your app\\\\\\\\naccesses keys. You may be able to predict the access pattern in advance\\\\\\\\nbut you can also use information from the `INFO` command at runtime to\\\\\\\\ncheck or improve your choice of policy (see\\\\\\\\n[Using the `INFO` command](#using-the-info-command) below for more information).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs a rule of thumb:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-lru` when you expect that a subset of elements will be accessed far\\\\\\\\n    more often than the rest. This is a very common case according to the\\\\\\\\n    [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), so\\\\\\\\n    `allkeys-lru` is a good default option if you have no reason to prefer any others.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-lrm` when you want to preserve frequently read data but evict data\\\\\\\\n    that hasn\\'t been modified recently. This is useful for read-heavy workloads where\\\\\\\\n    you want to distinguish between data that\\'s actively being updated versus data\\\\\\\\n    that\\'s only being read.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `allkeys-random` when you expect all keys to be accessed with roughly equal\\\\\\\\n    frequency. An example of this is when your app reads data items in a repeating cycle.\\\\\\\\n-   Use `volatile-ttl` if your code can estimate which keys are good candidates for eviction\\\\\\\\n    and assign short TTLs to them. Note also that if you make good use of\\\\\\\\n    key expiration, then you are less likely to run into the cache memory limit because keys\\\\\\\\n    will often expire before they need to be evicted.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `volatile-lru`, `volatile-lrm`, and `volatile-random` policies are mainly useful when you want to use\\\\\\\\na single Redis instance for both caching and for a set of persistent keys. However,\\\\\\\\nyou should consider running two separate Redis instances in a case like this, if possible.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that setting an `expire` value for a key costs memory, so a\\\\\\\\npolicy like `allkeys-lru` is more memory efficient since it doesn\\'t need an\\\\\\\\n`expire` value to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.283,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a52aee63-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Key eviction\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"LRM eviction {#lrm-eviction}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with Redis 8.6, the Least Recently Modified (LRM) eviction policy is available.

Use `INFO memory` to check `mem_not_counted_for_evict`.\n\n## Available Eviction Policies\n\nConfigure with `maxmemory-policy`:\n\n**Evict any key:**\n- `allkeys-lru`: Evict least recently used keys (good default)\n- `allkeys-lrm`: Evict least recently modified keys (Redis 8.6+, good for read-heavy workloads)\n- `allkeys-lfu`: Evict least frequently used keys\n- `allkeys-random`: Random eviction\n\n**Evict only keys with TTL:**\n- `volatile-lru`, `volatile-lrm`, `volatile-lfu`, `volatile-random`, `volatile-ttl`\n\n**No eviction:**\n- `noeviction`: Return errors on new writes (keys won't be evicted)\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\n```bash\n# Check current policy\nCONFIG GET maxmemory-policy\n\n# Set to allkeys-lru (most common choice)\nCONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru\n```\n\nIf you're using replication/persistence, leave some headroom:\n```bash\n# Check buffer memory\nINFO memory  # Look for mem_not_counted_for_evict\n\n# Adjust maxmemory accordingly (e.g., 10-20% below total RAM)\nCONFIG SET maxmemory 800mb  # if you have 1GB total\n```\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/eviction/index.md > Key eviction]", "session_id": "0624f107-9fd3-4803-b71f-929e004a568c", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 96566, "total_cost_usd": 0.0551795, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1280, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2562, "cache_read_input_tokens": 32034, "output_tokens": 670, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

292.8503272533417, "cost_usd": 0.1269225, "num_turns": 7, "answer_length": 2071, "answer": "完美！找到了关键信息。根据检索结果，我可以回答你的问题了。\n\n---\n\n## `failover-abort-no-good-slave` 排查方法\n\n这个错误表示 Sentinel 在尝试 failover 时，**找不到符合条件的 replica 来提升为新 master**。\n\n### 排查步骤\n\n#### 1. 检查 replica 与 master 的断连时间\n\nSentinel 会跳过与 master 断连时间过长的 replica。判断标准：\n\n```\n断连时间 > (down-after-milliseconds × 10) + master 进入 SDOWN 状态的时长\n```\n\n**排查命令：**\n```bash\n# 在每个 replica 上执行\nredis-cli -h <replica-ip> INFO replication | grep master_link_down_since_seconds\n```\n\n如果 `master_link_down_since_seconds` 过大（比如超过 `down-after-milliseconds × 10`），这个 replica 会被认为数据太旧而被跳过。\n\n#### 2. 检查 replica-priority 配置\n\n如果所有 replica 的 `replica-priority` 都设置为 `0`，它们将**永远不会被选为 master**。\n\n**排查命令：**\n```bash\n# 在每个 replica 上执行\nredis-cli -h <replica-ip> CONFIG GET replica-priority\n```\n\n**修复方法：**\n```bash\n# 至少给一个 replica 设置非零 priority（默认 100）\nredis-cli -h <replica-ip> CONFIG SET replica-priority 100\n```\n\n#### 3. 检查 replica 是否处于 SDOWN 状态\n\nSentinel 不会选择处于 SDOWN（主观下线）状态的 replica。\n\n**排查命令：**\n```bash\n# 在 Sentinel 上执行\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL replicas mymaster\n```\n\n查看输出中的 `flags` 字段，如果包含 `s_down` 或 `o_down`，说明 Sentinel 认为该 replica 不可用。\n\n#### 4. 检查 replication offset\n\n即使 replica 在线，如果它的复制进度远远落后于其他 replica，也可能不被选中。\n\n**排查命令：**\n```bash\n# 在 Sentinel 上执行\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL replicas mymaster | grep -E \"name|offset\"\n```\n\n对比各个 replica 的 `slave-repl-offset`，差距过大的会被降低优先级。\n\n### 常见原因总结\n\n| 原因 | 现象 | 解决方法 |\n|------|------|----------|\n| 所有 replica priority = 0 | 配置错误 | 至少给一个 replica 设置 priority > 0 |\n| replica 断连时间过长 | 网络分区或 replica 宕机 | 修复网络或重启 replica |\n| 所有 replica 都处于 SDOWN | Sentinel 配置的 down-after-milliseconds 过短 | 调整 down-after-milliseconds 或修复 replica |\n| replication lag 过大 | replica 性能问题或网络延迟 | 优化 replica 性能或网络 |\n\n### 临时恢复方案\n\n如果需要紧急恢复服务，可以手动降低选举标准：\n\n```bash\n# 临时调整 down-after-milliseconds（谨慎使用）\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL SET mymaster down-after-milliseconds 120000\n```\n\n或者手动指定一个 replica 提升为 master：\n\n```bash\n# 手动 failover 到指定 replica\nredis-cli -h <replica-ip> REPLICAOF NO ONE\n```\n\n---\n\n**[来源:

for Redis when not using [Redis Cluster](). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel also provides other collateral tasks such as monitoring,\\\\\\\\nnotifications and acts as a configuration provider for clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the full list of Sentinel capabilities at a macroscopic level (i.e. the *big picture*):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Monitoring**. Sentinel constantly checks if your master and replica instances are working as expected.\\\\\\\\n* **Notification**. Sentinel can notify the system administrator, or other computer programs, via an API, that something is wrong with one of the monitored Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* **Automatic failover**. If a master is not working as expected, Sentinel can start a failover process where a replica is promoted to master, the other additional replicas are reconfigured to use the new master, and the applications using the Redis server are informed about the new address to use when connecting.\\\\\\\\n* **Configuration provider**. Sentinel acts as a source of authority for clients service discovery: clients connect to Sentinels in order to ask for the address of the current Redis master responsible for a given service. If a failover occurs, Sentinels will report the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Sentinel is a distributed system:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel itself is designed to run in a configuration where there are multiple Sentinel processes cooperating together. The advantage of having multiple Sentinel processes cooperating are the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Failure detection is performed when multiple Sentinels agree about the fact a given master is no longer available. This lowers the probability of false positives.\\\\\\\\n2. Sentinel works even if not all the Sentinel processes are working, making the system robust against failures. There is no fun in having a failover system which is itself a single point of failure, after all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe sum of Sentinels, Redis instances (masters and replicas) and clients\\\\\\\\nconnecting to Sentinel and Redis, are also a larger distributed system with\\\\\\\\nspecific properties. In this document concepts will be introduced gradually\\\\\\\\nstarting from basic information needed in order to understand the basic\\\\\\\\nproperties of Sentinel, to more complex information (that are optional) in\\\\\\\\norder to understand how exactly Sentinel works.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='让我搜索更具体的 Sentinel 故障排查和 slave 相关的内容：')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_e44xFn41JM2GP29TuVn8eH', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Sentinel failover abort slave replica not eligible promotion', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_z5J5pzWTqprrTkJaEp60lP', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'sentinel|failover'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_e44xFn41JM2GP29TuVn8eH', content='{\"result\":\"[]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_z5J5pzWTqprrTkJaEp60lP', content='Found 2 files\\ndocs/eval-review.md\\ndocs/runbook/redis-failover.md', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='找到了本地的 Redis failover 文档！让我读取它：')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_ydeOTRqCWekSiOvdbSAfTL', name='Read', input={'file_path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs/runbook/redis-failover.md'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_ydeOTRqCWekSiOvdbSAfTL', content=\"     1→---\\n     2→id: redis-failover-001\\n     3→title: Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\n     4→owner: sre-team\\n     5→tags: [redis, failover, runbook, 高可用]\\n     6→created: 2025-02-13\\n     7→last_reviewed: 2025-02-13\\n     8→confidence: high\\n     9→---\\n    10→\\n    11→# Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\n    12→\\n    13→## 概述\\n    14→\\n    15→当 Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换（failover）后，应用层需要正确处理连接重建。本文档描述完整的故障恢复流程。\\n    16→\\n    17→## 故障现象\\n    18→\\n    19→- 应用日志出现大量 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\\n    20→- Sentinel 日志显示 `+switch-master` 事件\\n    21→- 监控告警：Redis 写入延迟突增\\n    22→\\n    23→## 排查步骤\\n    24→\\n    25→### 1. 确认 Sentinel 状态\\n    26→\\n    27→```bash\\n    28→redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters\\n    29→redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n    30→```\\n    31→\\n    32→确认新 master 的 IP 和端口。\\n    33→\\n    34→### 2. 检查新 master 状态\\n    35→\\n    36→```bash\\n    37→redis-cli -h <new-master-ip> -p 6379 INFO replication\\n    38→```\\n    39→\\n    40→确认 `role:master`，检查 `connected_slaves` 数量。\\n    41→\\n    42→### 3. 检查应用连接池\\n    43→\\n    44→确认应用是否已经切换到新 master：\\n    45→\\n    46→```bash\\n    47→# 查看应用连接数\\n    48→redis-cli -h <new-master-ip> CLIENT LIST | wc -l\\n    49→```\\n    50→\\n    51→## 恢复操作\\n    52→\\n    53→### 自动恢复（推荐）\\n    54→\\n    55→如果应用使用 Sentinel 客户端（如 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel），连接会自动切换。检查：\\n    56→\\n    57→1. 确认客户端配置了 Sentinel 地址而非直连 master\\n    58→2. 确认连接池的 `testOnBorrow` 或等效配置已开启\\n    59→3. 等待 30 秒，观察错误率是否下降\\n    60→\\n    61→### 手动恢复\\n    62→\\n    63→如果应用直连 master IP：\\n    64→\\n    65→1. 获取新 master 地址：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\\n    66→2. 更新应用配置中的 Redis 地址\\n    67→3. 滚动重启应用 Pod\\n    68→\\n    69→```bash\\n    70→kubectl rollout restart deployment/<app-name> -n <namespace>\\n    71→```\\n    72→\\n    73→## 预防措施\\n    74→\\n    75→- 所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\\n    76→- 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\\n    77→- 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\\n    78→\\n    79→## 相关文档\\n    80→\\n    81→- Redis Sentinel 架构设计\\n    82→- 应用连接池配置规范\\n    83→\\n\\n<system-reminder>\\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

To trigger a failover, the\\\\\\\\nODOWN state must be reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo switch from SDOWN to ODOWN no strong consensus algorithm is used, but\\\\\\\\njust a form of gossip: if a given Sentinel gets reports that a master\\\\\\\\nis not working from enough Sentinels **in a given time range**, the SDOWN is\\\\\\\\npromoted to ODOWN. If this acknowledge is later missing, the flag is cleared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA more strict authorization that uses an actual majority is required in\\\\\\\\norder to really start the failover, but no failover can be triggered without\\\\\\\\nreaching the ODOWN state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ODOWN condition **only applies to masters**. For other kind of instances\\\\\\\\nSentinel doesn\\'t require to act, so the ODOWN state is never reached for replicas\\\\\\\\nand other sentinels, but only SDOWN is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever SDOWN has also semantic implications. For example a replica in SDOWN\\\\\\\\nstate is not selected to be promoted by a Sentinel performing a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels and replicas auto discovery\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels stay connected with other Sentinels in order to reciprocally\\\\\\\\ncheck the availability of each other, and to exchange messages. However you\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t need to configure a list of other Sentinel addresses in every Sentinel\\\\\\\\ninstance you run, as Sentinel uses the Redis instances Pub/Sub capabilities\\\\\\\\nin order to discover the other Sentinels that are monitoring the same masters\\\\\\\\nand replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is implemented by sending *hello messages* into the channel named\\\\\\\\n`__sentinel__:hello`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly you don\\'t need to configure what is the list of the replicas attached\\\\\\\\nto a master, as Sentinel will auto discover this list querying Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel publishes a message to every monitored master and replica Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello`, every two seconds, announcing its presence with ip, port, runid.\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel is subscribed to the Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello` of every master and replica, looking for unknown sentinels. When new sentinels are detected, they are added as sentinels of this master.\\\\\\\\n* Hello messages also include the full current configuration of the master. If the receiving Sentinel has a configuration for a given master which is older than the one received, it updates to the new configuration immediately.\\\\\\\\n* Before adding a new sentinel to a master a Sentinel always checks if there is already a sentinel with the same runid or the same address (ip and port pair). In that case all the matching sentinels are removed, and the new added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel reconfiguration of instances outside the failover procedure\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven when no failover is in progress, Sentinels will always try to set the\\\\\\\\ncurrent configuration on monitored instances. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Replicas (according to the current configuration) that claim to be masters, will be configured as replicas to replicate with the current master.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas connected to a wrong master, will be reconfigured to replicate with the right master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinels to reconfigure replicas, the wrong configuration must be observed for some time, that is greater than the period used to broadcast new configurations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis prevents Sentinels with a stale configuration (for example because they just rejoined from a partition) will try to change the replicas configuration before receiving an update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note how the semantics of always trying to impose the current configuration makes the failover more resistant to partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Masters failed over are reconfigured as replicas when they return available.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas partitioned away during a partition are reconfigured once reachable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe important lesson to remember about this section is: **Sentinel is a system where each process will always try to impose the last logical configuration to the set of monitored instances**.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.1249,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-023\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"More advanced concepts > Replica selection and priority\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"When a Sentinel instance is ready to perform a failover, since the master\\\\\\\\nis in `ODOWN` state and the Sentinel received the authorization to failover\\\\\\\\nfrom the majority of the Sentinel instances known, a suitable replica needs\\\\\\\\nto be selected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe replica selection process evaluates the following information about replicas:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

If there is a particular fail-over\\\\\\\\npreference, `replica-priority` must be set on all instances, including masters,\\\\\\\\nas a master may become a replica at some future point in time - and it will then\\\\\\\\nneed the proper `replica-priority` settings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis instance can be configured with a special `replica-priority` of zero\\\\\\\\nin order to be **never selected** by Sentinels as the new master.\\\\\\\\nHowever a replica configured in this way will still be reconfigured by\\\\\\\\nSentinels in order to replicate with the new master after a failover, the\\\\\\\\nonly difference is that it will never become a master itself.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4768,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel quick start > Example Sentinel deployments\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The other options are almost always in the form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel <option_name> <master_name> <option_value>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd are used for the following purposes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* `down-after-milliseconds` is the time in milliseconds an instance should not\\\\\\\\nbe reachable (either does not reply to our PINGs or it is replying with an\\\\\\\\nerror) for a Sentinel starting to think it is down.\\\\\\\\n* `parallel-syncs` sets the number of replicas that can be reconfigured to use\\\\\\\\nthe new master after a failover at the same time.

There is no\\\\\\\\nneed to specify replicas, which are auto-discovered. Sentinel will update the\\\\\\\\nconfiguration automatically with additional information about replicas (in\\\\\\\\norder to retain the information in case of restart). The configuration is\\\\\\\\nalso rewritten every time a replica is promoted to master during a failover\\\\\\\\nand every time a new Sentinel is discovered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe example configuration above basically monitors two sets of Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances, each composed of a master and an undefined number of replicas.\\\\\\\\nOne set of instances is called `mymaster`, and the other `resque`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe meaning of the arguments of `sentinel monitor` statements is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <port> <quorum>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the sake of clarity, let\\'s check line by line what the configuration\\\\\\\\noptions mean:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first line is used to tell Redis to monitor a master called *mymaster*,\\\\\\\\nthat is at address 127.0.0.1 and port 6379, with a quorum of 2. Everything\\\\\\\\nis pretty obvious but the **quorum** argument:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The **quorum** is the number of Sentinels that need to agree about the fact the master is not reachable, in order to really mark the master as failing, and eventually start a failover procedure if possible.\\\\\\\\n* However **the quorum is only used to detect the failure**. In order to actually perform a failover, one of the Sentinels need to be elected leader for the failover and be authorized to proceed. This only happens with the vote of the **majority of the Sentinel processes**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo for example if you have 5 Sentinel processes, and the quorum for a given\\\\\\\\nmaster set to the value of 2, this is what happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If two Sentinels agree at the same time about the master being unreachable, one of the two will try to start a failover.\\\\\\\\n* If there are at least a total of three Sentinels reachable, the failover will be authorized and will actually start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn practical terms this means during failures **Sentinel never starts a failover if the majority of Sentinel processes are unable to talk** (aka no failover in the minority partition).\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content":

SORT with multiple keys has similar restrictions when clustering is enabled.\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. Use Hash Tags to Force Same Slot\n\nWrap the common part of your key names in curly braces `{}`:\n\n```redis\n# Instead of:\nSUNION user:1:tags user:2:tags user:3:tags  # ❌ CROSSSLOT error\n\n# Use hash tags:\nSUNION {users}:1:tags {users}:2:tags {users}:3:tags  # ✅ Same slot\n```\n\nThe cluster only hashes the part inside `{}`, ensuring all keys land in the same slot.\n\n### 2. Redesign Your Data Model\n\nIf hash tags aren't feasible, consider:\n- **Denormalize data** to avoid cross-key operations\n- **Use a single key** with Redis data structures (e.g., a single sorted set instead of multiple sets)\n- **Perform union operations client-side** by fetching individual sets and merging in your application\n\n### 3. Check Your Redis Configuration\n\nThe behavior depends on your setup:\n\n- **Redis OSS Cluster** (OSS cluster API enabled): SUNION is **single-slot only**\n- **Redis Software** (OSS cluster API disabled): SUNION is still **single-slot only**\n- **Single instance** (no clustering): SUNION works across any keys\n\n### 4. Alternative Approaches\n\nFor SORT specifically:\n- Use `SORT key BY nosort` to avoid external key lookups\n- Store sortable data within the key itself\n- Perform sorting client-side after retrieval\n\n## Quick Check\n\nVerify which slots your keys are in:\n\n```redis\nCLUSTER KEYSLOT user:1:tags\nCLUSTER KEYSLOT user:2:tags\nCLUSTER KEYSLOT {users}:1:tags  # Should return same slot for all {users}:* keys\n```\n\n[来源: tests/fixtures/kb-sources/redis-docs/content/develop/using-commands/multi-key-operations.md > Troubleshooting Multi-Key Operations, Examples by Configuration]",

Here's what's happening and how to fix it:\n\n## Root Cause\n\nDuring AOF rewrite, Redis forks a child process that writes to a **temporary file**. The error occurs when:\n\n1. The Redis process lacks write permissions in the AOF directory\n2. The temporary file path is inaccessible\n3. File descriptor limits are exhausted\n4. SELinux/AppArmor is blocking file creation\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n**1. Check directory permissions:**\n```bash\nls -ld /path/to/redis/data\nls -l /path/to/redis/data/appendonlydir/\n```\nEnsure the Redis user (often `redis`) has write access.\n\n**2. Verify Redis is running as the correct user:**\n```bash\nps aux | grep redis-server\n```\n\n**3. Check file descriptor limits:**\n```bash\ncat /proc/$(pidof redis-server)/limits | grep \"open files\"\n```\n\n**4. Review Redis logs for the exact error:**\n```bash\ngrep -i \"can't open\" /var/log/redis/redis-server.log\n```\n\n## Solutions\n\n**Fix permissions:**\n```bash\nchown -R redis:redis /var/lib/redis\nchmod 750 /var/lib/redis\n```\n\n**Increase file descriptor limits** (in `/etc/security/limits.conf`):\n```\nredis soft nofile 10032\nredis hard nofile 10032\n```\n\n**Check SELinux context** (if applicable):\n```bash\nls -Z /var/lib/redis\nrestorecon -Rv /var/lib/redis\n```\n\n## How AOF Rewrite Works\n\nAccording to the Redis persistence mechanism:\n\n- Redis forks a child process\n- Child writes the new base AOF to a **temporary file**\n- Parent continues writing to an incremental AOF file\n- When complete, Redis atomically swaps files via manifest update\n\nIf the child can't create the temporary file due to permissions, the rewrite fails but your data remains safe (old AOF files are preserved).\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md > Append-only file > How it works]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["AOF", "rewrite", "append"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/signals.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "bf8a3096-c06d-45d1-9cfc-2842ce1f802f", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "75908638-8088-48ea-8187-457d15ddfbd6", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='I\\'ll search for information about Redis AOF rewrite failures with the \"Can\\'t open the append-only file\" error.')]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_m1Ztp266dvYpAabv6PS8Tw', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': \"Can't open the append-only file|AOF rewrite|appendonly\"})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_NnDgc9cFsuU3gH3UYx8nZQ', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': \"Redis AOF rewrite failing can't open append-only file permission error\", 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_m1Ztp266dvYpAabv6PS8Tw', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_NnDgc9cFsuU3gH3UYx8nZQ', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.8572,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"34eb29ec-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/persistence.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis persistence\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Append-only file > How it works\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Log rewriting uses the same copy-on-write trick already in use for\\\\\\\\nsnapshotting.

Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI\\'ve little time, give me the checklist\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following documentation is very important in order to run Redis in\\\\\\\\na low latency fashion. However I understand that we are busy people, so\\\\\\\\nlet\\'s start with a quick checklist. If you fail following these steps, please\\\\\\\\nreturn here to read the full documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Make sure you are not running slow commands that are blocking the server. Use the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog) to check this.\\\\\\\\n2. For EC2 users, make sure you use HVM based modern EC2 instances, like m3.medium. Otherwise fork() is too slow.\\\\\\\\n3. Transparent huge pages must be disabled from your kernel. Use `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled` to disable them, and restart your Redis process.\\\\\\\\n4. If you are using a virtual machine, it is possible that you have an intrinsic latency that has nothing to do with Redis. Check the minimum latency you can expect from your runtime environment using `./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100`. Note: you need to run this command in *the server* not in the client.\\\\\\\\n5. Enable and use the [Latency monitor]() feature of Redis in order to get a human readable description of the latency events and causes in your Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general, use the following table for durability VS latency/performance tradeoffs, ordered from stronger safety to better latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. AOF + fsync always: this is very slow, you should use it only if you know what you are doing.\\\\\\\\n2. AOF + fsync every second: this is a good compromise.\\\\\\\\n3. AOF + fsync every second + no-appendfsync-on-rewrite option set to yes: this is as the above, but avoids to fsync during rewrites to lower the disk pressure.\\\\\\\\n4. AOF + fsync never. Fsyncing is up to the kernel in this setup, even less disk pressure and risk of latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n5. RDB. Here you have a vast spectrum of tradeoffs depending on the save triggers you configure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd now for people with 15 minutes to spend, the details...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeasuring latency\\\\\\\\n-----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you are experiencing latency problems, you probably know how to measure\\\\\\\\nit in the context of your application, or maybe your latency problem is very\\\\\\\\nevident even macroscopically. However redis-cli can be used to measure the\\\\\\\\nlatency of a Redis server in milliseconds, just try:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    redis-cli --latency -h `host` -p `port`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing the internal Redis latency monitoring subsystem\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis 2.8.13, Redis provides latency monitoring capabilities that\\\\\\\\nare able to sample different execution paths to understand where the\\\\\\\\nserver is blocking. This makes debugging of the problems illustrated in\\\\\\\\nthis documentation much simpler, so we suggest enabling latency monitoring\\\\\\\\nASAP. Please refer to the [Latency monitor documentation]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the latency monitoring sampling and reporting capabilities will make\\\\\\\\nit simpler to understand the source of latency in your Redis system, it is still\\\\\\\\nadvised that you read this documentation extensively to better understand\\\\\\\\nthe topic of Redis and latency spikes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency baseline\\\\\\\\n----------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is a kind of latency that is inherently part of the environment where\\\\\\\\nyou run Redis, that is the latency provided by your operating system kernel\\\\\\\\nand, if you are using virtualization, by the hypervisor you are using.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile this latency can\\'t be removed it is important to study it because\\\\\\\\nit is the baseline, or in other words, you won\\'t be able to achieve a Redis\\\\\\\\nlatency that is better than the latency that every process running in your\\\\\\\\nenvironment will experience because of the kernel or hypervisor implementation\\\\\\\\nor setup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe call this kind of latency **intrinsic latency**, and `redis-cli` starting\\\\\\\\nfrom Redis version 2.8.7 is able to measure it. This is an example run\\\\\\\\nunder Linux 3.11.0 running on an entry level server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: the argument `100` is the number of seconds the test will be executed.\\\\\\\\nThe more time we run the test, the more likely we\\'ll be able to spot\\\\\\\\nlatency spikes. 100 seconds is usually appropriate, however you may want\\\\\\\\nto perform a few runs at different times. Please note that the test is CPU\\\\\\\\nintensive and will likely saturate a single core in your system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 16 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 50 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 53 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 83 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 115 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: redis-cli in this special case needs to **run in the server** where you run or plan to run Redis, not in the client. In this special mode redis-cli does not connect to a Redis server at all: it will just try to measure the largest time the kernel does not provide CPU time to run to the redis-cli process itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above example, the intrinsic latency of the system is just 0.115\\\\\\\\nmilliseconds (or 115 microseconds), which is a good news, however keep in mind\\\\\\\\nthat the intrinsic latency may change over time depending on the load of the\\\\\\\\nsystem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nVirtualized environments will not show so good numbers, especially with high\\\\\\\\nload or if there are noisy neighbors. The following is a run on a Linode 4096\\\\\\\\ninstance running Redis and Apache:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ ./redis-cli --intrinsic-latency 100\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 573 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 695 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 919 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 1606 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 3191 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9243 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n    Max latency so far: 9671 microseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere we have an intrinsic latency of 9.7 milliseconds: this means that we can\\'t ask better than that to Redis. However other runs at different times in different virtualization environments with higher load or with noisy neighbors can easily show even worse values. We were able to measure up to 40 milliseconds in\\\\\\\\nsystems otherwise apparently running normally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by network and communication\\\\\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.\\\\\\\\nThe typical latency of a 1 Gbit/s network is about 200 us, while the latency\\\\\\\\nwith a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your\\\\\\\\nnetwork and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system\\\\\\\\nadds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,\\\\\\\\netc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironment than on a physical machine.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond\\\\\\\\nrange, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay\\\\\\\\nfor these network and system related latencies.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by\\\\\\\\npipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers\\\\\\\\nand most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for\\\\\\\\nthat purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support\\\\\\\\nvariadic parameters for all data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere are some guidelines:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.\\\\\\\\n+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true\\\\\\\\n  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.\\\\\\\\n+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic\\\\\\\\n  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.\\\\\\\\n+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis supports Lua server-side scripting to cover cases that are not suitable\\\\\\\\n  for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is an input for\\\\\\\\n  the following commands).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOn Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process\\\\\\\\nplacement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA\\\\\\\\nconfiguration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note\\\\\\\\nvanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.\\\\\\\\nRedis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming\\\\\\\\nlike [`BGSAVE`](/commands/bgsave) or [`BGREWRITEAOF`](/commands/bgrewriteaof). These tasks must **never** run on the same core\\\\\\\\nas the main event loop.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.\\\\\\\\nOnly do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSingle threaded nature of Redis\\\\\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process\\\\\\\\nserves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.\\\\\\\\nThis means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so\\\\\\\\nall the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how Node.js\\\\\\\\nworks as well. However, both products are not often perceived as being slow.\\\\\\\\nThis is caused in part by the small amount of time to complete a single request,\\\\\\\\nbut primarily because these products are designed to not block on system calls,\\\\\\\\nsuch as reading data from or writing data to a socket.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4\\\\\\\\nwe use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the\\\\\\\\nbackground, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact\\\\\\\\nthat Redis serves all the requests using a single thread.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by slow commands\\\\\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve\\\\\\\\nall the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing\\\\\\\\nnormal commands, like [`GET`](/commands/get) or [`SET`](/commands/set) or [`LPUSH`](/commands/lpush) this is not a problem\\\\\\\\nat all since these commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.\\\\\\\\nHowever there are commands operating on many elements, like [`SORT`](/commands/sort), [`LREM`](/commands/lrem),\\\\\\\\n[`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets\\\\\\\\ncan take a considerable amount of time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice\\\\\\\\nis to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against\\\\\\\\nvalues composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis\\\\\\\\nreplication where you run all your slow queries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis\\\\\\\\n[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program\\\\\\\\n(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the\\\\\\\\nmain Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually\\\\\\\\na sign that slow commands are used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: a VERY common source of latency generated by the execution\\\\\\\\nof slow commands is the use of the [`KEYS`](/commands/keys) command in production environments.\\\\\\\\n[`KEYS`](/commands/keys), as documented in the Redis documentation, should only be used for\\\\\\\\ndebugging purposes. Since Redis 2.8 a new commands were introduced in order to\\\\\\\\niterate the key space and other large collections incrementally, please check\\\\\\\\nthe [`SCAN`](/commands/scan), [`SSCAN`](/commands/sscan), [`HSCAN`](/commands/hscan) and [`ZSCAN`](/commands/zscan) commands for more information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by fork\\\\\\\\n-------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to generate the RDB file in background, or to rewrite the Append Only File if AOF persistence is enabled, Redis has to fork background processes.\\\\\\\\nThe fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency by itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nForking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves\\\\\\\\ncopying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially\\\\\\\\ntrue for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 kB pages.\\\\\\\\nTo convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores\\\\\\\\na page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer\\\\\\\\nper page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance\\\\\\\\nrequires a page table of 24 GB / 4 kB * 8 = 48 MB.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,\\\\\\\\nwhich will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time\\\\\\\\nand CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization\\\\\\\\nof a large memory chunk can be expensive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFork time in different systems\\\\\\\\n------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nModern hardware is pretty fast at copying the page table, but Xen is not.\\\\\\\\nThe problem with Xen is not virtualization-specific, but Xen-specific. For instance using VMware or Virtual Box does not result into slow fork time.\\\\\\\\nThe following is a table that compares fork time for different Redis instance\\\\\\\\nsize. Data is obtained performing a BGSAVE and looking at the `latest_fork_usec` filed in the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the good news is that **new types of EC2 HVM based instances are much\\\\\\\\nbetter with fork times**, almost on par with physical servers, so for example\\\\\\\\nusing m3.medium (or better) instances will provide good results.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Linux beefy VM on VMware** 6.0GB RSS forked in 77 milliseconds (12.8 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Unknown HW)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 80 milliseconds (13.1 milliseconds per GB)\\\\\\\\n* **Linux running on physical machine (Xeon @ 2.27Ghz)** 6.9GB RSS forked into 62 milliseconds (9 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on 6sync (KVM)** 360 MB RSS forked in 8.2 milliseconds (23.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, old instance types (Xen)** 6.1GB RSS forked in 1460 milliseconds (239.3 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on EC2, new instance types (Xen)** 1GB RSS forked in 10 milliseconds (10 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n* **Linux VM on Linode (Xen)** 0.9GBRSS forked into 382 milliseconds (424 milliseconds per GB).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see certain VMs running on Xen have a performance hit that is between one order to two orders of magnitude. For EC2 users the suggestion is simple: use modern HVM based instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by transparent huge pages\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately when a Linux kernel has transparent huge pages enabled, Redis\\\\\\\\nincurs to a big latency penalty after the `fork` call is used in order to\\\\\\\\npersist on disk. Huge pages are the cause of the following issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Fork is called, two processes with shared huge pages are created.\\\\\\\\n2. In a busy instance, a few event loops runs will cause commands to target a few thousand of pages, causing the copy on write of almost the whole process memory.\\\\\\\\n3. This will result in big latency and big memory usage.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMake sure to **disable transparent huge pages** using the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency induced by swapping (operating system paging)\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLinux (and many other modern operating systems) is able to relocate memory\\\\\\\\npages from the memory to the disk, and vice versa, in order to use the\\\\\\\\nsystem memory efficiently.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf a Redis page is moved by the kernel from the memory to the swap file, when\\\\\\\\nthe data stored in this memory page is used by Redis (for example accessing\\\\\\\\na key stored into this memory page) the kernel will stop the Redis process\\\\\\\\nin order to move the page back into the main memory. This is a slow operation\\\\\\\\ninvolving random I/Os (compared to accessing a page that is already in memory)\\\\\\\\nand will result into anomalous latency experienced by Redis clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe kernel relocates Redis memory pages on disk mainly because of three reasons:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The system is under memory pressure since the running processes are demanding\\\\\\\\nmore physical memory than the amount that is available. The simplest instance of\\\\\\\\nthis problem is simply Redis using more memory than is available.\\\\\\\\n* The Redis instance data set, or part of the data set, is mostly completely idle\\\\\\\\n(never accessed by clients), so the kernel could swap idle memory pages on disk.\\\\\\\\nThis problem is very rare since even a moderately slow instance will touch all\\\\\\\\nthe memory pages often, forcing the kernel to retain all the pages in memory.\\\\\\\\n* Some processes are generating massive read or write I/Os on the system. Because\\\\\\\\nfiles are generally cached, it tends to put pressure on the kernel to increase\\\\\\\\nthe filesystem cache, and therefore generate swapping activity. Please note it\\\\\\\\nincludes Redis RDB and/or AOF background threads which can produce large files.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFortunately Linux offers good tools to investigate the problem, so the simplest\\\\\\\\nthing to do is when latency due to swapping is suspected is just to check if\\\\\\\\nthis is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first thing to do is to checking the amount of Redis memory that is swapped\\\\\\\\non disk. In order to do so you need to obtain the Redis instance pid:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli info | grep process_id\\\\\\\\n    process_id:5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow enter the /proc file system directory for this process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cd /proc/5454\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere you\\'ll find a file called **smaps** that describes the memory layout of\\\\\\\\nthe Redis process (assuming you are using Linux 2.6.16 or newer).\\\\\\\\nThis file contains very detailed information about our process memory maps,\\\\\\\\nand one field called **Swap** is exactly what we are looking for. However\\\\\\\\nthere is not just a single swap field since the smaps file contains the\\\\\\\\ndifferent memory maps of our Redis process (The memory layout of a process\\\\\\\\nis more complex than a simple linear array of pages).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince we are interested in all the memory swapped by our process the first thing\\\\\\\\nto do is to grep for the Swap field across all the file:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | grep \\'Swap:\\'\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf everything is 0 kB, or if there are sporadic 4k entries, everything is\\\\\\\\nperfectly normal. Actually in our example instance (the one of a real web\\\\\\\\nsite running Redis and serving hundreds of users every second) there are a\\\\\\\\nfew entries that show more swapped pages. To investigate if this is a serious\\\\\\\\nproblem or not we change our command in order to also print the size of the\\\\\\\\nmemory map:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ cat smaps | egrep \\'^(Swap|Size)\\'\\\\\\\\n    Size:                316 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 40 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                132 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:             720896 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               4096 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                156 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               4096 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               4096 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:               1272 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 16 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 84 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  8 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                144 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                 12 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                108 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                272 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n    Size:                  4 kB\\\\\\\\n    Swap:                  0 kB\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see from the output, there is a map of 720896 kB\\\\\\\\n(with just 12 kB swapped) and 156 kB more swapped in another map:\\\\\\\\nbasically a very small amount of our memory is swapped so this is not\\\\\\\\ngoing to create any problem at all.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf instead a non trivial amount of the process memory is swapped on disk your\\\\\\\\nlatency problems are likely related to swapping.

One is\\\\\\\\nwrite(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and\\\\\\\\nthe other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel\\\\\\\\nfile buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by\\\\\\\\nthe user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBoth the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.\\\\\\\\nFor instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync\\\\\\\\nin progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires\\\\\\\\nto flush on disk in order to accept new writes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations\\\\\\\\nof kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to\\\\\\\\na few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process\\\\\\\\ndoing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call\\\\\\\\nin a different thread since Redis 2.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency\\\\\\\\nwhen using the AOF file.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe AOF can be configured to perform a fsync on disk in three different\\\\\\\\nways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be\\\\\\\\nmodified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.\\\\\\\\nIn this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).\\\\\\\\nWhen this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can\\'t\\\\\\\\ncope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is\\\\\\\\nuncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing\\\\\\\\nI/O.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs a\\\\\\\\nfsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still\\\\\\\\nin progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds\\\\\\\\n(since write would block on Linux if a fsync is in progress against the\\\\\\\\nsame file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually\\\\\\\\nperform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this\\\\\\\\ncan be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** a fsync is performed\\\\\\\\nat every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code\\\\\\\\n(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time\\\\\\\\ninto a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and\\\\\\\\nit is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation\\\\\\\\nthat can perform the fsync in short time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is\\\\\\\\nto avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.\\\\\\\\nUsing an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform\\\\\\\\nwell with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes\\\\\\\\nto the append only file without performing any seek.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only\\\\\\\\nfile you can use the strace command under Linux:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by\\\\\\\\nRedis in the main thread. With the above command you\\'ll not see the\\\\\\\\nfdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the\\\\\\\\nappendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so\\\\\\\\njust add the -f switch to strace.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the\\\\\\\\nfollowing command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client\\\\\\\\nsockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.\\\\\\\\nApparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so\\\\\\\\nI use the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v \\'0.0\\' | grep -v unfinished\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLatency generated by expires\\\\\\\\n----------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis evict expired keys in two ways:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ One *lazy* way expires a key when it is requested by a command, but it is found to be already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ One *active* way expires a few keys every 100 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe active expiring is designed to be adaptive. An expire cycle is started every 100 milliseconds (10 times per second), and will do the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Sample `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` keys, evicting all the keys already expired.\\\\\\\\n+ If the more than 25% of the keys were found expired, repeat.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that `ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_LOOKUPS_PER_LOOP` is set to 20 by default, and the process is performed ten times per second, usually just 200 keys per second are actively expired. This is enough to clean the DB fast enough even when already expired keys are not accessed for a long time, so that the *lazy* algorithm does not help. At the same time expiring just 200 keys per second has no effects in the latency a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever the algorithm is adaptive and will loop if it finds more than 25% of keys already expired in the set of sampled keys. But given that we run the algorithm ten times per second, this means that the unlucky event of more than 25% of the keys in our random sample are expiring at least *in the same second*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically this means that **if the database has many, many keys expiring in the same second, and these make up at least 25% of the current population of keys with an expire set**, Redis can block in order to get the percentage of keys already expired below 25%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach is needed in order to avoid using too much memory for keys that are already expired, and usually is absolutely harmless since it\\'s strange that a big number of keys are going to expire in the same exact second, but it is not impossible that the user used [`EXPIREAT`](/commands/expireat) extensively with the same Unix time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short: be aware that many keys expiring at the same moment can be a source of latency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis software watchdog\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis 2.6 introduces the *Redis Software Watchdog* that is a debugging tool\\\\\\\\ndesigned to track those latency problems that for one reason or the other\\\\\\\\nescaped an analysis using normal tools.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe software watchdog is an experimental feature. While it is designed to\\\\\\\\nbe used in production environments care should be taken to backup the database\\\\\\\\nbefore proceeding as it could possibly have unexpected interactions with the\\\\\\\\nnormal execution of the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt is important to use it only as *last resort* when there is no way to track the issue by other means.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is how this feature works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The user enables the software watchdog using the [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) command.\\\\\\\\n* Redis starts monitoring itself constantly.\\\\\\\\n* If Redis detects that the server is blocked into some operation that is not returning fast enough, and that may be the source of the latency issue, a low level report about where the server is blocked is dumped on the log file.\\\\\\\\n* The user contacts the developers writing a message in the Redis Google Group, including the watchdog report in the message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that this feature cannot be enabled using the redis.conf file, because it is designed to be enabled only in already running instances and only for debugging purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo enable the feature just use the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    CONFIG SET watchdog-period 500\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe period is specified in milliseconds. In the above example I specified to log latency issues only if the server detects a delay of 500 milliseconds or greater. The minimum configurable period is 200 milliseconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you are done with the software watchdog you can turn it off setting the `watchdog-period` parameter to 0. **Important:** remember to do this because keeping the instance with the watchdog turned on for a longer time than needed is generally not a good idea.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is an example of what you\\'ll see printed in the log file once the software watchdog detects a delay longer than the configured one:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    [8547 | signal handler] (1333114359)\\\\\\\\n    --- WATCHDOG TIMER EXPIRED ---\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libpthread.so.0(+0xf8f0) [0x7f16b5f158f0]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(nanosleep+0x2d) [0x7f16b5c2d39d]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(usleep+0x34) [0x7f16b5c62844]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(debugCommand+0x3e1) [0x43ab41]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(call+0x5d) [0x415a9d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processCommand+0x375) [0x415fc5]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(processInputBuffer+0x4f) [0x4203cf]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(readQueryFromClient+0xa0) [0x4204e0]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeProcessEvents+0x128) [0x411b48]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(aeMain+0x2b) [0x411dbb]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server(main+0x2b6) [0x418556]\\\\\\\\n    /lib/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x7f16b5ba1c4d]\\\\\\\\n    ./redis-server() [0x411099]\\\\\\\\n    ------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: in the example the **DEBUG SLEEP** command was used in order to block the server.

The key advantage is that sorted sets maintain elements in order by score, which can represent timestamps.\n\n## How It Works\n\nA sliding-window rate limiter using sorted sets typically works as follows:\n\n1. **Use timestamps as scores**: Each API request is added to a sorted set with the current timestamp as the score\n2. **Member uniqueness**: Each member (request ID) is unique, preventing duplicates\n3. **Time-based queries**: You can efficiently query requests within a time window\n4. **Automatic ordering**: Elements are automatically sorted by timestamp, enabling O(log(N)) operations\n\n## Key Redis Commands for Rate Limiting\n\n- **`ZADD`**: Add a new request with timestamp as score\n  ```\n  ZADD rate_limiter:<user_id> <current_timestamp> <request_id>\n  ```\n\n- **`ZREMRANGEBYSCORE`**: Remove old requests outside the time window\n  ```\n  ZREMRANGEBYSCORE rate_limiter:<user_id> 0 <window_start_time>\n  ```\n\n- **`ZCOUNT`**: Count requests within the current window\n  ```\n  ZCOUNT rate_limiter:<user_id> <window_start_time> <current_timestamp>\n  ```\n\n## Implementation Pattern\n\n1. Remove expired entries (older than your time window)\n2. Count current requests in the window\n3. If count < limit, add the new request and allow it\n4. If count >= limit, reject the request\n\n## Performance Characteristics\n\n- **Time complexity**: O(log(N)) for adding elements via `ZADD`\n- **Already sorted**: No additional sorting needed when querying by time range\n- **Efficient cleanup**: Range-based removal of old entries is fast\n\n[Source: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md > Redis sorted sets]", "tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md"], "contexts_count": 2, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["sorted set", "score", "ZADD", "expired", "search"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "0fe7fbc7-26f4-4562-ac9f-dda16337003a", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "dc38f666-d779-4c67-8cb5-30a0e4bcaadf", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about implementing a rate limiter using Redis sorted sets.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_x161Xd4cHv7CeP7Lu95loN', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': '/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search/docs', 'pattern': 'rate limit'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_nbdGVrAL1TxOJhelnrGQxI', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'rate limiter Redis sorted sets implementation', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_x161Xd4cHv7CeP7Lu95loN', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_nbdGVrAL1TxOJhelnrGQxI', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.3041,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis sorted set is a collection of unique strings (members) ordered by an associated score.\\\\\\\\nWhen more than one string has the same score, the strings are ordered lexicographically.\\\\\\\\nSome use cases for sorted sets include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Leaderboards.

In particular, you can use a sorted set to build a sliding-window rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can think of sorted sets as a mix between a Set and\\\\\\\\na Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating\\\\\\\\nstring elements, so in some sense a sorted set is a set as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in\\\\\\\\na sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called *the score*\\\\\\\\n(this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element\\\\\\\\nis mapped to a value).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoreover, elements in a sorted set are *taken in order* (so they are not\\\\\\\\nordered on request, order is a peculiarity of the data structure used to\\\\\\\\nrepresent sorted sets). They are ordered according to the following rule:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If B and A are two elements with a different score, then A > B if A.score is > B.score.\\\\\\\\n* If B and A have exactly the same score, then A > B if the A string is lexicographically greater than the B string.

Since numbers in big\\\\\\\\nendian, when ordered lexicographically (in raw bytes order) are actually\\\\\\\\nordered numerically as well, you can ask for ranges in the 128 bit space,\\\\\\\\nand get the element\\'s value discarding the prefix\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdating the score: leaderboards\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust a final note about sorted sets before switching to the next topic.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets\\' scores can be updated at any time. Just calling [`ZADD`]() against\\\\\\\\nan element already included in the sorted set will update its score\\\\\\\\n(and position) with O(log(N)) time complexity.  As such, sorted sets are suitable\\\\\\\\nwhen there are tons of updates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause of this characteristic a common use case is leaderboards.\\\\\\\\nThe typical application is a Facebook game where you combine the ability to\\\\\\\\ntake users sorted by their high score, plus the get-rank operation, in order\\\\\\\\nto show the top-N users, and the user rank in the leader board (e.g., \\\\\\\\\\\\\"you are\\\\\\\\nthe #4932 best score here\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.752,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"7aa61062-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sorted-sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sorted sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Learn more\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"* There are two ways we can use a sorted set to represent a leaderboard. If we know a racer\\'s new score, we can update it directly via the [`ZADD`]() command. However, if we want to add points to an existing score, we can use the [`ZINCRBY`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 100 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wood\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 100 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> ZADD racer_scores 150 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n(integer) 0\\\\\\\\n> ZINCRBY racer_scores 50 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Wood\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"150\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> ZINCRBY racer_scores 50 \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Henshaw\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"200\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll see that [`ZADD`]() returns 0 when the member already exists (the score is updated), while [`ZINCRBY`]() returns the new score. The score for racer Henshaw went from 100, was changed to 150 with no regard for what score was there before, and then was incremented by 50 to 200.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [`ZADD`]() adds a new member and associated score to a sorted set. If the member already exists, the score is updated.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZRANGE`]() returns members of a sorted set, sorted within a given range.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZRANK`]() returns the rank of the provided member, assuming the sorted set is in ascending order.\\\\\\\\n* [`ZREVRANK`]() returns the rank of the provided member, assuming the sorted set is in descending order.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSee the [complete list of sorted set commands](?group=sorted-set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMost sorted set operations are O(log(n)), where _n_ is the number of members.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExercise some caution when running the [`ZRANGE`]() command with large returns values (e.g., in the tens of thousands or more).\\\\\\\\nThis command\\'s time complexity is O(log(n) + m), where _m_ is the number of results returned.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis sorted sets are sometimes used for indexing other Redis data structures.\\\\\\\\nIf you need to index and query your data, consider the [JSON]() data type and the [Redis Query Engine]() features.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* [Redis Sorted Sets Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUKlxdBQZ7g) is an entertaining introduction to sorted sets in Redis.\\\\\\\\n* [Redis University\\'s RU101](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru101/) explores Redis sorted sets in detail.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4312,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"43b5f91b-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/lists.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis lists\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Examples > What are Lists?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To explain the List data type it\\'s better to start with a little bit of theory,\\\\\\\\nas the term *List* is often used in an improper way by information technology\\\\\\\\nfolks. For instance \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python Lists\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not what the name may suggest (Linked\\\\\\\\nLists), but rather Arrays (the same data type is called Array in\\\\\\\\nRuby actually).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom a very general point of view a List is just a sequence of ordered\\\\\\\\nelements: 10,20,1,2,3 is a list. But the properties of a List implemented using\\\\\\\\nan Array are very different from the properties of a List implemented using a\\\\\\\\n*Linked List*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have\\\\\\\\nmillions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in\\\\\\\\nthe head or in the tail of the list is performed *in constant time*. The speed of adding a\\\\\\\\nnew element with the [`LPUSH`]() command to the head of a list with ten\\\\\\\\nelements is the same as adding an element to the head of list with 10\\\\\\\\nmillion elements.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat\\'s the downside? Accessing an element *by index* is very fast in lists\\\\\\\\nimplemented with an Array (constant time indexed access) and not so fast in\\\\\\\\nlists implemented by linked lists (where the operation requires an amount of\\\\\\\\nwork proportional to the index of the accessed element).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Lists are implemented with linked lists because for a database system it\\\\\\\\nis crucial to be able to add elements to a very long list in a very fast way.\\\\\\\\nAnother strong advantage, as you\\'ll see in a moment, is that Redis Lists can be\\\\\\\\ntaken at constant length in constant time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen fast access to the middle of a large collection of elements is important,\\\\\\\\nthere is a different data structure that can be used, called sorted sets.\\\\\\\\nSorted sets are covered in the [Sorted sets]() tutorial page.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.4041,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"2e535593-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/data-types/sets.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis sets\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Limits\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The [`SADD`]() command adds new elements to a set. It\\'s also possible\\\\\\\\nto do a number of other operations against sets like testing if a given element\\\\\\\\nalready exists, performing the intersection, union or difference between\\\\\\\\nmultiple sets, and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> SMEMBERS bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) bike:3\\\\\\\\n2) bike:1\\\\\\\\n3) bike:2\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere I\\'ve added three elements to my set and told Redis to return all the\\\\\\\\nelements. There is no order guarantee with a set. Redis is free to return the\\\\\\\\nelements in any order at every call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis has commands to test for set membership. These commands can be used on single as well as multiple items:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> SISMEMBER bikes:racing:france bike:1\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SMISMEMBER bikes:racing:france bike:2 bike:3 bike:4\\\\\\\\n1) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n2) (integer) 1\\\\\\\\n3) (integer) 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can also find the difference between two sets. For instance, we may want\\\\\\\\nto know which bikes are racing in France but not in the USA:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:usa bike:1 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are other non trivial operations that are still easy to implement\\\\\\\\nusing the right Redis commands. For instance we may want a list of all the\\\\\\\\nbikes racing in France, the USA, and some other races. We can do this using\\\\\\\\nthe [`SINTER`]() command, which performs the intersection between different\\\\\\\\nsets. In addition to intersection you can also perform\\\\\\\\nunions, difference, and more. For example \\\\\\\\nif we add a third race we can see some of these commands in action:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3\\\\\\\\n(integer) 3\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:usa bike:1 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 2\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:italy bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4\\\\\\\\n(integer) 4\\\\\\\\n> SINTER bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SUNION bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:italy\\\\\\\\n(empty array)\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:france bikes:racing:usa\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SDIFF bikes:racing:usa bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll note that the [`SDIFF`]() command returns an empty array when the\\\\\\\\ndifference between all sets is empty. You\\'ll also note that the order of sets\\\\\\\\npassed to [`SDIFF`]() matters, since the difference is not commutative.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you want to remove items from a set, you can use the [`SREM`]() command to\\\\\\\\nremove one or more items from a set, or you can use the [`SPOP`]() command to\\\\\\\\nremove a random item from a set. You can also _return_ a random item from a\\\\\\\\nset without removing it using the [`SRANDMEMBER`]() command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n> DEL bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SADD bikes:racing:france bike:1 bike:2 bike:3 bike:4 bike:5\\\\\\\\n(integer) 5\\\\\\\\n> SREM bikes:racing:france bike:1\\\\\\\\n(integer) 1\\\\\\\\n> SPOP bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SMEMBERS bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:5\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n> SRANDMEMBER bikes:racing:france\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"bike:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe max size of a Redis set is 2^32 - 1 (4,294,967,295) members.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='Based on the search results, I found relevant information about implementing a rate limiter using Redis sorted sets.\\n\\n## Implementation Overview\\n\\nRedis sorted sets are well-suited for building **sliding-window rate limiters** to prevent excessive API requests.

Server processes the command and replies with a RESP-typed response\n\n**Example interaction:**\n```\nClient: *2\\r\\n$4\\r\\nLLEN\\r\\n$6\\r\\nmylist\\r\\n\nServer: :48293\\r\\n\n```\n\nThis represents the client sending `LLEN mylist` and the server returning the integer 48293.\n\n### Protocol Versions\n\n- **RESP2**: Standard since Redis 2.0, default for client connections\n- **RESP3**: Introduced in Redis 6.0 (opt-in), superset of RESP2 with additional data types\n- Clients can negotiate protocol version using the `HELLO` command\n\n### Data Types\n\nRESP uses a prefix byte to identify data types:\n\n**RESP2 types:**\n- Simple strings: `+` (e.g., `+OK\\r\\n`)\n- Errors: `-` (e.g., `-ERR unknown command\\r\\n`)\n- Integers: `:` (e.g., `:1000\\r\\n`)\n- Bulk strings: `$` (binary-safe, prefixed with length)\n- Arrays: `*` (can contain mixed types and be nested)\n\n**RESP3 adds:** Booleans, Doubles, Maps, Sets, Nulls, and more.\n\n### Advanced Features\n\n**Pipelining:** Clients can send multiple commands without waiting for individual responses, improving performance by reducing round-trip time (RTT).\n\n**Request-Response Exceptions:**\n- Pub/Sub mode becomes push protocol\n- `MONITOR` command switches to ad-hoc push mode\n- RESP3 supports server-initiated pushes\n\n### Session Handshake\n\nNew connections should start with:\n```\nHELLO <protocol-version> [AUTH ...]\n```\n\nThis allows backward compatibility and returns server information (version, mode, role, etc.).\n\n[来源:

\\\\\"To communicate with the Redis server, Redis clients use a protocol called Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP).\\\\\\\\nWhile the protocol was designed specifically for Redis, you can use it for other client-server software projects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a compromise among the following considerations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Simple to implement.\\\\\\\\n* Fast to parse.\\\\\\\\n* Human readable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP can serialize different data types including integers, strings, and arrays.\\\\\\\\nIt also features an error-specific type.\\\\\\\\nA client sends a request to the Redis server as an array of strings.\\\\\\\\nThe array\\'s contents are the command and its arguments that the server should execute.\\\\\\\\nThe server\\'s reply type is command-specific.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is binary-safe and uses prefixed length to transfer bulk data so it does not require processing bulk data transferred from one process to another.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is the protocol you should implement in your Redis client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe protocol outlined here is used only for client-server communication.\\\\\\\\n[Redis Cluster]() uses a different binary protocol for exchanging messages between nodes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSupport for the first version of the RESP protocol was introduced in Redis 1.2.\\\\\\\\nUsing RESP with Redis 1.2 was optional and had mainly served the purpose of working the kinks out of the protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis 2.0, the protocol\\'s next version, a.k.a RESP2, became the standard communication method for clients with the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[RESP3](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md) is a superset of RESP2 that mainly aims to make a client author\\'s life a little bit easier.\\\\\\\\nRedis 6.0 introduced experimental opt-in support of RESP3\\'s features (excluding streaming strings and streaming aggregates).\\\\\\\\nIn addition, the introduction of the [`HELLO`]() command allows clients to handshake and upgrade the connection\\'s protocol version (see [Client handshake](#client-handshake)).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom Redis version 7 and forward, both RESP2 and RESP3 clients can invoke all core commands.\\\\\\\\nHowever, commands may return differently typed replies for different protocol versions.\\\\\\\\nEach command has descriptions of RESP2 and RESP3 return values that you can reference.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFuture versions of Redis may change the default protocol version, but it is unlikely that RESP2 will become entirely deprecated.\\\\\\\\nIt is possible, however, that new features in upcoming versions will require the use of RESP3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA client connects to a Redis server by creating a TCP connection to its port (the default is 6379).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile RESP is technically non-TCP specific, the protocol is used exclusively with TCP connections (or equivalent stream-oriented connections like Unix sockets) in the context of Redis.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.4024,\\\\n

exceptions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis requests can be [pipelined](#multiple-commands-and-pipelining).\\\\\\\\n  Pipelining enables clients to send multiple commands at once and wait for replies later.\\\\\\\\n* When a RESP2 connection subscribes to a [Pub/Sub]() channel, the protocol changes semantics and becomes a *push* protocol.\\\\\\\\n  The client no longer requires sending commands because the server will automatically send new messages to the client (for the channels the client is subscribed to) as soon as they are received.\\\\\\\\n* The [`MONITOR`]() command.\\\\\\\\n  Invoking the [`MONITOR`]() command switches the connection to an ad-hoc push mode.\\\\\\\\n  The protocol of this mode is not specified but is obvious to parse.\\\\\\\\n* [Protected mode]().\\\\\\\\n  Connections opened from a non-loopback address to a Redis while in protected mode are denied and terminated by the server.\\\\\\\\n  Before terminating the connection, Redis unconditionally sends a `-DENIED` reply, regardless of whether the client writes to the socket.\\\\\\\\n* The [RESP3 Push type](#resp3-pushes).\\\\\\\\n  As the name suggests, a push type allows the server to send out-of-band data to the connection.\\\\\\\\n  The server may push data at any time, and the data isn\\'t necessarily related to specific commands executed by the client.\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\nExcluding

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"RESP is essentially a serialization protocol that supports several data types.\\\\\\\\nIn RESP, the first byte of data determines its type.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis generally uses RESP as a [request-response](#request-response-model) protocol in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Clients send commands to a Redis server as an [array](#arrays) of [bulk strings](#bulk-strings).\\\\\\\\n  The first (and sometimes also the second) bulk string in the array is the command\\'s name.\\\\\\\\n  Subsequent elements of the array are the arguments for the command.\\\\\\\\n* The server replies with a RESP type.\\\\\\\\n  The reply\\'s type is determined by the command\\'s implementation and possibly by the client\\'s protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP is a binary protocol that uses control sequences encoded in standard ASCII.\\\\\\\\nThe `A` character, for example, is encoded with the binary byte of value 65.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the characters CR (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`), LF (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) and SP (` `) have binary byte values of 13, 10 and 32, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` (CRLF) is the protocol\\'s _terminator_, which **always** separates its parts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first byte in an RESP-serialized payload always identifies its type.\\\\\\\\nSubsequent bytes constitute the type\\'s contents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe categorize every RESP data type as either _simple_, _bulk_ or _aggregate_.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimple types are similar to scalars in programming languages that represent plain literal values. Booleans and Integers are such examples.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP strings are either _simple_ or _bulk_.\\\\\\\\nSimple strings never contain carriage return (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r`) or line feed (`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`) characters.\\\\\\\\nBulk strings can contain any binary data and may also be referred to as _binary_ or _blob_.\\\\\\\\nNote that bulk strings may be further encoded and decoded, e.g. with a wide multi-byte encoding, by the client.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAggregates, such as Arrays and Maps, can have varying numbers of sub-elements and nesting levels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following table summarizes the RESP data types that Redis supports:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n| RESP data type | Minimal protocol version | Category | First byte |\\\\\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\\\\\n| [Simple strings](#simple-strings) | RESP2 | Simple | `+` |\\\\\\\\n| [Simple Errors](#simple-errors) | RESP2 | Simple | `-` |\\\\\\\\n| [Integers](#integers) | RESP2 | Simple | `:` |\\\\\\\\n| [Bulk strings](#bulk-strings) | RESP2 | Aggregate | `$` |\\\\\\\\n| [Arrays](#arrays) | RESP2 | Aggregate | `*` |\\\\\\\\n| [Nulls](#nulls) | RESP3 | Simple | `_` |\\\\\\\\n| [Booleans](#booleans) | RESP3 | Simple | `#` |\\\\\\\\n| [Doubles](#doubles) | RESP3 | Simple | `,` |\\\\\\\\n| [Big numbers](#big-numbers) | RESP3 | Simple | `(` |\\\\\\\\n| [Bulk errors](#bulk-errors) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `!` |\\\\\\\\n| [Verbatim strings](#verbatim-strings) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `=` |\\\\\\\\n| [Maps](#maps) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `%` |\\\\\\\\n| [Attributes](#attributes) | RESP3 | Aggregate | <code>&#124;</code> |\\\\\\\\n| [Sets](#sets) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `~` |\\\\\\\\n| [Pushes](#pushes) | RESP3 | Aggregate | `>` |\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"simple-string-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.1516,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244-013\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/protocol-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis serialization protocol specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sending commands to a Redis server\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"New RESP connections should begin the session by calling the [`HELLO`]() command.\\\\\\\\nThis practice accomplishes two things:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. It allows servers to be backward compatible with RESP2 versions.\\\\\\\\n  This is needed in Redis to make the transition to version 3 of the protocol gentler.\\\\\\\\n2. The [`HELLO`]() command returns information about the server and the protocol that the client can use for different goals.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`HELLO`]() command has the following high-level syntax:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    HELLO <protocol-version> [optional-arguments]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first argument of the command is the protocol version we want the connection to be set.\\\\\\\\nBy default, the connection starts in RESP2 mode.\\\\\\\\nIf we specify a connection version that is too big and unsupported by the server, it should reply with a `-NOPROTO` error. Example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 4\\\\\\\\n    Server: -NOPROTO sorry, this protocol version is not supported.\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\nAt that point, the client may retry with a lower protocol version.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, the client can easily detect a server that is only able to speak RESP2:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR unknown command \\'HELLO\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client can then proceed and use RESP2 to communicate with the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that even if the protocol\\'s version is supported, the [`HELLO`]() command may return an error, perform no action and remain in RESP2 mode. \\\\\\\\nFor example, when used with invalid authentication credentials in the command\\'s optional `AUTH` clause:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Client: HELLO 3 AUTH default mypassword\\\\\\\\n    Server: -ERR invalid password\\\\\\\\n    (the connection remains in RESP2 mode)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA successful reply to the [`HELLO`]() command is a map reply.\\\\\\\\nThe information in the reply is partly server-dependent, but certain fields are mandatory for all the RESP3 implementations:\\\\\\\\n* **server**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"redis\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (or other software name).\\\\\\\\n* **version**: the server\\'s version.\\\\\\\\n* **proto**: the highest supported version of the RESP protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn Redis\\' RESP3 implementation, the following fields are also emitted:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **id**: the connection\\'s identifier (ID).\\\\\\\\n* **mode**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"standalone\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cluster\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **role**: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"master\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"replica\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n* **modules**: list of loaded modules as an Array of Bulk Strings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow that you are familiar with the RESP serialization format, you can use it to help write a Redis client library.\\\\\\\\nWe can further specify how the interaction between the client and the server works:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A client sends the Redis server an [array](#arrays) consisting of only bulk strings.\\\\\\\\n* A Redis server replies to clients, sending any valid RESP data type as a reply.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, for example, a typical interaction could be the following.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client sends the command `LLEN mylist` to get the length of the list stored at the key _mylist_.\\\\\\\\nThen the server replies with an [integer](#integers) reply as in the following example (`C:` is the client, `S:` the server).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: $4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: LLEN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: $6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: mylist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    S: :48293\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs usual, we separate different parts of the protocol with newlines for simplicity, but the actual interaction is the client sending `*2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLLEN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$6\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nmylist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n` as a whole.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.9688,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"d015a244-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\":

as RESP arrays.\\\\\\\\nSimilarly, some Redis commands that return collections of elements use arrays as their replies. \\\\\\\\nAn example is the [`LRANGE`]() command that returns elements of a list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP Arrays\\' encoding uses the following format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *<number-of-elements>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n<element-1>...<element-n>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* An asterisk (`*`) as the first byte.\\\\\\\\n* One or more decimal digits (`0`..`9`) as the number of elements in the array as an unsigned, base-10 value.\\\\\\\\n* The CRLF terminator.\\\\\\\\n* An additional RESP type for every element of the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo an empty Array is just the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhereas the encoding of an array consisting of the two bulk strings \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\"world\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nhello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n$5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nworld\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see, after the `*<count>CRLF` part prefixing the array, the other data types that compose the array are concatenated one after the other.\\\\\\\\nFor example, an Array of three integers is encoded as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n:3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nArrays can contain mixed data types.\\\\\\\\nFor instance, the following encoding is of a list of four integers and a bulk string:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :4\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(The raw RESP encoding is split into multiple lines for readability).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first line the server sent is `*5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n`.\\\\\\\\nThis numeric value tells the client that five reply types are about to follow it.\\\\\\\\nThen, every successive reply constitutes an element in the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of the aggregate RESP types support nesting.\\\\\\\\nFor example, a nested array of two arrays is encoded as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    :3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    +Hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    -World\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n(The raw RESP encoding is split into multiple lines for readability).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above encodes a two-element array.\\\\\\\\nThe first element is an array that, in turn, contains three integers (1, 2, 3).\\\\\\\\nThe second element is another array containing a simple string and an error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn some places, the RESP Array type may be referred to as _multi bulk_.\\\\\\\\nThe two are the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<a name=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"nil-array-reply\\\\\\\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n

multiple commands.\\\\\\\\nPipelining is supported, so multiple commands can be sent with a single write operation by the client.\\\\\\\\nThe client can skip reading replies and continue to send the commands one after the other.\\\\\\\\nAll the replies can be read at the end.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor more information, see [Pipelining]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes you may need to send a command to the Redis server but only have `telnet` available.\\\\\\\\nWhile the Redis protocol is simple to implement, it is not ideal for interactive sessions, and `redis-cli` may not always be available.\\\\\\\\nFor this reason, Redis also accepts commands in the _inline command_ format.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following example demonstrates a server/client exchange using an inline command (the server chat starts with `S:`, the client chat with `C:`):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: PING\\\\\\\\n    S: +PONG\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s another example of an inline command where the server returns an integer:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    C: EXISTS somekey\\\\\\\\n    S: :0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically, to issue an inline command, you write space-separated arguments in a telnet session.\\\\\\\\nSince no command starts with `*` (the identifying byte of RESP Arrays), Redis detects this condition and parses your command inline.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the Redis protocol is human-readable and easy to implement, its implementation can exhibit performance similar to that of a binary protocol.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRESP uses prefixed lengths to transfer bulk data.\\\\\\\\nThat makes scanning the payload for special characters unnecessary (unlike parsing JSON, for example).\\\\\\\\nFor the same reason, quoting and escaping the payload isn\\'t needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReading the length of aggregate types (for example, bulk strings or arrays) can be processed with code that performs a single operation per character while at the same time scanning for the CR character.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample (in C):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```c\\\\\\\\n#include <stdio.h>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nint main(void) {\\\\\\\\n    unsigned char *p = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"$123\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\";\\\\\\\\n    int len = 0;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    p++;\\\\\\\\n    while(*p != \\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\') {\\\\\\\\n        len = (len*10)+(*p - \\'0\\');\\\\\\\\n        p++;\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    /* Now p points at \\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\', and the length is in len. */\\\\\\\\n    printf(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"%d\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\", len);\\\\\\\\n    return 0;\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter the first CR is identified, it can be skipped along with the following LF without further processing.\\\\\\\\nThen, the bulk data can be read with a single read operation that doesn\\'t inspect the payload in any way.\\\\\\\\nFinally, the remaining CR and LF characters are discarded without additional processing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile comparable in performance to a binary protocol, the Redis protocol is significantly more straightforward to implement in most high-level languages, reducing the number of bugs in client software.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* For testing purposes, use [Lua\\'s type conversions]() to have Redis reply with any RESP2/RESP3 needed.\\\\\\\\n  As an example, a RESP3 double can be generated like so:\\\\\\\\n  ```\\\\\\\\n  EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return { double = tonumber(ARGV[1]) }\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0 1e0\\\\\\\\n  ```\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.2435,\\\\n

version set for replies with the [`redis.setresp()` function] when it calls `redis.call()` or `redis.pcall()`, the user may opt-in to using RESP3 (with the `HELLO 3` command) for the connection.\\\\\\\\nAlthough the default protocol for incoming client connections is RESP2, the script should honor the user\\'s preference and return adequately-typed RESP3 replies, so the following rules apply on top of those specified in the [Lua to RESP2 type conversion](#lua-to-resp2-type-conversion) section when that is the case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Lua Boolean -> [RESP3 Boolean reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#boolean-reply) (note that this is a change compared to the RESP2, in which returning a Boolean Lua `true` returned the number 1 to the Redis client, and returning a `false` used to return a `null`.\\\\\\\\n* Lua table with a single _map_ field set to an associative Lua table -> [RESP3 map reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#map-type).\\\\\\\\n* Lua table with a single _set_ field set to an associative Lua table -> [RESP3 set reply](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#set-type).

null](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/protocol/RESP3.md#null-reply).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, if the connection is set use the RESP2 protocol, and even if the script replies with RESP3-typed responses, Redis will automatically perform a RESP3 to RESP2 conversion of the reply as is the case for regular commands.\\\\\\\\nThat means, for example, that returning the RESP3 map type to a RESP2 connection will result in the reply being converted to a flat RESP2 array that consists of alternating field names and their values, rather than a RESP3 map.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n

However, only **14 out of 16 bits** are used, giving 2^14 = 16384 slots. This provides good distribution while keeping the slot bitmap compact.\n\n2. **Reasonable cluster size limit**: 16384 slots effectively sets an upper limit of 16384 master nodes, though the recommended maximum is around 1000 nodes for practical operations.\n\n3. **Efficient propagation**: Each node broadcasts its slot configuration in heartbeat messages. With 16384 slots, the bitmap is 2KB (16384 bits / 8), which is reasonable for network transmission. A larger number would increase overhead.\n\n## How Keys Are Mapped\n\nKeys are mapped to hash slots using this algorithm:\n\n```\nHASH_SLOT = CRC16(key) mod 16384\n```\n\n**CRC16 specification used:**\n- Name: XMODEM (also known as ZMODEM or CRC-16/ACORN)\n- Width: 16 bit\n- Poly: 1021 (x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1)\n- Initialization: 0000\n- Output for \"123456789\": 31C3\n\n**Hash Tags Exception**: If a key contains `{...}` brackets, only the substring inside the brackets is hashed. For example:\n- `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` → both hash to the same slot (only `123` is hashed)\n- This allows multi-key operations on keys in the same slot\n\nEach master node is responsible for a subset of the 16384 slots. For example, in a 3-node cluster:\n- Node A: slots 0-5500\n- Node B: slots 5501-11000  \n- Node C: slots 11001-16383\n\n[来源:

hash\\\\\\\\nslot for a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo\\\\\\\\n16384.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,\\\\\\\\nso, for example, you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.\\\\\\\\n* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.\\\\\\\\n* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes it easy to add and remove cluster nodes. For example, if\\\\\\\\nI want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slots from nodes A, B, C\\\\\\\\nto D. Similarly, if I want to remove node A from the cluster, I can just\\\\\\\\nmove the hash slots served by A to B and C. Once node A is empty,\\\\\\\\nI can remove it from the cluster completely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMoving hash slots from a node to another does not require stopping\\\\\\\\nany operations; therefore, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots held by a node, requires no downtime.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all of the keys involved in a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script\\\\\\\\nexecution) belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys\\\\\\\\nto be part of the same hash slot by using a feature called *hash tags*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is\\\\\\\\nthat if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is\\\\\\\\ninside the string is hashed. For example, the keys `user:{123}:profile` and `user:{123}:account` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot because they share the same hash tag. As a result, you can operate on these two keys in the same multi-key operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo remain available when a subset of master nodes are failing or are\\\\\\\\nnot able to communicate with the majority of nodes, Redis Cluster uses a\\\\\\\\nmaster-replica model where every hash slot has from 1 (the master itself) to N\\\\\\\\nreplicas (N-1 additional replica nodes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not\\\\\\\\nable to continue, since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the\\\\\\\\nrange 5501-11000.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, when the cluster is created (or at a later time), we add a replica\\\\\\\\nnode to every master, so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C\\\\\\\\nthat are master nodes, and A1, B1, C1 that are replica nodes.\\\\\\\\nThis way, the system can continue if node B fails.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNode B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new\\\\\\\\nmaster and will continue to operate correctly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, note that if nodes B and B1 fail at the same time, Redis Cluster will not be able to continue to operate.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.2801,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-025\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Configuration handling, propagation, and failovers > Hash slots configuration propagation\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"An important part of Redis Cluster is the mechanism used to propagate the information about which cluster node is serving a given set of hash slots. This is vital to both the startup of a fresh cluster and the ability to upgrade the configuration after a replica was promoted to serve the slots of its failing master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same mechanism allows nodes partitioned away for an indefinite amount of\\\\\\\\ntime to rejoin the cluster in a sensible way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are two ways hash slot configurations are propagated:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Heartbeat messages. The sender of a ping or pong packet always adds information about the set of hash slots it (or its master, if it is a replica) serves.\\\\\\\\n2. `UPDATE` messages. Since in every heartbeat packet there is information about the sender `configEpoch` and set of hash slots served, if a receiver of a heartbeat packet finds the sender information is stale, it will send a packet with new information, forcing the stale node to update its info.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe receiver of a heartbeat or `UPDATE` message uses certain simple rules in\\\\\\\\norder to update its table mapping hash slots to nodes. When a new Redis Cluster node is created, its local hash slot table is simply initialized to `NULL` entries so that each hash slot is not bound or linked to any node. This looks similar to the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n2 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first rule followed by a node in order to update its hash slot table is the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 1**: If a hash slot is unassigned (set to `NULL`), and a known node claims it, I\\'ll modify my hash slot table and associate the claimed hash slots to it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo if we receive a heartbeat from node A claiming to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with a configuration epoch value of 3, the table will be modified to:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n2 -> A [3]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen a new cluster is created, a system administrator needs to manually assign (using the [`CLUSTER ADDSLOTS`](/commands/cluster-addslots) command, via the redis-cli command line tool, or by any other means) the slots served by each master node only to the node itself, and the information will rapidly propagate across the cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever this rule is not enough. We know that hash slot mapping can change\\\\\\\\nduring two events:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A replica replaces its master during a failover.\\\\\\\\n2. A slot is resharded from a node to a different one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor now let\\'s focus on failovers. When a replica fails over its master, it obtains\\\\\\\\na configuration epoch which is guaranteed to be greater than the one of its\\\\\\\\nmaster (and more generally greater than any other configuration epoch\\\\\\\\ngenerated previously). For example node B, which is a replica of A, may failover\\\\\\\\nA with configuration epoch of 4. It will start to send heartbeat packets\\\\\\\\n(the first time mass-broadcasting cluster-wide) and because of the following\\\\\\\\nsecond rule, receivers will update their hash slot tables:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Rule 2**: If a hash slot is already assigned, and a known node is advertising it using a `configEpoch` that is greater than the `configEpoch` of the master currently associated with the slot, I\\'ll rebind the hash slot to the new node.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo after receiving messages from B that claim to serve hash slots 1 and 2 with configuration epoch of 4, the receivers will update their table in the following way:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n0 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n1 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n2 -> B [4]\\\\\\\\n...\\\\\\\\n16383 -> NULL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLiveness property: because of the second rule, eventually all nodes in the cluster will agree that the owner of a slot is the one with the greatest `configEpoch` among the nodes advertising it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis mechanism in Redis Cluster is called **last failover wins**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe same happens during resharding. When a node importing a hash slot completes\\\\\\\\nthe import operation, its configuration epoch is incremented to make sure the\\\\\\\\nchange will be propagated throughout the cluster.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.8861,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"9f2d8d5c-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis cluster specification\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redirection and resharding > MOVED Redirection\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A Redis client is free to send queries to every node in the cluster, including\\\\\\\\nreplica nodes.

OS**：当你删除大量键后，Redis 进程的 RSS（常驻内存集）不会立即下降。例如，存入 5GB 数据后删除 2GB，RSS 仍可能保持在 5GB，尽管 Redis 实际使用约 3GB。\n\n2. **内存页共享**：被删除的键和仍存在的键往往分配在相同的内存页上，导致分配器难以释放整页内存。\n\n3. **碎片率计算**：`fragmentation_ratio = RSS / 实际使用内存`。当峰值内存远大于当前使用内存时，这个比率会很高。\n\n## 解决方案\n\n### 1. 理解内存分配器的重用机制\n- 分配器会**智能重用**已释放的内存块\n- 当你重新写入数据时，RSS 不会继续增长，而是复用之前释放的空间\n- 这意味着碎片问题在持续写入后会自然缓解\n\n### 2. 按峰值内存规划容量\n- **必须按峰值内存（10GB）而非平均内存（5GB）来规划服务器容量**\n- 即使大部分时间只用 5GB，偶尔需要 10GB 就必须预留 10GB\n\n### 3. 配置 maxmemory 限制\n```bash\n# 在配置文件中设置\nmaxmemory 10gb\n\n# 或运行时设置\nCONFIG SET maxmemory 10737418240\n```\n\n建议同时设置淘汰策略：\n```bash\nmaxmemory-policy noeviction  # 达到限制时返回错误，而非自动淘汰\n```\n\n### 4. 监控碎片率\n使用 `INFO memory` 查看：\n```bash\nredis-cli INFO memory | grep fragmentation\n```\n\n注意：**碎片率在峰值后下降的场景下不可靠**，因为 RSS 反映的是历史峰值。\n\n### 5. 重启 Redis（终极方案）\n如果碎片严重影响性能且无法通过重用缓解，可以考虑：\n- 主从切换后重启旧主节点\n- 使用持久化（RDB/AOF）重启恢复\n\n## 你的场景分析\n\n10GB RSS 但只存 2GB 数据，碎片率约 5:1，说明：\n- 曾经存储过接近 10GB 的数据\n- 删除了大量键后，内存页无法完全释放\n- 如果后续继续写入数据，分配器会重用这 8GB 空闲空间，RSS 不会继续增长\n\n**建议**：如果这是正常业务波动，无需特殊处理；如果是一次性数据清理后的常态，考虑重启或迁移数据到新实例。\n\n---\n\n[来源:

as the `maxmemory`\\\\\\\\nsetting enables (however there are small extra allocations possible).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe exact value can be set in the configuration file or set later via\\\\\\\\n[`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set) (for more info, see [Using memory as an LRU cache]()).\\\\\\\\nThere are a few things that should be noted about how Redis manages memory:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis will not always free up (return) memory to the OS when keys are removed.\\\\\\\\nThis is not something special about Redis, but it is how most malloc() implementations work.\\\\\\\\nFor example, if you fill an instance with 5GB worth of data, and then\\\\\\\\nremove the equivalent of 2GB of data, the Resident Set Size (also known as\\\\\\\\nthe RSS, which is the number of memory pages consumed by the process)\\\\\\\\nwill probably still be around 5GB, even if Redis will claim that the user\\\\\\\\nmemory is around 3GB.  This happens because the underlying allocator can\\'t easily release the memory.\\\\\\\\nFor example, often most of the removed keys were allocated on the same pages as the other keys that still exist.\\\\\\\\n* The previous point means that you need to provision memory based on your\\\\\\\\n**peak memory usage**. If your workload from time to time requires 10GB, even if\\\\\\\\nmost of the time 5GB could do, you need to provision for 10GB.\\\\\\\\n* However allocators are smart and are able to reuse free chunks of memory,\\\\\\\\nso after you free 2GB of your 5GB data set, when you start adding more keys\\\\\\\\nagain, you\\'ll see the RSS (Resident Set Size) stay steady and not grow\\\\\\\\nmore, as you add up to 2GB of additional keys. The allocator is basically\\\\\\\\ntrying to reuse the 2GB of memory previously (logically) freed.\\\\\\\\n* Because of all this, the fragmentation ratio is not reliable when you\\\\\\\\nhad a memory usage that at the peak is much larger than the currently used memory.\\\\\\\\nThe fragmentation is calculated as the physical memory actually used (the RSS\\\\\\\\nvalue) divided by the amount of memory currently in use (as the sum of all\\\\\\\\nthe allocations performed by Redis). Because the RSS reflects the peak memory,\\\\\\\\nwhen the (virtually) used memory is low since a lot of keys/values were freed, but the RSS is high, the ratio `RSS / mem_used` will be very high.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf `maxmemory` is not set Redis will keep allocating memory as it sees\\\\\\\\nfit and thus it can (gradually) eat up all your free memory.\\\\\\\\nTherefore it is generally advisable to configure some limits. You may also\\\\\\\\nwant to set `maxmemory-policy` to `noeviction` (which is *not* the default\\\\\\\\nvalue in some older versions of Redis).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt makes Redis return an out-of-memory error for write commands if and when it reaches the \\\\\\\\nlimit - which in turn may result in errors in the application but will not render the \\\\\\\\nwhole machine dead because of memory starvation.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='根据检索结果，我找到了 Redis 内存碎片问题的详细说明。\\n\\n## 内存碎片产生原因\\n\\nRedis 的内存碎片问题源于底层内存分配器（malloc）的工作机制：\\n\\n1. **删除键后内存不会立即归还给 OS**：当你删除大量键后，Redis 进程的 RSS（常驻内存集）不会立即下降。例如，存入 5GB 数据后删除 2GB，RSS 仍可能保持在 5GB，尽管 Redis 实际使用约 3GB。\\n\\n2. **内存页共享**：被删除的键和仍存在的键往往分配在相同的内存页上，导致分配器难以释放整页内存。\\n\\n3. **碎片率计算**：`fragmentation_ratio = RSS / 实际使用内存`。当峰值内存远大于当前使用内存时，这个比率会很高。\\n\\n## 解决方案\\n\\n### 1. 理解内存分配器的重用机制\\n- 分配器会**智能重用**已释放的内存块\\n- 当你重新写入数据时，RSS 不会继续增长，而是复用之前释放的空间\\n- 这意味着碎片问题在持续写入后会自然缓解\\n\\n### 2. 按峰值内存规划容量\\n- **必须按峰值内存（10GB）而非平均内存（5GB）来规划服务器容量**\\n- 即使大部分时间只用 5GB，偶尔需要 10GB 就必须预留 10GB\\n\\n### 3. 配置 maxmemory 限制\\n```bash\\n# 在配置文件中设置\\nmaxmemory 10gb\\n\\n# 或运行时设置\\nCONFIG SET maxmemory 10737418240\\n```\\n\\n建议同时设置淘汰策略：\\n```bash\\nmaxmemory-policy noeviction  # 达到限制时返回错误，而非自动淘汰\\n```\\n\\n### 4. 监控碎片率\\n使用 `INFO memory` 查看：\\n```bash\\nredis-cli INFO memory | grep fragmentation\\n```\\n\\n注意：**碎片率在峰值后下降的场景下不可靠**，因为 RSS 反映的是历史峰值。\\n\\n### 5. 重启 Redis（终极方案）\\n如果碎片严重影响性能且无法通过重用缓解，可以考虑：\\n- 主从切换后重启旧主节点\\n- 使用持久化（RDB/AOF）重启恢复\\n\\n## 你的场景分析\\n\\n10GB RSS 但只存 2GB 数据，碎片率约 5:1，说明：\\n- 曾经存储过接近 10GB 的数据\\n- 删除了大量键后，内存页无法完全释放\\n- 如果后续继续写入数据，分配器会重用这 8GB 空闲空间，RSS 不会继续增长\\n\\n**建议**：如果这是正常业务波动，无需特殊处理；如果是一次性数据清理后的常态，考虑重启或迁移数据到新实例。\\n\\n---\\n\\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Memory allocation]')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "根据检索结果，我找到了 Redis 内存碎片问题的详细说明。\n\n## 内存碎片产生原因\n\nRedis 的内存碎片问题源于底层内存分配器（malloc）的工作机制：\n\n1. **删除键后内存不会立即归还给 OS**：当你删除大量键后，Redis 进程的 RSS（常驻内存集）不会立即下降。例如，存入 5GB 数据后删除 2GB，RSS 仍可能保持在 5GB，尽管 Redis 实际使用约 3GB。\n\n2. **内存页共享**：被删除的键和仍存在的键往往分配在相同的内存页上，导致分配器难以释放整页内存。\n\n3. **碎片率计算**：`fragmentation_ratio = RSS / 实际使用内存`。当峰值内存远大于当前使用内存时，这个比率会很高。\n\n## 解决方案\n\n### 1. 理解内存分配器的重用机制\n- 分配器会**智能重用**已释放的内存块\n- 当你重新写入数据时，RSS 不会继续增长，而是复用之前释放的空间\n- 这意味着碎片问题在持续写入后会自然缓解\n\n### 2. 按峰值内存规划容量\n- **必须按峰值内存（10GB）而非平均内存（5GB）来规划服务器容量**\n- 即使大部分时间只用 5GB，偶尔需要 10GB 就必须预留 10GB\n\n### 3. 配置 maxmemory 限制\n```bash\n# 在配置文件中设置\nmaxmemory 10gb\n\n# 或运行时设置\nCONFIG SET maxmemory 10737418240\n```\n\n建议同时设置淘汰策略：\n```bash\nmaxmemory-policy noeviction  # 达到限制时返回错误，而非自动淘汰\n```\n\n### 4. 监控碎片率\n使用 `INFO memory` 查看：\n```bash\nredis-cli INFO memory | grep fragmentation\n```\n\n注意：**碎片率在峰值后下降的场景下不可靠**，因为 RSS 反映的是历史峰值。\n\n### 5. 重启 Redis（终极方案）\n如果碎片严重影响性能且无法通过重用缓解，可以考虑：\n- 主从切换后重启旧主节点\n- 使用持久化（RDB/AOF）重启恢复\n\n## 你的场景分析\n\n10GB RSS 但只存 2GB 数据，碎片率约 5:1，说明：\n- 曾经存储过接近 10GB 的数据\n- 删除了大量键后，内存页无法完全释放\n- 如果后续继续写入数据，分配器会重用这 8GB 空闲空间，RSS 不会继续增长\n\n**建议**：如果这是正常业务波动，无需特殊处理；如果是一次性数据清理后的常态，考虑重启或迁移数据到新实例。\n\n---\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/optimization/memory-optimization.md > Memory allocation]", "session_id": "3af39206-7e3a-431c-8328-a46daa70af77", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 96736, "total_cost_usd": 0.0627105, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1226, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2452, "cache_read_input_tokens": 30661, "output_tokens": 1037, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

high availability:\n\n## Basic 3-Node Setup\n\nThe recommended configuration uses **three boxes**, each running both a Redis process and a Sentinel process:\n\n```\n       +----+\n       | M1 |  (Master)\n       | S1 |  (Sentinel)\n       +----+\n          |\n+----+    |    +----+\n| R2 |----+----| R3 |  (Replicas)\n| S2 |         | S3 |  (Sentinels)\n+----+         +----+\n\nConfiguration: quorum = 2\n```\n\n## Key Configuration Points\n\n1. **Quorum Setting**: Set `quorum = 2` so that at least 2 Sentinels must agree about a master failure before initiating failover.\n\n2. **Prevent Data Loss During Partitions**: Add these settings to your Redis master configuration to stop accepting writes if disconnected from replicas:\n\n```\nmin-replicas-to-write 1\nmin-replicas-max-lag 10\n```\n\nThis ensures the master becomes unavailable after 10 seconds if it can't replicate to at least 1 replica, preventing split-brain scenarios where clients write to an isolated old master.\n\n## How It Works\n\n- If master M1 fails, Sentinels S2 and S3 will agree about the failure and authorize a failover\n- One of the replicas (R2 or R3) will be promoted to master\n- Clients can continue operations with the new master\n- The trade-off: if both replicas are down, the master will stop accepting writes\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Always deploy at least 3 Sentinels in 3 different boxes** to avoid split-brain conditions\n- Redis + Sentinel is an **eventually consistent system** where acknowledged writes can be lost during partitions due to asynchronous replication\n- Sentinel state is persisted in the configuration file, so it's safe to stop and restart Sentinel processes\n\n[来源:

configurations are eventually consistent, so every partition will\\\\\\\\nconverge to the higher configuration available.\\\\\\\\nHowever in a real-world system using Sentinel there are three different players:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Redis instances.\\\\\\\\n* Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* Clients.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to define the behavior of the system we have to consider all three.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe following is a simple network where there are 3 nodes, each running\\\\\\\\na Redis instance, and a Sentinel instance:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n                +-------------+\\\\\\\\n                | Sentinel 1  |----- Client A\\\\\\\\n                | Redis 1 (M) |\\\\\\\\n                +-------------+\\\\\\\\n                        |\\\\\\\\n                        |\\\\\\\\n    +-------------+     |          +------------+\\\\\\\\n    | Sentinel 2  |-----+-- // ----| Sentinel 3 |----- Client B\\\\\\\\n    | Redis 2 (S) |                | Redis 3 (M)|\\\\\\\\n    +-------------+                +------------+\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this system the original state was that Redis 3 was the master, while\\\\\\\\nRedis 1 and 2 were replicas. A partition occurred isolating the old master.\\\\\\\\nSentinels 1 and 2 started a failover promoting Sentinel 1 as the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Sentinel properties guarantee that Sentinel 1 and 2 now have the new\\\\\\\\nconfiguration for the master. However Sentinel 3 has still the old configuration\\\\\\\\nsince it lives in a different partition.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe know that Sentinel 3 will get its configuration updated when the network\\\\\\\\npartition will heal, however what happens during the partition if there\\\\\\\\nare clients partitioned with the old master?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nClients will be still able to write to Redis 3, the old master. When the\\\\\\\\npartition will rejoin, Redis 3 will be turned into a replica of Redis 1, and\\\\\\\\nall the data written during the partition will be lost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDepending on your configuration you may want or not that this scenario happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a cache, it could be handy that Client B is still able to write to the old master, even if its data will be lost.\\\\\\\\n* If you are using Redis as a store, this is not good and you need to configure the system in order to partially prevent this problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince Redis is asynchronously replicated, there is no way to totally prevent data loss in this scenario, however you can bound the divergence between Redis 3 and Redis 1\\\\\\\\nusing the following Redis configuration option:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration the Redis 3 in the above example will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel 3 configuration will converge to\\\\\\\\nthe new one, and Client B will be able to fetch a valid configuration and continue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn general Redis + Sentinel as a whole are an **eventually consistent system** where the merge function is **last failover wins**, and the data from old masters are discarded to replicate the data of the current master, so there is always a window for losing acknowledged writes. This is due to Redis asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication and the discarding nature of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"virtual\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merge function of the system. Note that this is not a limitation of Sentinel itself, and if you orchestrate the failover with a strongly consistent replicated state machine, the same properties will still apply. There are only two ways to avoid losing acknowledged writes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Use synchronous replication (and a proper consensus algorithm to run a replicated state machine).\\\\\\\\n2. Use an eventually consistent system where different versions of the same object can be merged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis currently is not able to use any of the above systems, and is currently outside the development goals. However there are proxies implementing solution \\\\\\\\\\\\\"2\\\\\\\\\\\\\" on top of Redis stores such as SoundCloud [Roshi](https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi), or Netflix [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel persistent state\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel state is persisted in the sentinel configuration file. For example\\\\\\\\nevery time a new configuration is received, or created (leader Sentinels), for\\\\\\\\na master, the configuration is persisted on disk together with the configuration\\\\\\\\nepoch. This means that it is safe to stop and restart Sentinel processes.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 4.0283,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel quick start > Example Sentinel deployments > Example 4: Sentinel client side with less than three clients\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"The setup described in the Example 3 cannot be used if there are less than\\\\\\\\nthree boxes in the client side (for example three web servers).

However in\\\\\\\\nthe above setup there is a higher risk due to clients being partitioned away\\\\\\\\nwith an old master, like in the following picture:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n             +----+\\\\\\\\n             | M1 |\\\\\\\\n             | S1 | <- C1 (writes will be lost)\\\\\\\\n             +----+\\\\\\\\n                |\\\\\\\\n                /\\\\\\\\n                /\\\\\\\\n    +------+    |    +----+\\\\\\\\n    | [M2] |----+----| R3 |\\\\\\\\n    | S2   |         | S3 |\\\\\\\\n    +------+         +----+\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this case a network partition isolated the old master M1, so the\\\\\\\\nreplica R2 is promoted to master. However clients, like C1, that are\\\\\\\\nin the same partition as the old master, may continue to write data\\\\\\\\nto the old master. This data will be lost forever since when the partition\\\\\\\\nwill heal, the master will be reconfigured as a replica of the new master,\\\\\\\\ndiscarding its data set.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis problem can be mitigated using the following Redis replication\\\\\\\\nfeature, that allows to stop accepting writes if a master detects that\\\\\\\\nit is no longer able to transfer its writes to the specified number of replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-to-write 1\\\\\\\\n    min-replicas-max-lag 10\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the above configuration (please see the self-commented `redis.conf` example in the Redis distribution for more information) a Redis instance, when acting as a master, will stop accepting writes if it can\\'t write to at least 1 replica. Since replication is asynchronous *not being able to write* actually means that the replica is either disconnected, or is not sending us asynchronous acknowledges for more than the specified `max-lag` number of seconds.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing this configuration, the old Redis master M1 in the above example, will become unavailable after 10 seconds. When the partition heals, the Sentinel configuration will converge to the new one, the client C1 will be able to fetch a valid configuration and will continue with the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever there is no free lunch. With this refinement, if the two replicas are\\\\\\\\ndown, the master will stop accepting writes.

scripts:\n\n## Key Differences\n\n**Redis Functions (introduced in Redis 7.0):**\n- **First-class database artifacts** — managed by Redis itself, persisted via AOF and replicated to replicas\n- **Declared before use** — loaded once at startup, no runtime loading required\n- **Named and versioned** — each function has a unique user-defined name for easier tracing\n- **Organized in libraries** — multiple functions can share code within the same library\n- **Durable** — stored alongside data, survive restarts and failovers\n- **No transaction failures** — since they're pre-loaded, no risk of missing scripts in transactions\n\n**Lua Scripts (EVAL/EVALSHA):**\n- **Ephemeral** — part of the client application, not the database\n- **Sent on every execution** — unless cached with EVALSHA (but cache can be lost)\n- **Anonymous** — identified only by SHA1 digest, making debugging harder\n- **No code sharing** — scripts can't call other scripts\n- **Volatile** — lost after server restart, failover, or SCRIPT FLUSH\n- **Application responsibility** — client must reload scripts if missing\n\n## When to Use Which?\n\n**Use Redis Functions when:**\n- Building reusable server-side logic that multiple applications will use\n- You need guaranteed availability without runtime loading\n- Code sharing between functions is important\n- You want easier debugging with meaningful function names\n- The logic is part of your data schema/consistency layer\n\n**Use Lua Scripts (EVAL) when:**\n- Lightweight, application-specific logic\n- Rapid prototyping or one-off operations\n- The script is tightly coupled to a specific application version\n- You need the Lua debugger (not available for Functions)\n\n## Common Ground\n\nBoth provide:\n- Atomic execution (blocks server during runtime)\n- Access to Redis commands via `redis.call()` / `redis.pcall()`\n- Same Lua 5.1 interpreter and API\n- Script effects replication (default since Redis 5.0)\n\n[来源:

the difference between the two functions lies in the manner in which runtime errors (such as syntax errors, for example) are handled.\\\\\\\\nErrors raised from calling `redis.call()` function are returned directly to the client that had executed it.\\\\\\\\nConversely, errors encountered when calling the `redis.pcall()` function are returned to the script\\'s execution context instead for possible handling.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, consider the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return redis.call(\\'SET\\', KEYS[1], ARGV[1])\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 1 foo bar\\\\\\\\nOK\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe above script accepts one key name and one value as its input arguments.\\\\\\\\nWhen executed, the script calls the [`SET`]() command to set the input key, _foo_, with the string value \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bar\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUntil this point, we\\'ve used the [`EVAL`]() command to run our script.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhenever we call [`EVAL`](), we also include the script\\'s source code with the request.\\\\\\\\nRepeatedly calling [`EVAL`]() to execute the same set of parameterized scripts, wastes both network bandwidth and also has some overheads in Redis.\\\\\\\\nNaturally, saving on network and compute resources is key, so, instead, Redis provides a caching mechanism for scripts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery script you execute with [`EVAL`]() is stored in a dedicated cache that the server keeps.\\\\\\\\nThe cache\\'s contents are organized by the scripts\\' SHA1 digest sums, so the SHA1 digest sum of a script uniquely identifies it in the cache.\\\\\\\\nYou can verify this behavior by running [`EVAL`]() and calling [`INFO`]() afterward.\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ll notice that the _used_memory_scripts_eval_ and _number_of_cached_scripts_ metrics grow with every new script that\\'s executed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs mentioned above, dynamically-generated scripts are an anti-pattern.\\\\\\\\nGenerating scripts during the application\\'s runtime may, and probably will, exhaust the host\\'s memory resources for caching them.\\\\\\\\nInstead, scripts should be as generic as possible and provide customized execution via their arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA script is loaded to the server\\'s cache by calling the [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() command and providing its source code.\\\\\\\\nThe server doesn\\'t execute the script, but instead just compiles and loads it to the server\\'s cache.\\\\\\\\nOnce loaded, you can execute the cached script with the SHA1 digest returned from the server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s an example

in the database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhereas ephemeral scripts are considered a part of the application\\'s domain, functions extend the database server itself with user-provided logic.\\\\\\\\nThey can be used to expose a richer API composed of core Redis commands, similar to modules, developed once, loaded at startup, and used repeatedly by various applications / clients.\\\\\\\\nEvery function has a unique user-defined name, making it much easier to call and trace its execution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe design of Redis Functions also attempts to demarcate between the programming language used for writing functions and their management by the server.\\\\\\\\nLua, the only language interpreter that Redis presently support as an embedded execution engine, is meant to be simple and easy to learn.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the choice of Lua as a language still presents many Redis users with a challenge.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe Redis Functions feature makes no assumptions about the implementation\\'s language.\\\\\\\\nAn execution engine that is part of the definition of the function handles running it.\\\\\\\\nAn engine can theoretically execute functions in any language as long as it respects several rules (such as the ability to terminate an executing function).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPresently, as noted above, Redis ships with a single embedded [Lua 5.1]() engine.\\\\\\\\nThere are plans to support additional engines in the future.\\\\\\\\nRedis functions can use all of Lua\\'s available capabilities to ephemeral scripts,\\\\\\\\nwith the only exception being the [Redis Lua scripts debugger]().\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions also simplify development by enabling code sharing.\\\\\\\\nEvery function belongs to a single library, and any given library can consist of multiple functions.\\\\\\\\nThe library\\'s contents are immutable, and selective updates of its functions aren\\'t allowed.\\\\\\\\nInstead, libraries are updated as a whole with all of their functions together in one operation.\\\\\\\\nThis allows calling functions from other functions within the same library, or sharing code between functions by using a common code in library-internal methods, that can also take language native arguments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions are intended to better support the use case of maintaining a consistent view for data entities through a logical schema, as mentioned above.\\\\\\\\nAs such, functions are stored alongside the data itself.\\\\\\\\nFunctions are also persisted to the AOF file and replicated from master to replicas, so they are as durable as the data itself.\\\\\\\\nWhen Redis is used as an ephemeral cache, additional mechanisms (described below) are required to make functions more durable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLike all other operations in Redis, the execution of a function is atomic.\\\\\\\\nA function\\'s execution blocks all server activities during its entire time, similarly to the semantics of [transactions]().\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\nThe blocking semantics of an executed function apply to all connected clients at all times.\\\\\\\\nBecause running a function blocks the Redis server, functions are meant to finish executing quickly, so you should avoid using long-running functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n

very efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis guarantees the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\nWhile executing the script, all server activities are blocked during its entire runtime.\\\\\\\\nThese semantics mean that all of the script\\'s effects either have yet to happen or had already happened.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripting offers several properties that can be valuable in many cases.\\\\\\\\nThese include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Providing locality by executing logic where data lives. Data locality reduces overall latency and saves networking resources.\\\\\\\\n* Blocking semantics that ensure the script\\'s atomic execution.\\\\\\\\n* Enabling the composition of simple capabilities that are either missing from Redis or are too niche to be a part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLua lets you run part of your application logic inside Redis.\\\\\\\\nSuch scripts can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types atomically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScripts are executed in Redis by an embedded execution engine.\\\\\\\\nPresently, Redis supports a single scripting engine, the [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter.\\\\\\\\nPlease refer to the [Redis Lua API Reference]() page for complete documentation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlthough the server executes them, Eval scripts are regarded as a part of the client-side application, which is why they\\'re not named, versioned, or persisted.\\\\\\\\nSo all scripts may need to be reloaded by the application at any time if missing (after a server restart, fail-over to a replica, etc.).\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, [Redis Functions]() offer an alternative approach to programmability which allow the server itself to be extended with additional programmed logic.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe\\'ll start scripting with Redis by using the [`EVAL`]() command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s our first example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n> EVAL \\\\\\\\\\\\\"return \\'Hello, scripting!\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\" 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hello, scripting!\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this example, [`EVAL`]() takes two arguments.\\\\\\\\nThe first argument is a string that consists of the script\\'s Lua source code.\\\\\\\\nThe script doesn\\'t need to include any definitions of Lua function.\\\\\\\\nIt is just a Lua program that will run in the Redis engine\\'s context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe second argument is the number of arguments that follow the script\\'s body, starting from the third argument, representing Redis key names.\\\\\\\\nIn this example, we used the value _0_ because we didn\\'t provide the script with any arguments, whether the names of keys or not.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.4927,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3ff5468a\\\\\",\\\\n

\\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Starting with Redis 3.2, it is possible to select an alternative replication method.\\\\\\\\nInstead of replicating whole scripts, we can replicate the write commands generated by the script.\\\\\\\\nWe call this **script effects replication**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:**\\\\\\\\nstarting with Redis 5.0, script effects replication is the default mode and does not need to be explicitly enabled.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn this replication mode, while Lua scripts are executed, Redis collects all the commands executed by the Lua scripting engine that actually modify the dataset.\\\\\\\\nWhen the script execution finishes, the sequence of commands that the script generated are wrapped into a [`MULTI`]()/[`EXEC`]() [transaction]() and are sent to the replicas and AOF.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is useful in several ways depending on the use case:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* When the script is slow to compute, but the effects can be summarized by a few write commands, it is a shame to re-compute the script on the replicas or when reloading the AOF.\\\\\\\\n  In this case, it is much better to replicate just the effects of the script.\\\\\\\\n* When script effects replication is enabled, the restrictions on non-deterministic functions are removed.\\\\\\\\n  You can, for example, use the [`TIME`]() or [`SRANDMEMBER`]() commands inside your scripts freely at any place.\\\\\\\\n* The Lua PRNG in this mode is seeded randomly on every call.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnless already enabled by the server\\'s configuration or defaults (before Redis 7.0), you need to issue the following Lua command before the script performs a write:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.replicate_commands()\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe [`redis.replicate_commands()`]() function returns _true) if script effects replication was enabled;\\\\\\\\notherwise, if the function was called after the script already called a write command,\\\\\\\\nit returns _false_, and normal whole script replication is used.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis function is deprecated as of Redis 7.0, and while you can still call it, it will always succeed.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\":

executed on the server. This feature, which became available in Redis 7, supersedes the use of [EVAL]() in prior versions of Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrior versions of Redis made scripting available only via the [`EVAL`]() command, which allows a Lua script to be sent for execution by the server.\\\\\\\\nThe core use cases for [Eval Scripts]() is executing part of your application logic inside Redis, efficiently and atomically.\\\\\\\\nSuch script can perform conditional updates across multiple keys, possibly combining several different data types.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing [`EVAL`]() requires that the application sends the entire script for execution every time.\\\\\\\\nBecause this results in network and script compilation overheads, Redis provides an optimization in the form of the [`EVALSHA`]() command. By first calling [`SCRIPT LOAD`]() to obtain the script\\'s SHA1, the application can invoke it repeatedly afterward with its digest alone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy design, Redis only caches the loaded scripts.\\\\\\\\nThat means that the script cache can become lost at any time, such as after calling [`SCRIPT FLUSH`](), after restarting the server, or when failing over to a replica.\\\\\\\\nThe application is responsible for reloading scripts during runtime if any are missing.\\\\\\\\nThe underlying assumption is that scripts are a part of the application and not maintained by the Redis server.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis approach suits many light-weight scripting use cases, but introduces several difficulties once an application becomes complex and relies more heavily on scripting, namely:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. All client application instances must maintain a copy of all scripts. That means having some mechanism that applies script updates to all of the application\\'s instances.\\\\\\\\n1. Calling cached scripts within the context of a [transaction]() increases the probability of the transaction failing because of a missing script. Being more likely to fail makes using cached scripts as building blocks of workflows less attractive.\\\\\\\\n1. SHA1 digests are meaningless, making debugging the system extremely hard (e.g., in a [`MONITOR`]() session).\\\\\\\\n1. When used naively, [`EVAL`]() promotes an anti-pattern in which scripts the client application renders verbatim scripts instead of responsibly using the [`KEYS` and `ARGV` Lua APIs]().\\\\\\\\n1. Because they are ephemeral, a script can\\'t call another script. This makes sharing and reusing code between scripts nearly impossible, short of client-side preprocessing (see the first point).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo address these needs while avoiding breaking changes to already-established and well-liked ephemeral scripts, Redis v7.0 introduces Redis Functions.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.9564,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\":

total queries (similar to Apache's `ab` utility).\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -q -n 100000\n```\n\n### Key Options\n\n```bash\nredis-benchmark [-h <host>] [-p <port>] [-c <clients>] [-n <requests>] [-k <boolean>]\n\n-h <hostname>      Server hostname (default 127.0.0.1)\n-p <port>          Server port (default 6379)\n-c <clients>       Number of parallel connections (default 50)\n-n <requests>      Total number of requests (default 100000)\n-d <size>          Data size of SET/GET value in bytes (default 3)\n-P <numreq>        Pipeline requests (default 1, no pipeline)\n-t <tests>         Only run specific tests (comma-separated)\n-q                 Quiet mode - just show query/sec values\n--threads <num>    Enable multi-thread mode\n--cluster          Enable cluster mode\n```\n\n### Common Scenarios\n\n**Test specific commands:**\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -t set,lpush -n 100000 -q\n```\n\n**Use pipelining for higher throughput:**\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\n```\n\n**Random key space (more realistic):**\n```bash\nredis-benchmark -t set -r 100000 -n 1000000\n```\n\n## Alternative Third-Party Tools\n\n1. **[memtier_benchmark](https://github.com/redislabs/memtier_benchmark)** - NoSQL Redis and Memcache traffic generation tool from Redis Labs\n2. **[rpc-perf](https://github.com/twitter/rpc-perf)** - RPC benchmarking tool from Twitter (supports Redis and Memcache)\n3. **[YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB)** - Yahoo's benchmarking framework with clients for many databases including Redis\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n- Use pipelining (`-P` option) to achieve realistic throughput\n- Test with random keys (`-r` option) to simulate real workloads\n- Network and CPU are typically the limiting factors\n- Redis is single-threaded for command execution\n- Use multiple connections to properly stress test\n\n[Source:

In Redis the difference\\\\\\\\nbetween such a synthetic benchmark and a real one is not huge since it is an\\\\\\\\nin-memory system, however it is possible to stress cache misses and in general\\\\\\\\nto simulate a more real-world work load by using a large key space.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is obtained by using the `-r` switch. For instance if I want to run\\\\\\\\none million SET operations, using a random key for every operation out of\\\\\\\\n100k possible keys, I\\'ll use the following command line:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli flushall\\\\\\\\n    OK\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -t set -r 100000 -n 1000000\\\\\\\\n    ====== SET ======\\\\\\\\n      1000000 requests completed in 13.86 seconds\\\\\\\\n      50 parallel clients\\\\\\\\n      3 bytes payload\\\\\\\\n      keep alive: 1\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    99.76% `<=` 1 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    99.98% `<=` 2 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    100.00% `<=` 3 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n    72144.87 requests per second\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-cli dbsize\\\\\\\\n    (integer) 99993\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default every client (the benchmark simulates 50 clients if not otherwise\\\\\\\\nspecified with `-c`) sends the next command only when the reply of the previous\\\\\\\\ncommand is received, this means that the server will likely need a read call\\\\\\\\nin order to read each command from every client. Also RTT is paid as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis supports [pipelining](/topics/pipelining), so it is possible to send\\\\\\\\nmultiple commands at once, a feature often exploited by real world applications.\\\\\\\\nRedis pipelining is able to dramatically improve the number of operations per\\\\\\\\nsecond a server is able to deliver.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is an example of running the benchmark in a MacBook Air 11\\\\\\\\\\\\\" using a\\\\\\\\npipelining of 16 commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    $ redis-benchmark -n 1000000 -t set,get -P 16 -q\\\\\\\\n    SET: 1536098.25 requests per second, p50=0.479 msec                     \\\\\\\\n    GET: 1811594.25 requests per second, p50=0.391 msec\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUsing pipelining results in a significant increase in performance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPitfalls and misconceptions\\\\\\\\n---------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first point is obvious: the golden rule of a useful benchmark is to\\\\\\\\nonly compare apples and apples. Different versions of Redis can be compared\\\\\\\\non the same workload for instance. Or the same version of Redis, but with\\\\\\\\ndifferent options. If you plan to compare Redis to something else, then it is\\\\\\\\nimportant to evaluate the functional and technical differences, and take them\\\\\\\\nin account.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is a server, hence, all commands involve network round trips. Embedded data stores do not involve network and protocol management. When comparing such products to Redis, command execution times should be used instead of end-to-end times.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis commands return an acknowledgment for all usual commands. Some other data stores do not. Comparing Redis to stores involving one-way queries is only mildly useful.\\\\\\\\n+ Naively iterating on synchronous Redis commands does not benchmark Redis itself, but rather measure your network (or IPC) latency and the client library intrinsic latency. To really test Redis, you need multiple connections (like redis-benchmark) and/or to use pipelining to aggregate several commands and/or multiple threads or processes.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is an in-memory data store with some optional persistence options. If you plan to compare it to transactional servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc ...), then you should consider activating AOF and decide on a suitable fsync policy.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis is, mostly, a single-threaded server from the POV of commands execution (actually modern versions of Redis use threads for different things). It is not designed to benefit from multiple CPU cores. People are supposed to launch several Redis instances to scale out on several cores if needed. It is not really fair to compare one single Redis instance to a multi-threaded data store.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA common misconception is that redis-benchmark is designed to make Redis\\\\\\\\nperformances look stellar, the throughput achieved by redis-benchmark being\\\\\\\\nsomewhat artificial, and not achievable by a real application. This is\\\\\\\\nactually not true.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe `redis-benchmark` program is a quick and useful way to get some figures and\\\\\\\\nevaluate the performance of a Redis instance on a given hardware. However,\\\\\\\\nby default, it does not represent the maximum throughput a Redis instance can\\\\\\\\nsustain. Actually, by using pipelining and a fast client (hiredis), it is fairly\\\\\\\\neasy to write a program generating more throughput than redis-benchmark. The\\\\\\\\ndefault behavior of redis-benchmark is to achieve throughput by exploiting\\\\\\\\nconcurrency only (i.e. it creates several connections to the server).\\\\\\\\nIt does not use pipelining or any parallelism at all (one pending query per\\\\\\\\nconnection at most, and no multi-threading), if not explicitly enabled via\\\\\\\\nthe `-P` parameter. So in some way using `redis-benchmark` and, triggering, for\\\\\\\\nexample, a `BGSAVE` operation in the background at the same time, will provide\\\\\\\\nthe user with numbers more near to the *worst case* than to the best case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo run a benchmark using pipelining mode (and achieve higher throughput),\\\\\\\\nyou need to explicitly use the -P option. Please note that it is still a\\\\\\\\nrealistic behavior since a lot of Redis based applications actively use\\\\\\\\npipelining to improve performance. However you should use a pipeline size that\\\\\\\\nis more or less the average pipeline length you\\'ll be able to use in your\\\\\\\\napplication in order to get realistic numbers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, the benchmark should apply the same operations, and work in the same way\\\\\\\\nwith the multiple data stores you want to compare. It is absolutely pointless to\\\\\\\\ncompare the result of redis-benchmark to the result of another benchmark\\\\\\\\nprogram and extrapolate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor instance, Redis and memcached in single-threaded mode can be compared on\\\\\\\\nGET/SET operations. Both are in-memory data stores, working mostly in the same\\\\\\\\nway at the protocol level. Provided their respective benchmark application is\\\\\\\\naggregating queries in the same way (pipelining) and use a similar number of\\\\\\\\nconnections, the comparison is actually meaningful.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis perfect example is illustrated by the dialog between Redis (antirez) and\\\\\\\\nmemcached (dormando) developers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 1 - On Redis, Memcached, Speed, Benchmarks and The Toilet](http://antirez.com/post/redis-memcached-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[dormando - Redis VS Memcached (slightly better bench)](http://dormando.livejournal.com/525147.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n[antirez 2 - An update on the Memcached/Redis benchmark](http://antirez.com/post/update-on-memcached-redis-benchmark.html)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can see that in the end, the difference between the two solutions is not\\\\\\\\nso staggering, once all technical aspects are considered. Please note both\\\\\\\\nRedis and memcached have been optimized further after these benchmarks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, when very efficient servers are benchmarked (and stores like Redis\\\\\\\\nor memcached definitely fall in this category), it may be difficult to saturate\\\\\\\\nthe server. Sometimes, the performance bottleneck is on client side,\\\\\\\\nand not server-side. In that case, the client (i.e. the benchmark program itself)\\\\\\\\nmust be fixed, or perhaps scaled out, in order to reach the maximum throughput.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFactors impacting Redis performance\\\\\\\\n-----------------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere are multiple factors having direct consequences on Redis performance.\\\\\\\\nWe mention them here, since they can alter the result of any benchmarks.\\\\\\\\nPlease note however, that a typical Redis instance running on a low end,\\\\\\\\nuntuned box usually provides good enough performance for most applications.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ Network bandwidth and latency usually have a direct impact on the performance.\\\\\\\\nIt is a good practice to use the ping program to quickly check the latency\\\\\\\\nbetween the client and server hosts is normal before launching the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nRegarding the bandwidth, it is generally useful to estimate\\\\\\\\nthe throughput in Gbit/s and compare it to the theoretical bandwidth\\\\\\\\nof the network. For instance a benchmark setting 4 KB strings\\\\\\\\nin Redis at 100000 q/s, would actually consume 3.2 Gbit/s of bandwidth\\\\\\\\nand probably fit within a 10 Gbit/s link, but not a 1 Gbit/s one. In many real\\\\\\\\nworld scenarios, Redis throughput is limited by the network well before being\\\\\\\\nlimited by the CPU. To consolidate several high-throughput Redis instances\\\\\\\\non a single server, it worth considering putting a 10 Gbit/s NIC\\\\\\\\nor multiple 1 Gbit/s NICs with TCP/IP bonding.\\\\\\\\n+ CPU is another very important factor. Being single-threaded, Redis favors\\\\\\\\nfast CPUs with large caches and not many cores. At this game, Intel CPUs are\\\\\\\\ncurrently the winners. It is not uncommon to get only half the performance on\\\\\\\\nan AMD Opteron CPU compared to similar Nehalem EP/Westmere EP/Sandy Bridge\\\\\\\\nIntel CPUs with Redis. When client and server run on the same box, the CPU is\\\\\\\\nthe limiting factor with redis-benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ Speed of RAM and memory bandwidth seem less critical for global performance\\\\\\\\nespecially for small objects. For large objects (>10 KB), it may become\\\\\\\\nnoticeable though. Usually, it is not really cost-effective to buy expensive\\\\\\\\nfast memory modules to optimize Redis.\\\\\\\\n+ Redis runs slower on a VM compared to running without virtualization using\\\\\\\\nthe same hardware. If you have the chance to run Redis on a physical machine\\\\\\\\nthis is preferred. However this does not mean that Redis is slow in\\\\\\\\nvirtualized environments, the delivered performances are still very good\\\\\\\\nand most of the serious performance issues you may incur in virtualized\\\\\\\\nenvironments are due to over-provisioning, non-local disks with high latency,\\\\\\\\nor old hypervisor software that have slow `fork` syscall implementation.\\\\\\\\n+ When the server and client benchmark programs run on the same box, both\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback and unix domain sockets can be used. Depending on the\\\\\\\\nplatform, unix domain sockets can achieve around 50% more throughput than\\\\\\\\nthe TCP/IP loopback (on Linux for instance). The default behavior of\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark is to use the TCP/IP loopback.\\\\\\\\n+ The performance benefit of unix domain sockets compared to TCP/IP loopback\\\\\\\\ntends to decrease when pipelining is heavily used (i.e. long pipelines).\\\\\\\\n+ When an ethernet network is used to access Redis, aggregating commands using\\\\\\\\npipelining is especially efficient when the size of the data is kept under\\\\\\\\nthe ethernet packet size (about 1500 bytes). Actually, processing 10 bytes,\\\\\\\\n100 bytes, or 1000 bytes queries almost result in the same throughput.\\\\\\\\nSee the graph below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![Data size impact](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/client_command/topics/Data_size.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ On multi CPU sockets servers, Redis performance becomes dependent on the\\\\\\\\nNUMA configuration and process location. The most visible effect is that\\\\\\\\nredis-benchmark results seem non-deterministic because client and server\\\\\\\\nprocesses are distributed randomly on the cores. To get deterministic results,\\\\\\\\nit is required to use process placement tools (on Linux: taskset or numactl).\\\\\\\\nThe most efficient combination is always to put the client and server on two\\\\\\\\ndifferent cores of the same CPU to benefit from the L3 cache.\\\\\\\\nHere are some results of 4 KB SET benchmark for 3 server CPUs (AMD Istanbul,\\\\\\\\nIntel Nehalem EX, and Intel Westmere) with different relative placements.\\\\\\\\nPlease note this benchmark is not meant to compare CPU models between themselves\\\\\\\\n(CPUs exact model and frequency are therefore not disclosed).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![NUMA chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/6374a07f93e867353e5e946c1e39a573dfc83f6c/topics/NUMA_chart.gif)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, the number of client connections is also an\\\\\\\\nimportant factor. Being based on epoll/kqueue, the Redis event loop is quite\\\\\\\\nscalable. Redis has already been benchmarked at more than 60000 connections,\\\\\\\\nand was still able to sustain 50000 q/s in these conditions. As a rule of thumb,\\\\\\\\nan instance with 30000 connections can only process half the throughput\\\\\\\\nachievable with 100 connections. Here is an example showing the throughput of\\\\\\\\na Redis instance per number of connections:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n![connections chart](https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/system_info/topics/Connections_chart.png)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ With high-end configurations, it is possible to achieve higher throughput by\\\\\\\\ntuning the NIC(s) configuration and associated interruptions. Best throughput\\\\\\\\nis achieved by setting an affinity between Rx/Tx NIC queues and CPU cores,\\\\\\\\nand activating RPS (Receive Packet Steering) support. More information in this\\\\\\\\n[thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/gUhc19gnYgc/BruTPCOroiMJ).\\\\\\\\nJumbo frames may also provide a performance boost when large objects are used.\\\\\\\\n+ Depending on the platform, Redis can be compiled against different memory\\\\\\\\nallocators (libc malloc, jemalloc, tcmalloc), which may have different behaviors\\\\\\\\nin term of raw speed, internal and external fragmentation.\\\\\\\\nIf you did not compile Redis yourself, you can use the INFO command to check\\\\\\\\nthe `mem_allocator` field. Please note most benchmarks do not run long enough to\\\\\\\\ngenerate significant external fragmentation (contrary to production Redis\\\\\\\\ninstances).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOther things to consider\\\\\\\\n------------------------\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOne important goal of any benchmark is to get reproducible results, so they\\\\\\\\ncan be compared to the results of other tests.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n+ A good practice is to try to run tests on isolated hardware as much as possible.\\\\\\\\nIf it is not possible, then the system must be monitored to check the benchmark\\\\\\\\nis not impacted by some external activity.\\\\\\\\n+ Some configurations (desktops and laptops for sure, some servers as well)\\\\\\\\nhave a variable CPU core frequency mechanism. The policy controlling this\\\\\\\\nmechanism can be set at the OS level. Some CPU models are more aggressive than\\\\\\\\nothers at adapting the frequency of the CPU cores to the workload. To get\\\\\\\\nreproducible results, it is better to set the highest possible fixed frequency\\\\\\\\nfor all the CPU cores involved in the benchmark.\\\\\\\\n+ An important point is to size the system accordingly to the benchmark.\\\\\\\\nThe system must have enough RAM and must not swap. On Linux, do not forget\\\\\\\\nto set the `overcommit_memory` parameter correctly. Please note 32 and 64 bit\\\\\\\\nRedis instances do not have the same memory footprint.\\\\\\\\n+ If you plan to use RDB or AOF for your benchmark, please check there is no other\\\\\\\\nI/O activity in the system. Avoid putting RDB or AOF files on NAS or NFS shares,\\\\\\\\nor on any other devices impacting your network bandwidth and/or latency\\\\\\\\n(for instance, EBS on Amazon EC2).\\\\\\\\n+ Set Redis logging level (loglevel parameter) to warning or notice. Avoid putting\\\\\\\\nthe generated log file on a remote filesystem.\\\\\\\\n+ Avoid using monitoring tools which can alter the result of the benchmark. For\\\\\\\\ninstance using INFO at regular interval to gather statistics is probably fine,\\\\\\\\nbut MONITOR will impact the measured performance significantly.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 3.5715,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a6d3756f-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/arm.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"ARM support\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Performance testing of Redis was performed on the Raspberry Pi 3 and Pi 1 model B.

This setup requires no external API dependencies and runs entirely on your machine.\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\n\nInstall the required tools:\n- **Ollama** - for running Llama models locally\n- **Qdrant** - vector database (via Docker)\n- **Python 3.8+**\n\n### 2. Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 3. Set Up Vector Database\n\n```bash\n# Pull and run Qdrant\ndocker pull qdrant/qdrant\ndocker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant\n```\n\n### 4. Install Llama Models\n\n```bash\n# Pull Llama 3.2 for LLM\nollama pull llama3.2\n\n# Pull OpenHermes for embeddings\nollama pull openhermes\n```\n\n### 5. Run the Application\n\n```bash\npython local_rag_agent.py\n```\n\nAccess the web interface at `http://localhost:7777` through the AgentOS interface.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Fully local implementation** - no external API calls\n- **Vector search** using Qdrant for semantic retrieval\n- **Interactive web UI** via AgentOS\n- **Document management** using Agno v2.0 Knowledge class\n- **PDF support** - loads documents (e.g., Thai Recipes PDF) on first run\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Documents are loaded and chunked\n2. Embeddings are generated using OpenHermes\n3. Vectors are stored in Qdrant\n4. User queries are embedded and searched\n5. Llama 3.2 generates answers based on retrieved context\n\n## Note\n\nAfter the first run, you can comment out the `knowledge_base.add_content()` line to avoid reloading the same documents.\n\n---\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/local_rag_agent/README.md > 🦙 Local RAG Agent with Llama 3.2 > Note]**\n\nFor a complete step-by-step

Unlike traditional RAG systems that simply retrieve and generate, Corrective RAG adds quality control and fallback mechanisms.\n\n## How It Improves Retrieval Quality\n\nCorrective RAG enhances retrieval through several key mechanisms:\n\n1. **Document Relevance Grading**: Uses an LLM (Claude 4.5 Sonnet) to assess whether retrieved documents are actually relevant to the query, filtering out low-quality results.\n\n2. **Query Transformation**: When initial retrieval results are insufficient, the system optimizes and reformulates the query to improve search results.\n\n3. **Web Search Fallback**: If local documents aren't sufficient or relevant enough, the system automatically falls back to web search (via Tavily API) to find additional information.\n\n4. **Multi-Stage Workflow**: Combines document retrieval, relevance assessment, query optimization, and web search in a coordinated workflow managed by LangGraph.\n\n5. **Multi-Model Approach**: Uses different models for different tasks (OpenAI for embeddings, Claude for analysis and generation) to leverage each model's strengths.\n\nThis corrective approach addresses a common RAG problem: sometimes the retrieved documents aren't actually relevant or complete enough to answer the question. By adding grading and fallback mechanisms, Corrective RAG significantly improves answer quality and reliability.\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md > 🔄 Corrective RAG Agent]", "tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["docs/design-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md"], "contexts_count": 1, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["RAG", "local", "corrective", "retrieval"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["docs/design-review.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "a059a203-bc05-44c2-8506-b849539f60b7", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "07a71082-ffd9-4d52-b4cf-144a1c30b6b9", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about Corrective RAG and how it improves retrieval quality.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_thnGd1sUM1kw01W2USJlAf', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'Corrective RAG retrieval quality improvement', 'top_k': 5})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_thnGd1sUM1kw01W2USJlAf', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.6467,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"737a4dbf\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"737a4dbf-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/corrective_rag/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"🔄 Corrective RAG Agent\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"🔄 Corrective RAG Agent\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that implements a corrective multi-stage workflow using LangGraph.

Quick Start: 30-Line Python Implementation\n\nThe simplest approach uses **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** with just 30 lines of Python code:\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Clone the repository:**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd awesome-llm-apps/chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_pdf\n```\n\n2. **Install dependencies:**\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n3. **Get OpenAI API key** from [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/)\n\n4. **Run the app:**\n```bash\nstreamlit run chat_pdf.py\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Upload PDF documents\n- Ask questions about the content\n- Get accurate answers using RAG and LLM\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/chat_with_pdf/README.md > Interactive Application Demo]\n\n---\n\n## Advanced Options\n\n### 1. **Voice-Enabled RAG** (with text-to-speech)\n- Supports PDF processing and chunking\n- Uses Qdrant vector database\n- Real-time text-to-speech with multiple voice options\n- Audio download capability\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/voice_rag_openaisdk/README.md]\n\n### 2. **Hybrid Search RAG** (better accuracy)\n- Combines semantic and keyword matching\n- Uses reranking for better context selection\n- Multi-model integration (Claude + OpenAI embeddings + Cohere reranker)\n- PostgreSQL/SQLite backend\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/hybrid_search_rag/README.md]\n\n### 3. **Autonomous RAG** (with web search fallback)\n- PDF upload and processing\n- Knowledge base integration with PostgreSQL + Pgvector\n- Web search capability using DuckDuckGo\n- Persistent storage of conversations\n\n[来源: awesome-llm-apps/autonomous_rag/README.md]\n\n---\n\n## Core Architecture\n\nAll implementations follow this pattern:\n\n1. **Document Processing:** Split PDFs into chunks using text splitters\n2. **Embedding:** Convert chunks to vectors using embedding models\n3. **Storage:** Store vectors in a database (Qdrant, Pgvector, SQLite)\n4. **Query Processing:** Convert user questions to embeddings\n5. **Retrieval:** Find similar document chunks via similarity search\n6. **Generation:** Use LLM to generate answers based on retrieved context\n\n**Tutorial:** [Complete

It combines visual embedding models with vision-capable language models.\n\n### How Vision RAG Works\n\n**Two-Stage Process:**\n\n1. **Retrieval Stage (Visual Search)**\n   - Images and PDF pages are converted to base64 strings\n   - A multimodal embedding model (like Cohere Embed-4) generates dense vector embeddings for each image\n   - When you ask a text question, it's embedded using the same model\n   - Cosine similarity finds the most relevant image/page for your question\n\n2. **Generation Stage (Visual Question Answering)**\n   - The retrieved image and your question are sent to a vision-capable LLM (like Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)\n   - The model analyzes the image content and generates a contextual answer\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **No OCR Required**: Directly processes complex images, charts, diagrams, and PDF pages without separate text extraction\n- **Multimodal Embedding**: Uses models like Cohere Embed-4 that can embed both text queries and visual content in the same vector space\n- **PDF Support**: Automatically extracts PDF pages as images for analysis\n- **Flexible Content**: Works with charts, infographics, diagrams, flowcharts, tables, and screenshots\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Analyze financial charts and extract trends\n- Answer questions about diagrams and flowcharts\n- Extract information from tables in images/PDFs\n- Query visual knowledge bases using natural language\n- Understand multi-page visual reports\n\n### Technical Stack Example\n\n- **Embedding**: Cohere Embed-4 (multimodal)\n- **Generation**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (vision-capable)\n- **Processing**: PyMuPDF for PDF page rendering\n\n[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/vision_rag/README.md > Vision RAG with Cohere Embed-4 🖼️]", "tools_used":

 - Regular images are converted to base64 strings.\\\\\\\\n        - **PDFs are processed page by page**: Each page is rendered as an image, saved temporarily, and converted to a base64 string.\\\\\\\\n    - Cohere\\'s `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_document\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`) is used to generate a dense vector embedding for each image or PDF page image.\\\\\\\\n    - When you ask a question, the text query is embedded using the same `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_query\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`).\\\\\\\\n    - Cosine similarity is calculated between the question embedding and all image embeddings.\\\\\\\\n    - The image with the highest similarity score (which could be a regular image or a specific PDF page image) is retrieved as the most relevant context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Generation**:\\\\\\\\n    - The original text question and the retrieved image/page image are passed as input to the Google

Redis for RAG\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To build a RAG application with Redis, follow these general steps:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Set up Redis**: Start by setting up a Redis instance and configuring it to handle vector data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Use a Framework**:\\\\\\\\n    1. **Redis Vector Library (RedisVL)**: [RedisVL](https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redisvl/) enhances the development of generative AI applications by efficiently managing vectors and metadata. It allows for storage of vector embeddings and facilitates fast similarity searches, crucial for retrieving relevant information in RAG.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Popular AI frameworks**: Redis integrates seamlessly with various AI frameworks and tools. For instance, combining Redis with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis/) or [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/vector_stores/RedisIndexDemo/), libraries for building language models, enables developers to create sophisticated RAG pipelines. These integrations support efficient data management and building real-time LLM chains.\\\\\\\\n    1. **Spring AI and Redis**: Using [Spring AI with Redis](https://redis.io/blog/building-a-rag-application-with-redis-and-spring-ai/) simplifies building RAG applications. Spring AI provides a structured approach to integrating AI capabilities into applications, while Redis handles data management, ensuring the RAG pipeline is efficient and scalable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Embed and store data**: Convert your data into vector embeddings using a suitable model (e.g., BERT, GPT). Store these embeddings in Redis, where they can be quickly retrieved based on vector searches.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Integrate with a generative model**: Use a generative AI model that can leverage the retrieved data. The model will use the vectors stored in Redis to augment its generation process, ensuring the output is informed by relevant, up-to-date information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Query and generate**: Implement the query logic to retrieve relevant vectors from Redis based on the input prompt. Feed these vectors into the generative model to produce augmented outputs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Efficiency**: The in-memory data store of Redis ensures that retrieval operations are performed with minimal latency.\\\\\\\\n- **Scalability**: Redis scales horizontally, seamlessly handling growing volumes of data and queries.\\\\\\\\n- **Flexibility**: Redis supports a variety of data structures and integrates with AI frameworks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, Redis offers a powerful and efficient platform for implementing RAG. Its vector management capabilities, high performance, and seamless integration with AI frameworks make it an ideal choice for enhancing generative AI applications with real-time data retrieval.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.329,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3c75fde5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3c75fde5-000\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/rag_agent_cohere/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG Agent with Cohere ⌘R\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG Agent with Cohere ⌘R\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"A RAG Agentic system built with Cohere\\'s new model Command-r7b-12-2024, Qdrant for vector storage, Langchain for RAG and LangGraph for orchestration.

Use pre-loaded sample financial charts and infographics.\\\\\\\\n    - Upload your own custom images (PNG, JPG, JPEG).\\\\\\\\n    - **Upload PDF documents**: Automatically extracts pages as images for analysis.\\\\\\\\n- **No OCR Required**: Directly processes complex images and visual elements within PDF pages without needing separate text extraction steps.\\\\\\\\n- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction, including content loading, question input, and result display.\\\\\\\\n- **Session Management**: Remembers loaded/uploaded content (images and processed PDF pages) within a session.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Python 3.8+\\\\\\\\n- Cohere API key\\\\\\\\n- Google Gemini API key\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFollow these steps to set up and run the application:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Clone and Navigate to Directory** :\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\\\\\\\\n    cd awesome-llm-apps/rag_tutorials/vision_rag\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Install Dependencies**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n    *(Ensure you have the latest `PyMuPDF` installed along with other requirements)*\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3.  **Set up your API keys**:\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Cohere API key from: [https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)\\\\\\\\n    - Get a Google API key from: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4.  **Run the Streamlit app**:\\\\\\\\n    ```bash\\\\\\\\n    streamlit run vision_rag.py\\\\\\\\n    ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5.  **Access the Web Interface**:\\\\\\\\n    - Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your terminal.\\\\\\\\n    - Open this URL in your web browser.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe application follows a two-stage RAG process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Retrieval**: \\\\\\\\n    - When you load sample images or upload your own images/PDFs:\\\\\\\\n        - Regular images are converted to base64 strings.\\\\\\\\n        - **PDFs are processed page by page**: Each page is rendered as an image, saved temporarily, and converted to a base64 string.\\\\\\\\n    - Cohere\\'s `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_document\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`) is used to generate a dense vector embedding for each image or PDF page image.\\\\\\\\n    - When you ask a question, the text query is embedded using the same `embed-v4.0` model (with `input_type=\\\\\\\\\\\\\"search_query\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`).\\\\\\\\n    - Cosine similarity is calculated between the question embedding and all image embeddings.\\\\\\\\n    - The image with the highest similarity score (which could be a regular image or a specific PDF page image) is retrieved as the most relevant context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Generation**:\\\\\\\\n    - The original text question and the retrieved image/page image are passed as input to the Google `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model.\\\\\\\\n    - Gemini analyzes the image content in the context of the question and generates a textual answer.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_rxy7fvEK43RqstSsW7TJkd', content='No files found', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"Found a detailed tutorial on building a RAG app with Cohere Command R!

Install dependencies (typically `mem0`, `qdrant-client`, LLM SDK)\n2. Configure Qdrant connection (default: localhost:6333)\n3. Initialize memory client with vector store backend\n4. Implement memory retrieval before LLM calls\n5.

Here's how to build it:\n\n### Architecture: 4 Specialized Teaching Agents\n\nThe system uses a **team-based approach** where each agent has a specialized educational role:\n\n1. **🧠 Professor Agent** - Content Creator\n   - Creates fundamental knowledge base in Google Docs\n   - Organizes content with proper headings and sections\n   - Includes detailed explanations and examples\n   - Output: Comprehensive knowledge base document with table of contents\n\n2. **🗺️ Academic Advisor Agent** - Learning Path Designer\n   - Designs structured learning paths in Google Docs\n   - Creates progressive milestone markers\n   - Includes time estimates and prerequisites\n   - Output: Visual roadmap document with clear progression paths\n\n3. **📚 Research Librarian Agent** - Resource Curator\n   - Compiles organized resources in Google Docs\n   - Includes links to academic papers and tutorials\n   - Adds descriptions and difficulty levels\n   - Output: Categorized resource list with quality ratings\n\n4. **✍️ Teaching Assistant Agent** - Practice Developer\n   - Develops interactive exercises in Google Docs\n   - Creates structured practice sections\n   - Includes solution guides\n   - Output: Complete practice workbook with answers\n\n### Key Technical Components\n\n- **Framework**: Built with Streamlit for the UI\n- **LLM**: OpenAI API for agent intelligence\n- **Integration**: Composio API for Google Docs collaboration (agents write directly to Google Docs)\n- **Search**: SerpAPI for finding educational resources\n\n### Setup Requirements\n\n1. OpenAI API key (for agent reasoning)\n2. Composio API key + Google Docs OAuth2 connection\n3. SerpAPI key (for web search)\n\n### How It Works\n\nUsers enter a topic → agents collaborate to generate a complete learning plan → each agent creates specialized documents in Google Docs → results are viewable through the Streamlit interface.\n\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_teaching_agent_team/README.md]**\n\nA complete step-by-step tutorial is available at the source repository.", "tools_used": ["Read", "Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_finance_agent_team/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/ai_agent_framework_crash_course/openai_sdk_crash_course/9_multi_agent_orchestration/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_teaching_agent_team/README.md"], "contexts_count": 3, "has_citation": true, "correct_doc": true, "matched_keywords": ["agent", "team", "document", "intelligence", "web", "teaching", "education"], "gate_passed": true, "gate_checks": {"tools_used": ["Read", "Grep", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search"], "has_contexts": true, "expected_doc_hit": true, "retrieved_paths": ["/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_finance_agent_team/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/ai_agent_framework_crash_course/openai_sdk_crash_course/9_multi_agent_orchestration/README.md", "/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_teaching_agent_team/README.md"], "has_citation": true}, "failure_reasons": [], "messages": [{"subtype": "init", "data": {"type": "system", "subtype": "init", "cwd": "/home/shenzt/ws/knowledge-base-search", "session_id": "a09a1197-d6f1-486e-8e57-03bafe57ace0", "tools": ["Task", "TaskOutput", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "ExitPlanMode", "Read", "Edit", "Write", "NotebookEdit", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite", "WebSearch", "TaskStop", "AskUserQuestion", "Skill", "EnterPlanMode", "ToolSearch", "mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__keyword_search", "mcp__knowledge-base__index_status", "ListMcpResourcesTool", "ReadMcpResourceTool"], "mcp_servers": [{"name": "knowledge-base", "status": "connected"}], "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "permissionMode": "bypassPermissions", "slash_commands": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "eval", "review", "index-docs", "run-rag-task", "convert-html", "compact", "context", "cost", "init", "pr-comments", "release-notes", "review", "security-review", "insights"], "apiKeySource": "none", "claude_code_version": "2.1.39", "output_style": "default", "agents": ["Bash", "general-purpose", "statusline-setup", "Explore", "Plan"], "skills": ["debug", "build-index", "search", "ingest-repo", "search-hierarchical", "sync-from-raw", "update-index", "ingest", "review", "index-docs", "convert-html"], "plugins": [], "uuid": "62e60e28-f669-4515-bac5-30bf364f5ced", "fast_mode_state": "off"}}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text=\"I'll search the knowledge base for information about building AI teaching agent teams for education.\")]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_jmyHEOSUMENKf21t9AGwon', name='mcp__knowledge-base__hybrid_search', input={'query': 'AI teaching agent team education multi-agent system', 'top_k': 10})]"}, {"content": "[ToolUseBlock(id='tooluse_BX84z3jxn8rc7xTdzY6Aby', name='Grep', input={'-i': True, 'path': 'docs', 'pattern': 'teaching.*agent|education.*agent|multi.*agent.*team'})]"}, {"content": "[ToolResultBlock(tool_use_id='tooluse_jmyHEOSUMENKf21t9AGwon', content='{\"result\":\"[\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.4739,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"73cde3ed\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"73cde3ed-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/awesome-llm-apps/advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_finance_agent_team/README.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Readme\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"💲 AI Finance Agent Team with Web Access > How to get Started?\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- Multi-agent system with specialized roles:\\\\\\\\n    - Web Agent for general internet research\\\\\\\\n    - Finance Agent for detailed financial analysis\\\\\\\\n    - Team Agent for coordinating between agents\\\\\\\\n- Real-time financial data access through YFinance\\\\\\\\n- Web search capabilities using DuckDuckGo\\\\\\\\n- Persistent storage of agent interactions using SQLite\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

The knowledge base contains several practical implementations.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**\nUse specialized agents working together:\n- **Vision Agent**: Processes images/video using models like Gemini 2.0 Flash\n- **Analysis Agent**: Performs domain-specific analysis (UX, coding, content)\n- **Execution/Output Agent**: Generates results or executes code\n- **Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates the workflow between agents\n\n### 2. **Technology Stack**\n- **AI Models**: Google Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash or Pro (multimodal capabilities)\n- **Framework**: Phidata or Google ADK for agent orchestration\n- **Frontend**: Streamlit for user interface\n- **Additional Tools**: \n  - DuckDuckGo Search API for web research\n  - E2B Sandbox for code execution\n  - Pillow for image processing\n\n### 3. **Implementation Steps**\n\n**Setup Environment:**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\ncd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/multimodal_design_agent_team\n\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**Get API Keys:**\n- Google Gemini API: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n- (Optional) OpenAI API for additional models\n- (Optional) E2B API for code execution: https://e2b.dev/docs/getting-started/api-key\n\n**Configure the Agent:**\n```bash\nexport GOOGLE_API_KEY=\"your_api_key\"\n```\n\n**Run the Application:**\n```bash\nstreamlit run multimodal_agent.py\n```\n\n### 4. **Design Patterns**\n\n**Coordinator/Dispatcher Pattern:**\n- One coordinator agent manages multiple specialized agents\n- Agents work sequentially or in parallel\n- Each agent has a specific role (visual analysis, UX evaluation, market research)\n\n**Sequential Pipeline:**\n- Data flows through agents in order\n- Each agent enriches the analysis\n- Final agent synthesizes all insights\n\n### 5. **Best Practices**\n\n- Upload **high-resolution images** for better analysis\n- Provide **context** about your use case and target audience\n- Use **multiple views/screens** for comprehensive analysis\n- Support common formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, MP4, MOV, AVI\n- Implement **real-time processing** with progress indicators\n- Add **error handling** and execution timeouts (e.g., 30 seconds)\n\n### 6. **Example Use Cases**\n\nThe knowledge base shows multimodal agents for:\n- **Design Analysis**: UI/UX feedback, visual design evaluation\n- **Coding Assistant**: Analyze code screenshots, generate solutions\n- **Speech Training**: Analyze video/audio for presentation feedback\n- **Home Renovation**: Analyze room photos, generate design plans\n\n[来源:

It depicts the potential of Agno as a team of collaborative agents working together seamlessly in order to address a real-world challenge - analyzing speech presentations by users and providing them with comprehensive evaluation and feedback to improve their public speaking skills. Each individual agent has a clear cut goal to follow and together they coordinate as a team to solve a complex multimodal problem.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- This project has a huge potential for further enhancements. It could be a starting point for a more comprehensive and useful agentic systsem. Some of the proposed additional functionalities could be:\\\\\\\\n  1. Incorporating real-time video recording and conversational capabilities through different role scenarios.\\\\\\\\n  2. Playing back the user speech through an AI avatar to help users learn and understand best speaking practices.\\\\\\\\n  3. Keeping a record of user sessions.\\\\\\\\n  4. Including a performance dashboard to track user performance over time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   Each of these additional functionalities could be added by implementing specific goal-oriented agents in the system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Together API** with **meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free** as LLM has a small token limit, therefore, it works with small video clips (15-30 seconds).\\\\\\\\n- Use other LLM options for longer video clips.

Here's what the knowledge base contains:\n\n## Overview\n\nAn AI Services Agency is a multi-agent system that simulates a full-service digital agency using specialized AI agents to analyze and plan software projects. Each agent represents a different role in the project lifecycle, from strategic planning to technical implementation.\n\n## Agent Roles & Responsibilities\n\nThe agency consists of five specialized agents:\n\n1. **CEO Agent** - Strategic leader and final decision maker\n   - Analyzes startup ideas using structured evaluation\n   - Makes strategic decisions across product, technical, marketing, and financial domains\n   - Uses AnalyzeProjectRequirements tool\n\n2. **CTO Agent** - Technical architecture and feasibility expert\n   - Evaluates technical requirements and feasibility\n   - Provides architecture decisions\n   - Uses CreateTechnicalSpecification tool\n\n3. **Product Manager Agent** - Product strategy specialist\n   - Defines product strategy and roadmap\n   - Coordinates between technical and marketing teams\n   - Focuses on product-market fit\n\n4. **Developer Agent** - Technical implementation expert\n   - Provides detailed technical implementation guidance\n   - Suggests optimal tech stack and cloud solutions\n   - Estimates development costs and timelines\n\n5. **Client Success Agent** - Marketing strategy leader\n   - Develops go-to-market strategies\n   - Plans customer acquisition approaches\n   - Coordinates with product team\n\n## Agent Communication Flows\n\nThe agents coordinate through explicit communication patterns:\n- **CEO ↔️ All Agents**: Strategic oversight\n- **CTO ↔️ Developer**: Technical implementation collaboration\n- **Product Manager ↔️ Client Success**: Go-to-market strategy coordination\n- **Product Manager ↔️ Developer**: Feature implementation planning\n\n## How to Build It\n\n1. **Clone the repository**:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps.git\n   cd advanced_ai_agents/multi_agent_apps/agent_teams/ai_services_agency\n   ```\n\n2. **Install dependencies**:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Get OpenAI API Key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\n\n4. **Run the Streamlit app**:\n   ```bash\n   streamlit run agency.py\n   ```\n\n5. **Enter your OpenAI API Key** in the sidebar and start analyzing your startup idea\n\n## Specialized Tools\n\nThe agency uses tools built with OpenAI Schema for structured analysis:\n- **AnalyzeProjectRequirements**: For market evaluation and startup idea analysis\n- **CreateTechnicalSpecification**: For technical assessment\n\nEach analysis is returned in a dedicated section in the Streamlit UI.\n\n[来源:

Common reasons for that could be:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Starting Redis in a new environment\\\\\\\\n* Re-starting an ephemeral (cache-only) Redis, that uses functions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn such cases, we need to make sure that the pre-loaded functions are available before Redis accepts inbound user connections and commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo do that, it is possible to use `redis-cli --functions-rdb` to extract the functions from an existing server. This generates an RDB file that can be loaded by Redis at startup.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis needs to have some information about how a function is going to behave when executed, in order to properly enforce resource usage policies and maintain data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, Redis needs to know that a certain function is read-only before permitting it to execute using [`FCALL_RO`]() on a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all functions may perform arbitrary read or write operations. Function Flags make it possible to declare more specific function behavior at the time of registration. Let\\'s see how this works.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn our previous example, we defined two functions that only read data. We can try executing them using [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis > FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n(error) ERR Can not execute a function with write flag using fcall_ro.\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRedis returns this error because a function can, in theory, perform both read and write operations on the database.\\\\\\\\nAs a safeguard and by default, Redis assumes that the function does both, so it blocks its execution.\\\\\\\\nThe server will reply with this error in the following cases:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. Executing a function with [`FCALL`]() against a read-only replica.\\\\\\\\n2. Using [`FCALL_RO`]() to execute a function.\\\\\\\\n3. A disk error was detected (Redis is unable to persist so it rejects writes).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn these cases, you can add the `no-writes` flag to the function\\'s registration, disable the safeguard and allow them to run.\\\\\\\\nTo register a function with flags use the [named arguments]() variant of `redis.register_function`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe updated registration code snippet from the library looks like this:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```lua\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function(\\'my_hset\\', my_hset)\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hgetall\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hgetall,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\nredis.register_function{\\\\\\\\n  function_name=\\'my_hlastmodified\\',\\\\\\\\n  callback=my_hlastmodified,\\\\\\\\n  flags={ \\'no-writes\\' }\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOnce we\\'ve replaced the library, Redis allows running both `my_hgetall` and `my_hlastmodified` with [`FCALL_RO`]() against a read-only replica:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hgetall 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"myfield\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"some value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n3) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_field\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n4) \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another value\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nredis> FCALL_RO my_hlastmodified 1 myhash\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1640772721\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor the complete documentation flags, please refer to [Script flags]().\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.9379,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"58f11147-006\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/replication.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis replication\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Read-only replica\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Since Redis 2.6, replicas support a read-only mode that is enabled by default.\\\\\\\\nThis behavior is controlled by the `replica-read-only` option in the redis.conf file, and can be enabled and disabled at runtime using [`CONFIG SET`](/commands/config-set).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRead-only replicas will reject all write commands, so that it is not possible to write to a replica because of a mistake. This does not mean that the feature is intended to expose a replica instance to the internet or more generally to a network where untrusted clients exist, because administrative commands like [`DEBUG`](/commands/debug) or [`CONFIG`](/commands/config) are still enabled. The [Security]() page describes how to secure a Redis instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou may wonder why it is possible to revert the read-only setting\\\\\\\\nand have replica instances that can be targeted by write operations.\\\\\\\\nThe answer is that writable replicas exist only for historical reasons.\\\\\\\\nUsing writable replicas can result in inconsistency between the master and the replica, so it is not recommended to use writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nTo understand in which situations this can be a problem, we need to understand how replication works.\\\\\\\\nChanges on the master is replicated by propagating regular Redis commands to the replica.\\\\\\\\nWhen a key expires on the master, this is propagated as a DEL command.\\\\\\\\nIf a key which exists on the master but is deleted, expired or has a different type on the replica compared to the master will react differently to commands like DEL, INCR or RPOP propagated from the master than intended.\\\\\\\\nThe propagated command may fail on the replica or result in a different outcome.\\\\\\\\nTo minimize the risks (if you insist on using writable replicas) we suggest you follow these recommendations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t write to keys in a writable replica that are also used on the master.\\\\\\\\n  (This can be hard to guarantee if you don\\'t have control over all the clients that write to the master.)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica as an intermediary step when upgrading a set of instances in a running system.\\\\\\\\n  In general, don\\'t configure an instance as a writable replica if it can ever be promoted to a master if you want to guarantee data consistency.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHistorically, there were some use cases that were considered legitimate for writable replicas.\\\\\\\\nAs of version 7.0, these use cases are now all obsolete and the same can be achieved by other means.\\\\\\\\nFor example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Computing slow Set or Sorted set operations and storing the result in temporary local keys using commands like [`SUNIONSTORE`](/commands/sunionstore) and [`ZINTERSTORE`](/commands/zinterstore).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use commands that return the result without storing it, such as [`SUNION`](/commands/sunion) and [`ZINTER`](/commands/zinter).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using the [`SORT`](/commands/sort) command (which is not considered a read-only command because of the optional STORE option and therefore cannot be used on a read-only replica).\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`SORT_RO`](/commands/sort_ro), which is a read-only command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Using [`EVAL`](/commands/eval) and [`EVALSHA`](/commands/evalsha) are also not considered read-only commands, because the Lua script may call write commands.\\\\\\\\n  Instead, use [`EVAL_RO`](/commands/eval_ro) and [`EVALSHA_RO`](/commands/evalsha_ro) where the Lua script can only call read-only commands.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile writes to a replica will be discarded if the replica and the master resync or if the replica is restarted, there is no guarantee that they will sync automatically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBefore version 4.0, writable replicas were incapable of expiring keys with a time to live set.\\\\\\\\nThis means that if you use [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) or other commands that set a maximum TTL for a key, the key will leak, and while you may no longer see it while accessing it with read commands, you will see it in the count of keys and it will still use memory.\\\\\\\\nRedis 4.0 RC3 and greater versions are able to evict keys with TTL as masters do, with the exceptions of keys written in DB numbers greater than 63 (but by default Redis instances only have 16 databases).\\\\\\\\nNote though that even in versions greater than 4.0, using [`EXPIRE`](/commands/expire) on a key that could ever exists on the master can cause inconsistency between the replica and the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note that since Redis 4.0 replica writes are only local, and are not propagated to sub-replicas attached to the instance. Sub-replicas instead will always receive the replication stream identical to the one sent by the top-level master to the intermediate replicas. So for example in the following setup:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    A ---> B ---> C\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven if `B` is writable, C will not see `B` writes and will instead have identical dataset as the master instance `A`.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 0.3325,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a9efc34c-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/programmability/lua-api.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis Lua API reference\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"_redis_ object {#redis_object} > `redis.register_function` {#redis.register_function} > Script flags {#script_flags}\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"**Important:**\\\\\\\\nUse script flags with care, which may negatively impact if misused.\\\\\\\\nNote that the default for Eval scripts are different than the default for functions that are mentioned below, see [Eval Flags]()\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhen you register a function or load an Eval script, the server does not know how it accesses the database.\\\\\\\\nBy default, Redis assumes that all scripts read and write data.\\\\\\\\nThis results in the following behavior:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.

The following is the list of its subcommands (minimal version is noted for where applicable):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG GET `<name>`** (`>= 6.2`) Get the current value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter. The specified name may be a wildcard, similar to the Redis [`CONFIG GET`](/commands/config-get) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CONFIG SET `<name>` `<value>`** (`>= 6.2`) Set the value of a global Sentinel configuration parameter.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL CKQUORUM `<master name>`** Check if the current Sentinel configuration is able to reach the quorum needed to failover a master, and the majority needed to authorize the failover. This command should be used in monitoring systems to check if a Sentinel deployment is ok.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FLUSHCONFIG** Force Sentinel to rewrite its configuration on disk, including the current Sentinel state. Normally Sentinel rewrites the configuration every time something changes in its state (in the context of the subset of the state which is persisted on disk across restart). However sometimes it is possible that the configuration file is lost because of operation errors, disk failures, package upgrade scripts or configuration managers. In those cases a way to force Sentinel to rewrite the configuration file is handy. This command works even if the previous configuration file is completely missing.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL FAILOVER `<master name>`** Force a failover as if the master was not reachable, and without asking for agreement to other Sentinels (however a new version of the configuration will be published so that the other Sentinels will update their configurations).\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL GET-MASTER-ADDR-BY-NAME `<master name>`** Return the ip and port number of the master with that name. If a failover is in progress or terminated successfully for this master it returns the address and port of the promoted replica.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL INFO-CACHE** (`>= 3.2`) Return cached [`INFO`](/commands/info) output from masters and replicas.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR <ip> <port> <current-epoch> <runid>** Check if the master specified by ip:port is down from current Sentinel\\'s point of view. This command is mostly for internal use.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTER `<master name>`** Show the state and info of the specified master.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MASTERS** Show a list of monitored masters and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MONITOR** Start Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL MYID** (`>= 6.2`) Return the ID of the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL PENDING-SCRIPTS** This command returns information about pending scripts.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REMOVE** Stop Sentinel\\'s monitoring. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL REPLICAS `<master name>`** (`>= 5.0`) Show a list of replicas for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SENTINELS `<master name>`** Show a list of sentinel instances for this master, and their state.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SET** Set Sentinel\\'s monitoring configuration. Refer to the [_Reconfiguring Sentinel at Runtime_ section](#reconfiguring-sentinel-at-runtime) for more information.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL SIMULATE-FAILURE (crash-after-election|crash-after-promotion|help)** (`>= 3.2`) This command simulates different Sentinel crash scenarios.\\\\\\\\n* **SENTINEL RESET `<pattern>`** This command will reset all the masters with matching name. The pattern argument is a glob-style pattern. The reset process clears any previous state in a master (including a failover in progress), and removes every replica and sentinel already discovered and associated with the master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor connection management and administration purposes, Sentinel supports the following subset of Redis\\' commands:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **ACL** (`>= 6.2`) This command manages the Sentinel Access Control List. For more information refer to the [ACL]() documentation page and the [_Sentinel Access Control List authentication_](#sentinel-access-control-list-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **AUTH** (`>= 5.0.1`) Authenticate a client connection. For more information refer to the [`AUTH`](/commands/auth) command and the [_Configuring Sentinel instances with authentication_ section](#configuring-sentinel-instances-with-authentication).\\\\\\\\n* **CLIENT** This command manages client connections. For more information refer to its subcommands\\' pages.\\\\\\\\n* **COMMAND** (`>= 6.2`) This command returns information about commands. For more information refer to the [`COMMAND`](/commands/command) command and its various subcommands.\\\\\\\\n* **HELLO** (`>= 6.0`) Switch the connection\\'s protocol. For more information refer to the [`HELLO`](/commands/hello) command.\\\\\\\\n* **INFO** Return information and statistics about the Sentinel server. For more information see the [`INFO`](/commands/info) command.\\\\\\\\n* **PING** This command simply returns PONG.\\\\\\\\n* **ROLE** This command returns the string \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sentinel\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a list of monitored masters. For more information refer to the [`ROLE`](/commands/role) command.\\\\\\\\n* **SHUTDOWN** Shut down the Sentinel instance.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLastly, Sentinel also supports the [`SUBSCRIBE`](/commands/subscribe), [`UNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/unsubscribe), [`PSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/psubscribe) and [`PUNSUBSCRIBE`](/commands/punsubscribe) commands. Refer to the [_Pub/Sub Messages_ section](#pubsub-messages) for more details.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.7454,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"a2f680a5-011\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"High availability with Redis Sentinel\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"A quick tutorial > Testing the failover\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"At this point our toy Sentinel deployment is ready to be tested.

For example, to upgrade the Redis process of one of the\\\\\\\\nmaster nodes it is a good idea to failover it to turn it into a replica\\\\\\\\nwith minimal impact on availability.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are supported by Redis Cluster using the [`CLUSTER FAILOVER`](/commands/cluster-failover)\\\\\\\\ncommand, that must be executed in one of the replicas of the master you want\\\\\\\\nto failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManual failovers are special and are safer compared to failovers resulting from\\\\\\\\nactual master failures. They occur in a way that avoids data loss in the\\\\\\\\nprocess, by switching clients from the original master to the new master only\\\\\\\\nwhen the system is sure that the new master processed all the replication stream\\\\\\\\nfrom the old one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is what you see in the replica log when you perform a manual failover:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Manual failover user request accepted.\\\\\\\\n    # Received replication offset for paused master manual failover: 347540\\\\\\\\n    # All master replication stream processed, manual failover can start.\\\\\\\\n    # Start of election delayed for 0 milliseconds (rank #0, offset 347540).\\\\\\\\n    # Starting a failover election for epoch 7545.\\\\\\\\n    # Failover election won: I\\'m the new master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBasically clients connected to the master we are failing over are stopped.\\\\\\\\nAt the same time the master sends its replication offset to the replica, that\\\\\\\\nwaits to reach the offset on its side.

Another is called *Objectively Down*\\\\\\\\ncondition (ODOWN) and is reached when enough Sentinels (at least the\\\\\\\\nnumber configured as the `quorum` parameter of the monitored master) have\\\\\\\\nan SDOWN condition, and get feedback from other Sentinels using\\\\\\\\nthe `SENTINEL is-master-down-by-addr` command.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the point of view of a Sentinel an SDOWN condition is reached when it\\\\\\\\ndoes not receive a valid reply to PING requests for the number of seconds\\\\\\\\nspecified in the configuration as `is-master-down-after-milliseconds`\\\\\\\\nparameter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAn acceptable reply to PING is one of the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with +PONG.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -LOADING error.\\\\\\\\n* PING replied with -MASTERDOWN error.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAny other reply (or no reply at all) is considered non valid.\\\\\\\\nHowever note that **a logical master that advertises itself as a replica in\\\\\\\\nthe INFO output is considered to be down**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote that SDOWN requires that no acceptable reply is received for the whole\\\\\\\\ninterval configured, so for instance if the interval is 30000 milliseconds\\\\\\\\n(30 seconds) and we receive an acceptable ping reply every 29 seconds, the\\\\\\\\ninstance is considered to be working.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSDOWN is not enough to trigger a failover: it only means a single Sentinel\\\\\\\\nbelieves a Redis instance is not available. To trigger a failover, the\\\\\\\\nODOWN state must be reached.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo switch from SDOWN to ODOWN no strong consensus algorithm is used, but\\\\\\\\njust a form of gossip: if a given Sentinel gets reports that a master\\\\\\\\nis not working from enough Sentinels **in a given time range**, the SDOWN is\\\\\\\\npromoted to ODOWN. If this acknowledge is later missing, the flag is cleared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA more strict authorization that uses an actual majority is required in\\\\\\\\norder to really start the failover, but no failover can be triggered without\\\\\\\\nreaching the ODOWN state.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe ODOWN condition **only applies to masters**. For other kind of instances\\\\\\\\nSentinel doesn\\'t require to act, so the ODOWN state is never reached for replicas\\\\\\\\nand other sentinels, but only SDOWN is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever SDOWN has also semantic implications. For example a replica in SDOWN\\\\\\\\nstate is not selected to be promoted by a Sentinel performing a failover.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels and replicas auto discovery\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinels stay connected with other Sentinels in order to reciprocally\\\\\\\\ncheck the availability of each other, and to exchange messages. However you\\\\\\\\ndon\\'t need to configure a list of other Sentinel addresses in every Sentinel\\\\\\\\ninstance you run, as Sentinel uses the Redis instances Pub/Sub capabilities\\\\\\\\nin order to discover the other Sentinels that are monitoring the same masters\\\\\\\\nand replicas.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis feature is implemented by sending *hello messages* into the channel named\\\\\\\\n`__sentinel__:hello`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSimilarly you don\\'t need to configure what is the list of the replicas attached\\\\\\\\nto a master, as Sentinel will auto discover this list querying Redis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel publishes a message to every monitored master and replica Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello`, every two seconds, announcing its presence with ip, port, runid.\\\\\\\\n* Every Sentinel is subscribed to the Pub/Sub channel `__sentinel__:hello` of every master and replica, looking for unknown sentinels. When new sentinels are detected, they are added as sentinels of this master.\\\\\\\\n* Hello messages also include the full current configuration of the master. If the receiving Sentinel has a configuration for a given master which is older than the one received, it updates to the new configuration immediately.\\\\\\\\n* Before adding a new sentinel to a master a Sentinel always checks if there is already a sentinel with the same runid or the same address (ip and port pair). In that case all the matching sentinels are removed, and the new added.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSentinel reconfiguration of instances outside the failover procedure\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven when no failover is in progress, Sentinels will always try to set the\\\\\\\\ncurrent configuration on monitored instances. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Replicas (according to the current configuration) that claim to be masters, will be configured as replicas to replicate with the current master.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas connected to a wrong master, will be reconfigured to replicate with the right master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor Sentinels to reconfigure replicas, the wrong configuration must be observed for some time, that is greater than the period used to broadcast new configurations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis prevents Sentinels with a stale configuration (for example because they just rejoined from a partition) will try to change the replicas configuration before receiving an update.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAlso note how the semantics of always trying to impose the current configuration makes the failover more resistant to partitions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* Masters failed over are reconfigured as replicas when they return available.\\\\\\\\n* Replicas partitioned away during a partition are reconfigured once reachable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe important lesson to remember about this section is: **Sentinel is a system where each process will always try to impose the last logical configuration to the set of monitored instances**.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.5672,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"3022c99e-012\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/operate/oss_and_stack/management/scaling.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Scale with Redis Cluster\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Create and use a Redis Cluster > Test the failover\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"To trigger the failover, the simplest thing we can do (that is also\\\\\\\\nthe semantically simplest failure that can occur in a distributed system)\\\\\\\\nis to crash a single process, in our case a single master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nDuring this test, you should take a tab open with the consistency test\\\\\\\\napplication running.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can identify a master and crash it with the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes | grep master\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385482984082 0 connected 5960-10921\\\\\\\\n2938205e12de373867bf38f1ca29d31d0ddb3e46 127.0.0.1:7002 master - 0 1385482983582 0 connected 11423-16383\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOk, so 7000, 7001, and 7002 are masters.

This may\\\\\\\\nsound unexpected as in the first part of this tutorial we stated that Redis\\\\\\\\nCluster can lose writes during the failover because it uses asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication. What we did not say is that this is not very likely to happen\\\\\\\\nbecause Redis sends the reply to the client, and the commands to replicate\\\\\\\\nto the replicas, about at the same time, so there is a very small window to\\\\\\\\nlose data.

Sentinel 获取新的 master 地址并重连。\n\n## 具体实现步骤\n\n### 1. 客户端配置\n- 配置 Sentinel 地址列表（而非 master IP）\n- 配置服务名称（如 \"mymaster\"）\n- 启用连接池的健康检查（如 `testOnBorrow`）\n\n### 2. 自动重连流程\n客户端在以下情况会重新向 Sentinel 查询 master 地址：\n- 连接超时或 socket 错误\n- 连接被显式关闭或重连\n- 收到 Redis 的 `CLIENT KILL` 命令（Sentinel 在重配置实例时会发送）\n\n### 3. 地址解析过程\n```bash\n# 客户端调用 Sentinel API 获取当前 master\nSENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n```\n\n### 4. 验证机制\n客户端连接后应使用 `ROLE` 命令验证实例角色，避免连接到过期的 master（已降级为 replica）。\n\n## 配置建议\n\n**连接池配置：**\n```\nminEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000  # 空闲连接回收时间\ntestOnBorrow=true                  # 借用时测试连接\n```\n\n**注意事项：**\n- 所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\n- 对于连接池，当检测到 master 地址变化时，应关闭所有现有连接并连接到新地址\n- 等待 30 秒观察错误率是否下降（Sentinel 客户端自动切换需要时间）\n\n## 如果应用直连了 master IP\n\n需要手动处理：\n1. 获取新 master 地址：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\n2. 更新应用配置\n3. 滚动重启应用\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 恢复操作 > 手动恢复]**  \n**[来源:

However if the master address changes, manual intervention in every client is needed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA Redis client supporting Sentinel can automatically discover the address of a Redis master from the master name using Redis Sentinel. So instead of a hard coded IP address and port, a client supporting Sentinel should optionally be able to take as input:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* A list of ip:port pairs pointing to known Sentinel instances.\\\\\\\\n* The name of the service, like \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\"timelines\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is the procedure a client should follow in order to obtain the master address starting from the list of Sentinels and the service name.\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.792,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"eval-review-001-007\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/eval-review.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"RAG 评测方案 Review > 数据格式设计\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"无论是否引入 Ragas，统一数据格式（兼容 Ragas 的 SingleTurnSample）:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ntest_case = {\\\\\\\\n    # 输入\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"user_input\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"READONLY You can\\'t write against a read only replica 怎么解决\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # 检索结果（从 Agent 日志提取）\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"retrieved_contexts\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Redis Sentinel 触发主从切换后...\\\\\\\\\\\\\",  # chunk text\\\\\\\\n    ],\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Agent 输出\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"response\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"根据文档，这个错误是 Redis Sentinel 主从切换导致的...\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Ground truth（手写）\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"reference\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"READONLY 错误是 Redis Sentinel failover 后，应用仍连接旧 master（已降为 replica）导致。解决方案：使用 Sentinel 客户端自动切换。\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # 元数据\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"expected_doc\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"redis-failover.md\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"source\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"local\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"exact\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n这个格式可以直接喂给:\\\\\\\\n- 我们的自建评估函数\\\\\\\\n- Ragas 的 `SingleTurnSample`\\\\\\\\n- 任何其他评测框架\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 2.6649,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"redis-failover-001-003\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"docs/runbook/redis-failover.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Redis 主从切换故障恢复手册 > 相关文档\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"high\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"- 所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\\\\\\\\n- 连接池配置 `minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000`\\\\\\\\n- 定期演练 failover：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Redis Sentinel 架构设计\\\\\\\\n- 应用连接池配置规范\\\\\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  {\\\\n    \\\\\"score\\\\\": 1.7832,\\\\n    \\\\\"doc_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"chunk_id\\\\\": \\\\\"06e4a139-002\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"path\\\\\": \\\\\"/home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Sentinel client spec\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"section_path\\\\\": \\\\\"Error reporting\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"confidence\\\\\": \\\\\"medium\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Once the service name is resolved into the master address and a connection is established with the Redis master instance, every time a reconnection is needed, the client should resolve again the address using Sentinels restarting from Step 1. For instance Sentinel should contacted again the following cases:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If the client reconnects after a timeout or socket error.\\\\\\\\n* If the client reconnects because it was explicitly closed or reconnected by the user.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the above cases and any other case where the client lost the connection with the Redis server, the client should resolve the master address again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nStarting with Redis 2.8.12, when Redis Sentinel changes the configuration of\\\\\\\\nan instance, for example promoting a replica to a master, demoting a master to\\\\\\\\nreplicate to the new master after a failover, or simply changing the master\\\\\\\\naddress of a stale replica instance, it sends a `CLIENT KILL type normal`\\\\\\\\ncommand to the instance in order to make sure all the clients are disconnected\\\\\\\\nfrom the reconfigured instance. This will force clients to resolve the master\\\\\\\\naddress again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the client will contact a Sentinel with yet not updated information, the verification of the Redis instance role via the [`ROLE`]() command will fail, allowing the client to detect that the contacted Sentinel provided stale information, and will try again.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: it is possible that a stale master returns online at the same time a client contacts a stale Sentinel instance, so the client may connect with a stale master, and yet the ROLE output will match. However when the master is back again Sentinel will try to demote it to replica, triggering a new disconnection. The same reasoning applies to connecting to stale replicas that will get reconfigured to replicate with a different master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSometimes clients are interested to connect to replicas, for example in order to scale read requests. This protocol supports connecting to replicas by modifying step 2 slightly. Instead of calling the following command:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name master-name\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe clients should call instead:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    SENTINEL replicas master-name\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn order to retrieve a list of replica instances.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSymmetrically the client should verify with the [`ROLE`]() command that the\\\\\\\\ninstance is actually a replica, in order to avoid scaling read queries with\\\\\\\\nthe master.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor clients implementing connection pools, on reconnection of a single connection, the Sentinel should be contacted again, and in case of a master address change all the existing connections should be closed and connected to the new address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe client should correctly return the information to the user in case of errors. Specifically:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* If no Sentinel can be contacted (so that the client was never able to get the reply to `SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name`), an error that clearly states that Redis Sentinel is unreachable should be returned.\\\\\\\\n* If all the Sentinels in the pool replied with a null reply, the user should be informed with an error that Sentinels don\\'t know this master name.\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n]\"}', is_error=None)]"}, {"content": "[TextBlock(text='根据检索结果，Redis 主从切换后客户端自动重连的方案如下：\\n\\n## 使用 Sentinel 客户端实现自动重连\\n\\n**核心机制：**\\n客户端不直连 master IP，而是通过 Sentinel 进行服务发现。当 failover 发生时，客户端会自动从 Sentinel 获取新的 master 地址并重连。\\n\\n## 具体实现步骤\\n\\n### 1. 客户端配置\\n- 配置 Sentinel 地址列表（而非 master IP）\\n- 配置服务名称（如 \"mymaster\"）\\n- 启用连接池的健康检查（如 `testOnBorrow`）\\n\\n### 2. 自动重连流程\\n客户端在以下情况会重新向 Sentinel 查询 master 地址：\\n- 连接超时或 socket 错误\\n- 连接被显式关闭或重连\\n- 收到 Redis 的 `CLIENT KILL` 命令（Sentinel 在重配置实例时会发送）\\n\\n### 3. 地址解析过程\\n```bash\\n# 客户端调用 Sentinel API 获取当前 master\\nSENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\\n```\\n\\n### 4. 验证机制\\n客户端连接后应使用 `ROLE` 命令验证实例角色，避免连接到过期的 master（已降级为 replica）。\\n\\n## 配置建议\\n\\n**连接池配置：**\\n```\\nminEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000  # 空闲连接回收时间\\ntestOnBorrow=true                  # 借用时测试连接\\n```\\n\\n**注意事项：**\\n- 所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\\n- 对于连接池，当检测到 master 地址变化时，应关闭所有现有连接并连接到新地址\\n- 等待 30 秒观察错误率是否下降（Sentinel 客户端自动切换需要时间）\\n\\n## 如果应用直连了 master IP\\n\\n需要手动处理：\\n1. 获取新 master 地址：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\\n2. 更新应用配置\\n3. 滚动重启应用\\n\\n---\\n\\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 恢复操作 > 手动恢复]**  \\n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md > Redis service discovery via Sentinel]**')]"}, {"subtype": "success", "result": "根据检索结果，Redis 主从切换后客户端自动重连的方案如下：\n\n## 使用 Sentinel 客户端实现自动重连\n\n**核心机制：**\n客户端不直连 master IP，而是通过 Sentinel 进行服务发现。当 failover 发生时，客户端会自动从 Sentinel 获取新的 master 地址并重连。\n\n## 具体实现步骤\n\n### 1. 客户端配置\n- 配置 Sentinel 地址列表（而非 master IP）\n- 配置服务名称（如 \"mymaster\"）\n- 启用连接池的健康检查（如 `testOnBorrow`）\n\n### 2. 自动重连流程\n客户端在以下情况会重新向 Sentinel 查询 master 地址：\n- 连接超时或 socket 错误\n- 连接被显式关闭或重连\n- 收到 Redis 的 `CLIENT KILL` 命令（Sentinel 在重配置实例时会发送）\n\n### 3. 地址解析过程\n```bash\n# 客户端调用 Sentinel API 获取当前 master\nSENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster\n```\n\n### 4. 验证机制\n客户端连接后应使用 `ROLE` 命令验证实例角色，避免连接到过期的 master（已降级为 replica）。\n\n## 配置建议\n\n**连接池配置：**\n```\nminEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000  # 空闲连接回收时间\ntestOnBorrow=true                  # 借用时测试连接\n```\n\n**注意事项：**\n- 所有应用必须使用 Sentinel 客户端，禁止直连 master IP\n- 对于连接池，当检测到 master 地址变化时，应关闭所有现有连接并连接到新地址\n- 等待 30 秒观察错误率是否下降（Sentinel 客户端自动切换需要时间）\n\n## 如果应用直连了 master IP\n\n需要手动处理：\n1. 获取新 master 地址：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\n2. 更新应用配置\n3. 滚动重启应用\n\n---\n\n**[来源: docs/runbook/redis-failover.md > 恢复操作 > 手动恢复]**  \n**[来源: /home/shenzt/ws/my-agent-kb/docs/redis-docs/develop/reference/sentinel-clients.md > Redis service discovery via Sentinel]**", "session_id": "91215594-fb0a-45a9-a463-fa4903c683dd", "num_turns": 3, "duration_ms": 91296, "total_cost_usd": 0.0552355, "usage": {"input_tokens": 1250, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2502, "cache_read_input_tokens": 31296, "output_tokens": 708, "server_tool_use": {"web_search_requests": 0, "web_fetch_requests": 0}, "service_tier": "standard", "cache_creation": {"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0}, "inference_geo": "", "iterations": []}}]}

"cost_usd": 0.0573265, "num_turns": 3, "answer_length": 1175, "answer": "根据检索到的文档，我来回答 Redis failover 后的数据丢失和一致性问题：\n\n## 数据会丢失吗？\n\n**会有小概率丢失少量数据**，原因如下：\n\nRedis Cluster 使用**异步复制**机制。当主节点接收写命令后，会几乎同时做两件事：\n1. 向客户端返回响应\n2. 将命令复制到从节点\n\n虽然这两个操作时间窗口很小，但仍存在主节点已响应客户端、但数据还未复制到从节点就宕机的情况，此时会丢失这部分写入。\n\n根据 Redis 官方测试数据：在一次 failover 中，系统无法接受 578 次读和 577 次写，但**没有产生数据不一致**。\n\n## 如何保证数据一致性？\n\n### 1. 使用 Sentinel 客户端（必须）\n\n```\n禁止直连 master IP，必须使用 Sentinel 客户端\n```\n\n- 使用 Jedis Sentinel、redis-py Sentinel 等客户端\n- 配置 Sentinel 地址而非 master 地址\n- 客户端会自动发现新 master 并切换连接\n\n### 2. 连接池配置\n\n```\nminEvictableIdleTimeMillis=60000\ntestOnBorrow=true\n```\n\n确保连接池能及时检测并剔除失效连接。\n\n### 3. 定期演练 failover\n\n```bash\nredis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL failover mymaster\n```\n\n通过定期演练验证应用的容错能力。\n\n### 4. 监控关键指标\n\n- 监控 Sentinel 日志中的 `+switch-master` 事件\n- 监控应用日志中的 `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica` 错误\n- 监控 Redis 写入延迟\n\n## 故障恢复流程\n\n如果应用使用 Sentinel 客户端：\n1. 连接会自动切换到新 master\n2. 等待 30 秒观察错误率下降\n\n如果应用直连 master IP（不推荐）：\n1. 获取新 master：`redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster`\n2. 更新应用配置\n3.

This may\\\\\\\\nsound unexpected as in the first part of this tutorial we stated that Redis\\\\\\\\nCluster can lose writes during the failover because it uses asynchronous\\\\\\\\nreplication. What we did not say is that this is not very likely to happen\\\\\\\\nbecause Redis sends the reply to the client, and the commands to replicate\\\\\\\\nto the replicas, about at the same time, so there is a very small window to\\\\\\\\nlose data. However the fact that it is hard to trigger does not mean that it\\\\\\\\nis impossible, so this does not change the consistency guarantees provided\\\\\\\\nby Redis cluster.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can now check what is the cluster setup after the failover (note that\\\\\\\\nin the meantime I restarted the crashed instance so that it rejoins the\\\\\\\\ncluster as a replica):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n$ redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes\\\\\\\\n3fc783611028b1707fd65345e763befb36454d73 127.0.0.1:7004 slave 3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 0 1385503418521 0 connected\\\\\\\\na211e242fc6b22a9427fed61285e85892fa04e08 127.0.0.1:7003 slave 97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 0 1385503419023 0 connected\\\\\\\\n97a3a64667477371c4479320d683e4c8db5858b1 :0 myself,master - 0 0 0 connected 0-5959 10922-11422\\\\\\\\n3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 127.0.0.1:7005 master - 0 1385503419023 3 connected 11423-16383\\\\\\\\n3e3a6cb0d9a9a87168e266b0a0b24026c0aae3f0 127.0.0.1:7001 master - 0 1385503417005 0 connected 5960-10921\\\\\\\\n2938205e12de373867bf38f1ca29d31d0ddb3e46 127.0.0.1:7002 slave 3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 0 1385503418016 3 connected\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow the masters are running on ports 7000, 7001 and 7005.
