# Today's High: What It Is, How It Works, Example

Today&#x27;s high refers to a security&#x27;s intraday high trading price or the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the day.This can be contrasted with today's low, which is the trading day's intraday low price. Today's high provides information to traders and investors on a stock's price, what news is driving the price that day, what might be a good entry and exit point into and out of the stock, and what the future outlook of the stock's price might be. Today's high is the highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day and is typically higher than the closing or equal to the opening price. It may be used when calculating a moving average. One way that day traders and technical analysts use today's high, along with today's low, is to help them identify gaps or sudden jumps up or down in a stock's price with no trading in between those two prices. Short-term traders, such as day traders, use intraday price movements and charts to determine the correct time to enter or exit a trade. Based upon this analysis, they implement trading strategies and capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.
