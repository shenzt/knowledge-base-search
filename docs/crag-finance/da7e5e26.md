# Treasury Yield Definition | Investing Dictionary | U.S. News

The driving principle behind treasury yields is demand. In other words, the higher the demand for treasury bonds, the lower the yield and vice versa. Yields drop when demand is high and rise when demand is low.That's because bonds can be sold on the secondary market, where investors can purchase previously issued financial instruments like bonds. If prices on the secondary market differ from the primary market, yields automatically adjust accordingly. For example, if you purchase a bond on the secondary market at a lower price than it originally sold for, its yield would rise because the Treasury still has to issue a payment equal to what the original yield would have produced. Investors typically want to earn as much as possible on their investments, and Treasury bonds are relatively safe investments that don't tend to pay out as much as other investments, such as stocks or real estate. The Treasury sells bonds at auction, and prices and yields change along with demand. If Treasury yields are high, it means that bond prices are low and investor demand is low due to higher confidence in other investments. The reverse also holds true. Treasury yields are a useful indicator of the market's economic outlook. If Treasury yields show that a period of economic growth is likely, investors may want to rebalance their portfolios to include more aggressive, riskier investments to take advantage of shifting macroeconomic conditions. This is a crucial economic benchmark because it affects other interest rates. Mortgage rates and other borrowing costs also tend to increase when the yield on the 10-year note goes up.
