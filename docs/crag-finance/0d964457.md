# Coca-Cola risks being unseated as the highest-valued beverage company ...

PepsiCo is on course to take over as the biggest U.S. beverage company by market value, analyst says.PepsiCo is on course to take over as the biggest US beverage company by market value, supplanting rival Coca-Cola, which has held the spot largely uninterrupted for the better part of two decades. That’s according to Wall Street analysts including Kaumil Gajrawala at Jefferies, who has initiated coverage of PepsiCo with a buy rating, calling it the sector’s “most durable business.” He projects the shares will rise more than 20% over the next year to $203, for a market value of about $279 billion. That would top the roughly $277 billion market capitalization implied by his $64 target for Coca-Cola, which he rates a hold. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is exclusively a beverage company. For PepsiCo, “hefty investments over the last half decade are yielding results, and we expect returns to accelerate,” Gajrawala wrote in a note to clients, highlighting that the company has invested about $60 billion over the past five years to make operations more efficient, increase capacity and build its brand. The call, echoed by analysts from Cowen and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., would mark a telling reversal for the soda giants: Aside from a single day in 2020, PepsiCo’s value hasn’t eclipsed Coca-Cola’s since 2006. At roughly $246 billion on Monday, Coca-Cola’s market cap is nearly $15 billion above PepsiCo’s. Coca-Cola has long held down the top spot in part due to its strong brand portfolio and record of sales growth. But PepsiCo’s food business, including Lay’s potato chips, Doritos and Quaker oatmeal, has become a key differentiator. Gajrawala expects PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay North America business will continue to outperform its other products. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is exclusively a beverage company.
