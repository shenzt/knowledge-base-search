# Tesla (TSLA) earnings Q1 2022

Revenue growth was driven in part by an increase in the number of cars Tesla delivered, and an increase in average sales pricesEarly this month, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 310,048 for the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comprised 95%, or 295,324, of deliveries in the period ending March 31, 2022. In its energy segment, Tesla's solar deployments dropped by nearly half to 48 MW in the first quarter of 2022 versus the same time last year. The company deployed 846 MWh of lithium ion based battery energy storage systems, up 90% from the same time last year, but down from the previous quarter. The company said declines in solar deployments were caused by import delays on certain components that were beyond Tesla's control. Amid inflationary pressures, parts and semiconductor chip shortages exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic and Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, Tesla global vehicle inventory dwindled to a three-day supply in the first quarter of 2022. That's down from a four-day supply of global vehicle inventory in the previous quarter, and eight-day supply during the first quarter of 2021.
