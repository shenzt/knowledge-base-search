Two categories known for paying above-average yields are utilities and REITs, or real estate investment trusts. But just as with any other dividend stock, don&amp;#x27;t assume that the highest-yielding ones are the best. Be sure to evaluate business quality and whether a company&amp;#x27;s cash flows support a dividend.",

U.S. companies typically pay dividends quarterly, though some pay less often, and a few even pay monthly.Dividends are generally paid in cash, but some companies pay in &amp;quot;scrip,&amp;quot; which is dividends paid in stock. Note that this is not the same as a dividend reinvestment program, or DRIP, where a company (or your brokerage) automatically takes your cash dividend and purchases shares for you.",

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "It can vary by sector and even particular industries within a sector, but the most important answer is &amp;quot;one that can be sustained.&amp;quot; This is why chasing yield is so dangerous, as a high yield that can&amp;#x27;t be maintained is no good at all.A useful metric to help determine a dividend&amp;#x27;s safety is the dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of a company&amp;#x27;s earnings that it pays out in dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the safer a dividend generally is.",

Whether you&amp;#x27;re looking for income or just the best possible total returns, chances are there are many dividend stocks that can be ideal ways to reach your financial goals. Just remember that yield is often less important than other factors, such as a company&amp;#x27;s ability to maintain and grow the payout for the long term.",

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "A dividend occurs when a company sends money (or stock, though very rarely) to its shareholders. When a company gets to the point that it consistently earns more than management can effectively reinvest, establishing a dividend policy and sending those excess profits back to investors is a smart move.",
