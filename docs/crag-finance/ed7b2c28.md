# How to Calculate a Stock's Adjusted Closing Price

When the day&#x27;s trading is done, all stocks are priced at close. The adjusted closing price accounts for any distribution that affects the price.For example, let's assume that the closing price for one share of XYZ Corp. is $20 on Thursday. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). These distributions may include cash dividends, stock dividends, or stock splits. The adjusted closing price is often used when examining historical returns or performing a detailed analysis of historical returns. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. After the close on Thursday, XYZ Corp. announces a dividend distribution of $1.50 per share. The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50). If XYZ Corp. announces a 2:1 stock dividend instead of a cash dividend, the adjusted closing price calculation will change. When distributions are made, the adjusted closing price calculations are simple. For cash dividends, the value of the dividend is deducted from the last closing sale price of the stock.
