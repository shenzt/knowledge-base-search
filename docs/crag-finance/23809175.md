# How and When Are Stock Dividends Paid Out?

A dividend is usually declared quarterly after a company finalizes its income statement and dividends are paid either by check or in additional shares of stock.A dividend is the distribution of some of a company's earnings as cash to a class of its shareholders. Dividends typically are credited to a brokerage account or paid in the form of a dividend check. The dividend check is mailed to stockholders but can be direct-deposited to a shareholder's account of choice, if preferred.
