**Financing Led by Leading U.S. Life Sciences-focused Investors**

PETACH TIKVA, Israel, Jan. 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PolyPid Ltd. (Nasdaq: PYPD) (“PolyPid” or the “Company”), a late-stage biopharma company aiming to improve surgical outcomes, today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement financing (the “PIPE”) for $16.2 million in gross proceeds priced at the 5-day volume weighted average price as of January 2, 2024 of $4.81 per share. The PIPE syndicate is comprised of new and existing investors, including participation from new U.S. life sciences-focused investors, DAFNA Capital Management and Rosalind Advisors.

Under the securities purchase agreement, the investors have agreed to purchase 3,371,312 of the Company’s ordinary shares, no par value per share (the “Ordinary Shares”), or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof, at a purchase price of $4.81 per share (or pre-funded warrant). The investors will also receive warrants to purchase up to 3,371,312 Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $5.50 per share. The warrants expire upon the earlier of two years from the date of issuance and 10 trading days following PolyPid’s announcement of the positive recommendation by Data Safety Monitoring Board regarding the Company’s unblinded interim analysis in its SHIELD II Phase 3 trial of D-PLEX100 resulting in the stopping of the trial due to positive efficacy. Exercise of the warrants in full would result in an additional $18.5 million in gross proceeds to the Company.

The PIPE is expected to close on January 9, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities for its ongoing SHIELD II phase 3 clinical trial for the prevention of surgical site infections in patients undergoing abdominal colorectal surgery, working capital and general corporate purposes.

JMP Securities, A Citizens Company, is acting as exclusive placement agent in the offering.

The offer and sale of the foregoing securities are being made in a transaction not involving a public offering and the securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the securities may not be reoffered or resold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the PIPE investors, the Company has agreed to file within 30 calendar days of closing one or more registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") covering the resale of the Ordinary Shares and Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and pre-funded warrants.
