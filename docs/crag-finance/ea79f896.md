Vanguard Active Fixed Income perspectives is our quarterly in-depth commentary. It offers a sector-by-sector analysis and a summary of how those views affect the Vanguard active bond funds.

## Key highlights

**Performance:** In mid-October, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note crossed 5%. Then, slower inflation and a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve fueled an all-asset rally to end the year. The 10-year fell quickly below 4% and credit spreads squeezed tighter. Market pricing reflects a soft landing for the economy.

**Looking ahead:** Our positive view on the value of fixed income still holds. We expect interest rates to ultimately settle above the unusually low levels experienced after the 2008 global financial crisis. Investors can capture durable, resilient yields, and if rates decline, additional price appreciation.

**Approach:** Credit spreads are narrow, but overall yields remain attractive. We still hold an up-in-quality bias. Corporate credit and high-yield spreads should widen later this year as the economy weakens, but not to extremes. We await a better entry point to add lower-quality risk. Municipal bonds exhibit strong fundamentals and attractive tax-adjusted yields, with the most value out on the curve and down in credit rating.

The descent from Yield Mountain

## **The descent from Yield Mountain**

Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is famous in finance for being the site of the Federal Reserve’s annual August symposium, but it is also home of one of the top ski resorts in the world. The skiing area on Après Vous and Rendezvous mountains features a 4,139-foot vertical drop, and half the runs are recommended for experts only.

Bond investors who rode a figurative gondola to what was likely the top of “Yield Mountain” in October experienced the thrill of the sudden descent in the following two months. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which began 2023 at 3.84%, fell from 5% in mid-October to back under 4% by mid-December.

* The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index returned 9.29% between October 19 and December 31; investors who stood safely in cash may have felt that they missed out.

**What’s next?** In 2024, we expect:

* Inflation, as measured by the core Personal Consumer Expenditures Price Index (core PCE), to fall steadily and end the year just above the Fed’s 2% target.
* The Fed to cut rates. More easing would occur in a recession, but in either case we don’t expect policy rates to return t
