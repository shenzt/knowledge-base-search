### Credit Cards

A credit card is a small plastic card issued by a bank, business, or other organization, allowing the holder to make purchases or withdrawals on credit, which is a form of unsecured loan from the issuer. There is a maximum amount of credit that a card can provide, called a credit limit, which should not be surpassed. Exceeding the limit may require the credit card holder to pay a credit limit fee. At the end of the month, the credit card holder can choose to repay the entire amount or leave an unpaid balance that is subject to interest until it is paid off. Note that credit card interest rates tend to be relatively high compared to other common loans such as mortgages, car loans, or student loans, and as such, the balance should ideally be paid off monthly to avoid paying large amounts of interest. Examples of credit card issuers include banks, credit unions, or retailers, and examples of credit card networks include Visa or MasterCard. American Express and Discover are both issuers and networks. Networks charge a small fee (<3%) for handling the processing of the transactions. Issuers profit from interest payments on revolving balances, late fees, annual membership fees, fees for cash withdrawals, interchange fees, etc.

**APR**

Different cards offer varying rates of interest, often referred to as the annual percentage rate, or APR. Some cards have variable APRs, based on specific indexes, and others have fixed APRs. There are some credit cards that are specifically advertised as having a zero, introductory, annual percentage rate (APR).

**Cash Advances**

It is possible to withdraw credit from a credit card for physical cash. This is called a cash advance, and they usually have very high APRs. There is no grace period as interest accumulates immediately, cash advances don't count towards rewards, and there is usually a cash advance fee. On top of that, the ATM used will probably also charge a fee. Normally, credit card cash advances are not very advantageous, and should generally be reserved for emergencies.

**Balance Transfers**

It is possible to transfer the balance from one credit card to another. People who carry revolving credit month-to-month can probably consider applying for a favorable balance-transfer credit card, usually in the form of one with a low or zero introductory rate. For instance, a spender who has accrued lots of debt on a high-interest r
