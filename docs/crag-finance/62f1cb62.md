# How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading

Volume is a simple yet powerful way for traders and investors to increase profits and minimize risks.In the case of a pullback in a stock or market, the volume should be lower than it is when the price is moving in the direction of the trend, typically higher. Lower volume indicates that traders do not have much conviction in the pullback, and it may suggest that the market’s upward trend could continue, making the pullback a buying opportunity.
