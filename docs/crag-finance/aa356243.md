# Tesla Earnings: What Happened with TSLA

Tesla&#x27;s (TSLA) Q4 earnings and revenue surpassed analysts&#x27; consensus estimates. Vehicle deliveries rose at a robust pace.On a call with analysts after earnings were announced, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk said that he expects Tesla to remain “chip-limited” in 2022, and that Tesla would introduce no new vehicle models this year as a result. On the call, executives made projections for revenue growth “comfortably above 50% in 2022.” · Tesla's next earnings report (for Q1 FY 2022) is expected to be released on April 25, 2022. Tesla's primary business is making electric vehicles, and it needs to continue expanding production in order to grow revenue and profits. Ongoing challenges in global supply chains limited its ability to run its factories at full capacity. "Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022," the company said. Visible Alpha.
