From another angle, the S&amp;amp;P 500, as an index, is a statistical measure of the performance of America&amp;#x27;s 500 largest stocks. In this context, the S&amp;amp;P 500 is a common benchmark against which portfolio performance can be evaluated.",

"text": "A stock market index shows how investors feel an economy is faring. An index collects data from a variety of companies across industries. Together, that data forms a picture that helps investors compare current price levels with past prices to calculate market performance. Some indexes focus on a smaller subset of the market. For example, the Nasdaq index closely tracks the technology sector. So, if you want to know how technology companies are performing, you\u2019d want to look at the Nasdaq stock index.",

"text": "The Nasdaq Composite is a stock market index that consists of the stocks that are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. To be included in the index:A stock must be listed exclusively on the Nasdaq market.The stock must be a common stock of an individual company, so preferred stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other types of securities are excluded.American depositary receipts (ADRs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and shares of limited partnerships are eligible, however.That&amp;#x27;s why there are so many stocks included in the Nasdaq Composite and why the number of stocks in the index changes often. The index is designed to be representative of the entire Nasdaq stock market, not just the largest companies.",
