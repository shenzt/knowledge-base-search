According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, these 5 tech stocks were responsible for more than 20% of the S&P 500’s 31% return in 2019.

Is the rest of the market participating in this rally or is it all being driven by just a small number of stocks?

While technology firms dominate the top slots today, in the early-1980s it was energy companies. The behemoth tech stocks have taken advantage of these trends but it was not preordained that these companies would be where they are today. Apple was rescued by Microsoft with a $150 million loan in 1997 which was one year before Google was founded. Jeff Bezos started Amazon in a garage in 1994.
