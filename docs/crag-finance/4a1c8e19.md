# How to Use Stock Volume to Improve Your Trading

Volume is a simple yet powerful way for traders and investors to increase profits and minimize risks.At a market bottom, falling prices eventually force out large numbers of traders, resulting in volatility and increased volume. We will see a decrease in volume after the spike in these situations, but how volume continues to play out over the next days, weeks, and months can be analyzed by using the other volume guidelines. Daily volume is the most common time frame used when discussing stock volume. Average daily trading volume is the daily volume of shares traded, averaged over a number of days; this smooths out days when trading volume is unusually low or high.
