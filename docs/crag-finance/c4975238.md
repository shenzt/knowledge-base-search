# Average Daily Trading Volume (ADTV): Definition, How To Use It

Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares that change hands for a stock. This average is useful for determining which stocks are suitable for certain investors.Average daily trading volume (ADTV) is the average number of shares traded within a day in a given stock. Daily volume equates to how many shares are traded each day, but this can be averaged over a number of days to find the average daily volume. Average daily trading volume is an important metric because high or low trading volume attracts different types of traders and investors. Average daily trading volume is a commonly used metric and is useful for determining if a stock meets an investor's or trader's trade parameters. ADTV is an average, though. On any given day an asset can deviate from the average, producing much higher or lower volume. Then divide the total by X. For example, add the last 20 days of trading volume and divide by 20 to get the 20-day ADTV. Sizable volume increases signify something is changing in the stock that is attracting more interest. This sentiment could be bearish or bullish, depending on the price direction. Decreasing volume shows interest is waning, but even declining volume is useful because when higher volume returns there is often a strong price push as well. Traders and investors alike pay close attention to ADTV because it provides valuable information about the liquidity and market interest in a particular security. Risk was also managed by using the trading limit along with the ADTV crossover, allowing the stock trader to easily exit the position. This example was for illustrative purposes only and is not a recommendation to buy or sell GE stock. Also, the criteria for trading limits as well as ADTV are purely for illustration. Volume is sometimes confused with open interest. Average daily trading volume is the average of how many shares (stock market) or contracts (futures and options market) change hands in a day.
