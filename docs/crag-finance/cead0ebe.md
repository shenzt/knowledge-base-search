# Market Capitalization: What It Is, Formula for Calculating It

Market capitalization, or &quot;market cap&quot; is the aggregate market value of a company represented in dollar amount.Market capitalization, or "market cap", is the aggregate market value of a company represented in a dollar amount. Since it represents the “market” value of a company, it is computed based on the current market price (CMP) of its shares and the total number of outstanding shares. Since capitalization represents a dollar value that can vary widely, different buckets and associated nomenclatures exist for categorizing the different market cap ranges. Below are the commonly used standards for each capitalization. Companies that are considered micro-cap consist mostly of penny stocks—this category denotes companies with market capitalizations between $50 million to $300 million. For instance, a lesser-known pharma company with no marketable product and working on developing a drug for an incurable disease, or a five-person company working on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered robotics technology may be listed with a small valuation and limited trading activity. Companies may be categorized as large-, mid-, or small-cap depending on their market capitalization. Blue-chip companies are often large- or mega-cap stocks, while the very smallest are referred to as micro-caps. Market cap is calculated by multiplying a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share.
