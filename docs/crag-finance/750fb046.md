# Tesla reports record revenue and beats on earnings

Electric vehicle maker Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.Tesla reported automotive revenue of $21.3 billion in the fourth quarter, representing 33% growth year-over-year. $467 million of that came from regulatory credits in the fourth quarter of 2022, up by nearly half from the prior year in the same period. In a shareholder deck, the company acknowledged that average sales prices have "generally been on a downward trajectory for many years," and said "affordability" would be necessary for Tesla to grow into a company that sells multiple millions of cars annually. In late 2022 and this year, Tesla cut prices on its cars around the world, upsetting customers in the U.S. and China who recently bought new Teslas at higher prices, and triggering an instant decline in used Tesla prices in the U.S. as well. Shareholders asked a question about how Musk plans to safeguard Tesla's brand and reputation from any backlash resulting from his political statements, and new job as the CEO of Twitter, the social media company he acquired in October 2022. Musk replied by promoting Twitter as a great way to connect with customers: Automotive revenue amounted to $21.3 billion in the three months ending 2022, and included $324 million of deferred revenue related to the company's driver assistance systems. Automotive gross margins came in at 25.9%, the lowest figure in the last five quarters. ... Tesla founder Elon Musk attends Offshore Northern Seas 2022 in Stavanger, Norway, August 29, 2022.
